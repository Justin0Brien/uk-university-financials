Introduction
Our Vision for Anglia Ruskin University reflects the foundation of the Cambridge School of Art (now part of Anglia Ruskin
University) by John Ruskin in 1858 in that:
• We are passionate about the advancement of knowledge and the education of students
• We take university education in imaginative new directions
• We are important to the region and want to be viewed in the UK and internationally as exceptional
• Our key contribution is to the enhancement of social, cultural and economic wellbeing.
Our Corporate Plan 2012 - 2014 sets out in at a slower pace than we would have recruiting in record numbers so that the

28. Pension Arrangements of the Group
Anglia Ruskin University’s employees belong to two principal pension schemes, the Teachers’ Pension Scheme England and Wales (TPS) for academic
and related staff; and the Essex County Council Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) for non-teaching staff, which are both of the defined benefit
type. The Group also administers a stakeholder pension scheme.

Other: contributions payable 120 - 84 -
Total pension charge to Income and Expenditure Account (staff costs) 9,504 9,384 8,971 8,887
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independant qualified actuaries. The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS was 31 March
2012 and of the LGPS 31 March 2013.
Teachers’ Pension Scheme
The TPS is a statutory, contributory, defined benefit scheme. The regulations under which the TPS operates are the Teachers’ Pension Regulations 2010.
These regulations apply to teachers in schools and other educational establishments in England and Wales maintained by local authorities, to teachers
in many independent and voluntary-aided schools, and to teachers and lecturers in establishments of further and higher education. Membership is
automatic for full-time teachers and lecturers and from 1 January 2007 automatic too for teachers and lecturers in part-time employment following
appointment or a change of contract Teachers and lecturers are able to opt out of the TPS.
The Teachers’ Pension Budgeting and Valuation Account
Although teachers and lecturers are employed by various bodies, their retirement and other pension benefits, including annual increases payable under
the Pensions (Increase) Acts are, as provided for in the Superannuation Act 1972, paid out of monies provided by Parliament. Under the unfunded TPS,
teachers contributions on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ basis, and employers’ contributions, are credited to the Exchequer under arrangements governed by the
above Act.
The Teachers’ Pension Regulations require an annual account, the Teachers’ Pension Budgeting and Valuation Account, to be kept of receipts and
expenditure (including the cost of pensions’ increases). From 1 April 2001, the Account has been credited with a real rate of return (in excess of price
increases and currently set at 3.5%), which is equivalent to assuming that the balance in the Account is invested in notional investments that produce that
real rate of return.
Valuation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme
The last formal actuarial valuation undertaken by the Government Actuary for the Teachers’ Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2012 and
was reported in June 2014.
Approximate actuarial assessments in intervening years between formal valuations, using updated membership data, are accepted as providing suitably
robust figures for financial purposes.
The valuation balance sheet at 31 March 2012 included £176.6 billion of aggregate scheme assets and £191.5 billion of aggregate scheme liabilities. The
shortfall at the valuation date was therefor £14.9 billion. The assumed discount rate is 3% (real rate) and 5.06% (nominal rate). The valuation also assumes
pension increases of 2% per annum and long-term salary growth of 4.75% per annum, 2.75 % per annum in excess of assumed CPI.
Scheme Changes
From 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2014, the employee contribution rate ranged between 6.4% and 8.8%, depending on a member’s full time equivalent salary,
with employer contributions set at 14.1%. With effect from 1 April 2014, the employee contribution rates were increased and ranged between 6.4% and
12.4% depending on a member’s full time equivalent salary, with employer contributions set to increase to 16.48% from September 2015.
The total Group contributions made for the year ended 31 July 2014 were £6,674,631 (2013: £5,707,757), of which employers’ contributions totalled
£3,921,051 (2013: £3,565,185) and employees’ contributions totalled £2,753,580 (2013: £2,142,572).
FRS 17
Under the definitions set out in Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 Retirement Benefits, the TPS is a multi-employer scheme. Anglia Ruskin University is
unable to identify its share of the underlying assets of the scheme. Accordingly, Anglia Ruskin has adopted the appropriate treatment in FRS17 and
has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Anglia Ruskin has set out above the information available
on the scheme and the implications for Anglia Ruskin in terms of contribution rates.
Actuarial scheme valuations are dependant on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and many other factors. Many of these
are being discussed in the context of the design for a reformed TPS, as set out in the Proposed Final Agreement, and scheme valuations are, therefore,
currently suspended. The Government however, has set out a future process for determining the employer contribution rate under the new scheme, and
this process will involve a full actuarial valuation.

Early retirement costs met by Anglia Ruskin University
The University holds a provision in respect of enhanced pension entitlements of staff taking early retirement.
Interest of £124k (2013: £141k) has been charged to the income and expenditure account. In addition, a further £250k (2013: £250k) has been charged
to the income and expenditure account. Both the interest and the additional charge are included in note 17a. The provision is released against the cost
to Anglia Ruskin of enhanced pension entitlements over the estimated life expectancy of each relevant employee. The calculation of the cost of early
retirement charged to the income and expenditure account in the year of retirement is based on the total capital cost of providing enhanced pensions
with allowance for future investment returns at 4.5% in excess of price inflation.
A requirement for the employer to meet the cost of the strain placed upon the funds from early retirements was introduced from 1 April 1996 for the
LGPS and 1 July 1997 for the TPS. In the case of the latter, a provision is also made for liabilities accrued in this respect.
Liabilities incurred in this regard for the LGPS fund are paid in the year they are accrued.
