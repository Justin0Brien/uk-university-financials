recent years in research and innovation.
Our students are now more satisfied than ever before, according
to our National Student Survey results, where our teaching,
personal development, assessment and feedback ranked highly in

We have been nominated for a Lloyd’s Bank National Business
Award for university entrepreneurship, following up our Times

22. Pension Arrangements of the Group
Anglia Ruskin University’s employees belong to two principal pension schemes, the Teachers’ Pension Scheme England and Wales (TPS) for
academic and related staff; and the Essex County Council Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) for non-teaching staff, which is managed by
Essex County Council. Both are defined benefit schemes. The group also administers a stakeholder pension scheme.

The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries. The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS was 31
March 2012 and of the LGPS 31 March 2013.
Contributions amounting to £1,148,440 (2015 £1,057,173) were payable to the scheme at 31 July and are included within creditors.
Teachers’ Pension Scheme
The Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) is a statutory, contributory, defined benefit scheme, governed by the Teachers’ Pension Regulations 2010,
and from 1 April 2014, by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme Regulations 2014. These regulations apply to teachers in schools and other educational
establishments, including academies, in England and Wales maintained by local authorities. In addition, teachers in many independent and
voluntary-aided schools and lecturers in some establishments of further and higher education may be eligible for membership. Membership is
automatic for full-time teachers and lecturers and from 1 January 2007, automatic too for teachers and lecturers in part-time employment following
appointment or a change of contract. Teachers and lecturers are able to opt out of the TPS.
The Teachers’ Pension Budgeting and Valuation Account
Although members may be employed by various bodies, their retirement and other pension benefits are set in regulations made under the
Superannuation Act 1972 and are paid by public funds provided by Parliament. The TPS is an unfunded scheme and members contribute on a ‘pay
as you go’ basis - these contributions, along with those made by employers, are credited to the Exchequer under arrangements governed by the
above Act.
The Teachers’ Pension Regulations 2010 require an annual account, the Teachers’ Pension Budgeting and Valuation Account, to be kept of receipts
and expenditure (including the cost of pensions’ increases). From 1 April 2001, the Account has been credited with a real rate of return which is
equivalent to assuming that the balance in the Account is invested in notional investments that produce that real rate of return.
Valuation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme
The latest actuarial review of the TPS was carried out as at 31 March 2012 and in accordance with The Public Service Pensions (Valuations and
Employer Cost Cap) Directions 2014. The valuation report was published by the Department of Education (the Department) on 9 June 2014. The
key results of the valuation are:
• employer contribution rates were set at 16.4% of pensionable pay;
• total scheme liabilities for service to the effective date of £191.5 billion, and notional assets of £176.6 billion, giving a notional past service deficit
of £14.9 billion;
• an employer cost cap of 10.9% of pensionable pay
The new employer contribution rate for the TPS was implemented in September 2015.
A full copy of the valuation report and supporting documentation can be found on the Teachers’ Pension Scheme website at the following location:
https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/news/employers/2014/06/publication-of-the-valuation-report.aspx
Scheme Changes
Following the Hutton report in March 2011 and the subsequent consultations with trade unions and other representative bodies on reform of the
TPS, the Department published a Proposed Final Agreement, setting out the design for a reformed TPS to be implemented from 1 April 2015.
The key provisions of the reformed scheme include: a pension based on career average earnings; an accrual rate of 1/57th; and a Normal Pension
Age equal to State Pension Age, but with options to enable members to retire earlier or later than their Normal Pension Age. Importantly, pension
benefits built up before 1 April 2015 will be fully protected.
In addition, the Proposed Final Agreement includes a Government commitment that those within 10 years of Normal Pension Age on 1 April 2012
will see no change to the age at which they can retire, and no decrease in the amount of pension they receive when they retire. There will be
further transitional protection, tapered over a three and a half year period, for people who would fall up to three and a half years outside of the
10 year protection. Regulations giving effect to a reformed Teachers’ Pension Scheme came into force on 1 April 2014 and the reformed scheme
commenced on 1 April 2015.T he total Group contributions payable for the year ended 31 July 2016 were £8,067,616 (2015: £7,161,247), of which
employers’ contributions totalled £4,975,821 (2015: £4,102,392) and employees’ contributions totalled £3,091,795 (2015: £3,058,855).

FRS 102 (28)
Under the definitions set out in Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102 (28.11), the TPS is a multi-employer plan. Anglia Ruskin University is unable
to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan. Accordingly, Anglia Ruskin has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 102
and has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution plan. Anglia Ruskin has set out the information available
on the plan and the implications for Anglia Ruskin in terms of the anticipated contribution rates.
Local Government Pension Scheme
The LGPS is a funded defined-benefit plan, with the assets held in separate funds administered by Essex County Council. The total contributions
payable for the year ended 31 July 2016 were £7,316,073, of which employer’s contributions totalled £5,134,919 and employees’ contributions totalled
£2,181,154. The agreed contribution rates for future years are 17.3% for employers and range from 5.5% to 12.5% for employees, depending on salary.

Early retirement costs met by Anglia Ruskin University
The University holds a provision in respect of enhanced pension entitlements of staff taking early retirement. Interest of £87k (2015: £107k) has
been charged to the income and expenditure account. In addition, a further £250k (2015: £250k) has been charged to the income and expenditure
account. Both the interest and the additional charge are included in note 16. The provision is released against the cost to Anglia Ruskin of
enhanced pension entitlements over the estimated life expectancy of each relevant employee. The calculation of the cost of early retirement
charged to the income and expenditure account in the year of retirement is based on the total capital cost of providing enhanced pensions with
allowance for future investment returns at 4.5% in excess of price inflation.
A requirement for the employer to meet the cost of the strain placed upon the funds from early retirements was introduced from 1 April 1996 for
the LGPS and 1 July 1997 for the TPS. In the case of the latter, a provision is also made for liabilities accrued in this respect. Liabilities incurred in this
regard for the LGPS fund are paid in the year they are accrued.
23. Restatement of 2015 Accounts
The 2015 accounts have been restated where applicable for reasons of comparability.
