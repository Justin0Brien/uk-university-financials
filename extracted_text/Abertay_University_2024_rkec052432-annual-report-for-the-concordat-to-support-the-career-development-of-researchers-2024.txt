Statement on how the organisation creates, maintains and embeds a research
             culture that upholds a positive and inclusive environment for researchers at all
             stages of their careers (max 500 words)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             The creation of a positive research culture is firmly embedded within our university
             and research strategies. These affirm our core purpose to develop and sustain an
             inclusive, healthy and supportive culture, welcoming and retaining staff and students
             from a range of backgrounds and inspiring them to achieve their full potential. We
             strive to create a sustainable, supportive and collaborative culture in which our
             researchers can thrive and develop as both researchers and individuals.
                                                                                  
             We are fully engaged with the principles of the Concordat to Support the Career
                                                                                  
             Development of Researchers, the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the
             Concordat on Open Research Data, the Knowledge Exchange Concordat, and the
             Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research, and use these to guide the
             development of our research culture.                                 
                                                                                  
             We promote a positive culture through the implementation of: supportive policies,
             processes and structures; strong leadership; quality infrastructure; excellent
             researcher development opportunities; and efficient systems.         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             We embed EDI in our strategies, policies, operations, and strategic thinking,
             recognising and valuing researchers with different backgrounds, attitudes,
             experiences, and career paths who bring fresh ideas and perspectives to our
             Institution. We believe in the benefits that come from having a diverse population
             and are committed to facilitating the widest possible applicant pool into doctoral
             study.                                                               
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             We occupy a compact campus which fosters collaboration between researchers at
             different career levels and across Schools. Our pan-University Graduate School is
             the central hub of our research activities and has transformed our research
             environment. The Graduate School (of which all academic staff and postgraduate
             students are members) provides an important dedicated space for networking,
             discussing research, training, sharing good practice and supporting peer well-being.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Our commitment to development ensures our researchers have access to, and the
             time for, the development of skills needed for employability, effectiveness, and
             career progression. Our Graduate School offers a comprehensive range of
             professional development opportunities and support including a formal training
             programme (80 events annually), one-to-one support (with funding applications,
             publications, research design, statistics, impact, business development, public
             engagement, and outreach) and a research seminar series. We endeavour to
             develop our researchers to be adaptable and flexible to ensure that they can succeed
                                                                                  
             in an increasingly diverse global research environment and employment market.

We have sought substantial feedback on our research
environment and culture during the reporting period.
Throughout 2023 we took part in the CEDARS survey, ran our
biannual PGRS survey and had our Institution-Led Review of
Postgraduate Research Degrees. We have used feedback
from these three sources to substantially improve our
institutional practices, including: Revising our research
induction process; Developing a new process for PGRS
requiring reasonable adjustments; Creating a new support
page for PGRS and Supervisors; Establishing a new group for
Supervisors to share best practice; and Developing a new
dashboard to monitor PGRS progress.
We substantially revised our staff research induction process
last year to ensure new staff receive important information
about our key processes, compulsory training and University
support in a timely manner, but without information overload.

All new PGRS undertake a compulsory induction programme.
Attendance is strictly monitored and PGRS are not allowed to
progress with their research until all sessions have been
attended.
We have also developed a new process for establishing
reasonable adjustments specifically for our PGRS population.
Students with a disclosed medical condition or diagnosis that
could impact on them undertaking the activities and
examinations associated with their research degree will
receive a Needs Assessment and a Personal Support Plan will
be developed.
We continue to invest in our research environment. Over this
reporting period we have continued to refurbish our buildings
and research laboratories and upgrade equipment. Plans for
refurbishment of our central Graduate School have been
approved and will be undertaken throughout 2024/2025.
We embed EDI in all our research policies and practices to
ensure that they are inclusive, equitable and transparent. We
continually monitor our research pages to ensure that all our
strategies, policies, processes, and guides are up to date.
We have continued to promote a healthy working
environment (we hold an NHS Scotland Healthy Working Lives
Gold Award) and actively address any incidents of bullying,
harassment and poor research integrity.
Academic Managers of Researchers
Our Research Managers continue to receive training on
Research Integrity and EDI and are now required to refresh
this training every three years.
We undertook a survey of our Hybrid and Flexible Working
Policy last year to ensure all our researchers are supported by

Regulations and Researcher Responsibilities is now    
                            compulsory for new researchers.

                            developments in this area will be rolled out in the next
                            reporting period as we establish a new Research, Enterprise

                            All research staff are expected to have bi-annual personal

                            its benefit to staff, the process remained the same over this
                            reporting period. Compliance with the process is managed by
                            People Services. Last year there was a 99% completion rate

             In the coming reporting period (2023/2024), our key objectives are to:
                                                                                  
             1. Review and Revise Training Provision for Research Managers        
             Feedback from the CEDARS survey showed that researchers rated professional
             development and support highly. However, research managers identified a few
                                                                                  
             areas where they had no or limited training and did not feel confident. This included
             managing reviews, supporting research careers and supporting staff with mental
             health issues. We will review training for our Research Managers and Heads of
             Division during 2023/2024 with a view to providing additional support for identified
             gaps.

             Feedback from the CEDARS survey showed that our academic staff felt that their
             workloads were high. We are committed to a reasonable, fair, transparent and
             equitable allocation of workload for academic staff that supports the strategic
             objectives and priorities of the University, whilst also having sensitivity to the
             development needs and circumstances of staff and our obligations outlined under
             the Concordat for the Career Development of Researchers. We will therefore
             undertake a review of workload allocation throughout 2023/2024.      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             3. Develop training for research supervisors to better support PGRS with mental
                health and well-being                                             
             Feedback from our Institution Led Review of Postgraduate Research Degrees
             highlighted that our research supervisors often feel poorly equipped to support

Outline your key objectives in delivering your plan in the coming reporting period
(max 500 words)
In the coming reporting period (2023/2024), our key objectives are to:
1. Review and Revise Training Provision for Research Managers
Feedback from the CEDARS survey showed that researchers rated professional
development and support highly. However, research managers identified a few
areas where they had no or limited training and did not feel confident. This included
managing reviews, supporting research careers and supporting staff with mental
health issues. We will review training for our Research Managers and Heads of
Division during 2023/2024 with a view to providing additional support for identified
gaps.
2. Reviewing workload allocations for research
Feedback from the CEDARS survey showed that our academic staff felt that their
workloads were high. We are committed to a reasonable, fair, transparent and
equitable allocation of workload for academic staff that supports the strategic
objectives and priorities of the University, whilst also having sensitivity to the
development needs and circumstances of staff and our obligations outlined under
the Concordat for the Career Development of Researchers. We will therefore
undertake a review of workload allocation throughout 2023/2024.
3. Develop training for research supervisors to better support PGRS with mental
health and well-being
Feedback from our Institution Led Review of Postgraduate Research Degrees
highlighted that our research supervisors often feel poorly equipped to support

PGRS with issues around mental health and well-being. In order to support this we
             have already created a PGRS and supervisor support page which signposts PGRS and
             supervisors to University and external support in this area. To further improve this
             we have asked our counselling team to create some digital resources for our
                                                                                  
             research supervisors and we have also asked them to contribute a session to our
             compulsory supervisor training. These new resources and training will be developed
             during 2023/2024 and rolled out in 2024/2025.                        
                                                                                  
             4. Develop a new policy and training for the use of AI in research   
             The Graduate School will develop a new policy on the ethical use of AI in research.
             Guidance for both research staff and PGRS will be developed. We will also develop
             training around the ethical use of AI and its strengths and limitations.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             5. Develop a new policy and training for Trusted Research            
             The Graduate School and Research, Enterprise, Innovation and Support teams will
             work together to develop and roll out a University Policy and training on Trusted
             Research to ensure all researchers understand the principles of Trusted Research
             and their responsibilities as researchers.                           
                                                                                  
             6. Develop and undertake an evaluation of our researcher development provision
                                                                                  
             To ensure our researcher development programme is meeting the needs of both our
             staff and PGRS we will undertake an evaluation of the programme in 2023/2024 to
             identify areas for improvement. Evaluation of individual sessions is not currently
             undertaken due to the size of the offering and limited staff capacity. The programme
             will therefore be reviewed more holistically as part of a University wide evaluation
             of our Learning and Development offer. The planned evaluation will focus on
             whether the research programme has improved knowledge and has been applied in
             practice as well as identifying barriers to engagement with researcher development.
