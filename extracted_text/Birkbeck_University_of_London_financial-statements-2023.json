Joanna Bourke's fine history, 'Birkbeck: 200 Years of Radical Learning for Working\n          People' shows how the University, throughout its history, has had to change both to stay true to\n          our mission and to survive in the face of changes in public policy, social structures and student\n          aspirations.                                                            \n          The University of London Act 2018 made it possible for members of the University of London to\n          apply for university status in their own right, while remaining part of the federation. The granting\n          of university status will not affect such things as the degrees we award, our relationships or\n          contracts, but it enables us to refer to Birkbeck University where we wish to. It is particularly\n          fitting that this status has been formally granted to us in our bicentenary year. The process has\n          been a long one but we finally received our new Royal Charter from the Privy Council in May\n          2023.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck is in the midst of another challenging period of change. In 2020/21 we achieved our\n          highest level of new recruitment for over a decade at over 4,800 FTE. In the two years that\n          followed student recruitment has been significantly lower, in the region of 3,500 FTE. There are\n          reasons specific to Birkbeck and the students it serves behind this shift, but these are set\n          against a backdrop of major volatility in student demand across the whole sector, particularly in\n          London.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          In last year’s report we set out a framework of measures to address this situation for the future.\n          The priority for the Governors this year has been to turn that framework into action, firstly by\n          supporting the debate and consultation necessary to facilitate change, and then to support\n          University management in planning and implementing that change. In the Vice-Chancellor’s\n          report below, you will hear in more detail about the progress we have made in this process, and I\n          stress that it is very much a process. There is more still to do and more still to achieve.\n                                                                                  \n          This has been a critical year for Birkbeck, but also a difficult and pressured one. There has been\n          intense debate about its future direction, shape and organisation amongst the University\n          community but also well beyond it. Birkbeck connects with people, organisations, and fellow\n          higher education institutions directly through our work and, rightly, more broadly through our\n          history, mission and values. In one sense we are a small institution; in other senses we are not\n          and the issues we face resonate much further than Bloomsbury. Many have expressed views and\n          have done so passionately and forthrightly.                             \n          I would like to thank my fellow Governors for their engagement and commitment during a year\n          when there have been serious debates to both listen to, and participate in, and difficult decisions\n          to make. I want to recognise Birkbeck’s Senior Management Team not only for their work during\n          the year but the way that work is so clearly founded on a collective loyalty and deep-rooted belief\n          in the University. Finally, I want to thank the Birkbeck community as a whole. Making change\n          happen has been the work of many, not just a few, and the immediate realities are experienced\n          directly by everyone, especially when what we are doing is driven by imperatives of time and\n          finances. Inevitably, change will be subject to question; what has never been in question is the\n          commitment and dedication of our staff.                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

I thank him for guiding us\n          through what have been turbulent times for higher education and for staying faithful to our\n          founding principles.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          The appointment of the Vice-Chancellor is key to the overall leadership of the University, both\n          directly through their role as chief executive and far more generally; their style of leadership and\n          management sets the tone for the broader culture of leadership, management and engagement\n          across the institution. In this context, in August the Governors were pleased to announce the\n          appointment of Professor Sally Wheeler, OBE as our new Vice-Chancellor, who will take up her\n          new post on 1st January 2024.                                           \n          Professor Wheeler is currently Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International and Corporate) at the\n          Australian National University. She has nearly 30 years of experience in higher education\n          management, encompassing leadership of both research and education at the highest levels.\n          She has made significant contributions to institutional change and development in all these\n          roles. She is strongly aligned to our values and our culture, having taught here earlier in her\n          career.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Professor Wheeler will join Birkbeck as it advances into its third Century - a time of ongoing\n          challenge but also significant future opportunity. As Vice-Chancellor, she will lead, support and\n          work with the whole Birkbeck community. Sally will be driving forward the change needed to\n          secure our future; to provide the platform for financial stability, growth and confidence; and to\n          ensure that we continue to deliver on our core mission.

Our students face the reality of\n          competing priorities and calls on their time. From 18 to 61+ (nearly 300 of our students were\n          over 61 in 2022/23), they are living their lives with all the commitments that entails. Often, they\n          are working, have caring or other responsibilities. Our job is to make sure that in doing all that,\n          they can benefit from higher education, not miss out on it.             \n          Our student body is diverse with 44% from ethnic minority backgrounds and 57% women in\n          2022/23.

Following a high point in 2020/21 when new\n          admissions totalled 4,819 FTE, 2021/22 saw recruitment at a significantly lower level: 3,493\n          FTE. In 2023, whilst new admissions did not decline further, they did not increase and totalled\n          3,500 FTE. In the main this was due to strong contributions from our international recruitment\n          efforts and the significant expansion of our January Start programmes.  \n                                                                                  \n          A very clear part of our strategy post-Brexit has been to focus on, and significantly increase,\n          international recruitment. Thus, it was encouraging to see significant progress here in 2022/23.\n          International recruitment was up significantly from 706 FTE in 2021/22 to 1,070 FTE in\n          2022/23, leading to our highest ever number of international students. As well as growth at\n          postgraduate Masters level where international recruitment has been previously concentrated we\n          had an increased cohort of international undergraduates as well. Our expanded offer of\n          programmes starting in January and providing an alternative entry point are also proving\n          attractive and a positive addition to our course portfolio. We recruited 324 FTE to these\n          programmes in 2022/23 compared to 155 FTE the year before.              \n          The nationwide downturn in the number of adult learners and part-timers entering higher\n          education later in life has continued at undergraduate as well as postgraduate level and the\n          trends and factors underlying that continue to play out. The long-term downward trend resulting\n          from poor maintenance support and older students’ aversion to the debt associated with higher\n          fees has been amplified by post-Covid factors and the extended timescale for the implementation\n          of the Lifelong Learning Entitlement. New and emerging patterns of work in London and across\n          the UK, as well as immediate and challenging economic circumstances. are determining the way\n          mature learners want to study and, just as importantly, their capacity to commit to study now.\n                                                                                  \n          The indications from the 2023/24 recruitment cycle, are that building back recruitment will be\n          the work of a number of years, not one or two. The current issues across the sector in relation to\n          international student recruitment are a reminder of the volatility and risk in the international\n          market and that that there is no single quick fix to be relied on.      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 11",

We need to, and are, shifting perspectives\n          and challenging thinking that is rooted in the circumstances of the past, not directed to the\n          future.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck students are often thought of in terms of their age, but the fact that we have over many\n          years recruited, for example, undergraduates later in life, is a reflection of the opportunities, or\n          rather lack of them in the broader higher education landscape and the consequent life choices\n          our students have taken in response. Things change. Birkbeck students, or rather the students\n          Birkbeck exists to serve, are not ultimately defined by age; they are defined by the circumstances\n          and the struggles they face, the ambition they have, and their commitment to achieve it. Whether\n          18, 28, or 38, we will find them. We need to attract them with the compelling study offer that\n          fulfils that ambition, matches that commitment and fits with those circumstances.\n          Current operating position                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The 2022/23 total comprehensive income for the year was £1.9 million. This compares to a\n          comprehensive expenditure of £10.8 million in the previous year. The outturn itself and how it\n          relates to last year is impacted significantly by changes in the USS pension liability, by changes to\n          severance costs and by the impact of property disposals last year. 2022/23 saw an £8.2 million\n          reduction in our share of the USS liability, compared to an increase in the liability of £20.4 million\n          the year before. Severance costs this year were £3.9 million, up by £1.4 million, reflecting the\n          significant work undertaken on reducing staff costs during 2022/23. The prior year figures also\n          included the £13.9 million profit on the sale of our property Egmont House, which was surplus to\n          requirements following a reconfiguration of our estate to support agile working for our\n          professional services staff.                                            \n                                                                                  \n          Our underlying operating deficit for 2022/23 was £2.2 million (2021/22: underlying deficit of\n          £0.5 million) which reflects the ongoing impact of the significant fall in student numbers in\n          2021/22 and the repeat of recruitment at that lower level in 2022/23 (see Table 4).\n                                                                                  \n          The impact of our recruitment challenge is magnified by the structural financial issues that are\n          playing out across the sector. Annual increases in staff costs - due to promotions, inflationary\n          increases, increment advancement and pension costs - exceed the inflationary increase in our\n          main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate\n          tuition fees. The continued cap on home undergraduate tuition fees is affecting the whole higher\n          education sector in England. The £9,250 fee is now worth over a third less than it was when it\n          was introduced in 2012 and with inflation running at the current high level the pressure placed\n          on universities to generate an excess of income over expenditure is intense.\n          We have not stood by in the face of these circumstances, however, but taken concerted action\n          wherever we can to improve the position. The deficit is not what we want but it is significantly\n          better in relation to the budget and forecast position with which we started the year. This reflects\n          focussed effort in relation to cost management, particularly in relation to staff costs. We have\n          delivered savings through pay restraint, vacancy management and controls on recruitment. In\n          addition, as well as making savings for the long-term we have been able to make some of those\n          savings earlier during the year. We have worked hard to boost our other income and have\n          benefited from a strong recovery in income linked to the use of our estate and the renting of\n          space. Higher interest rates have improved the return on our investments whilst also contributing\n          to the improved performance of the Universities Superannuation Scheme resulting in lower\n          future contribution rates.                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

Each Faculty is composed of larger Schools\n          (replacing Departments), in total 8, which have brought together disciplines in configurations that\n          support continuing academic breadth whilst ensuring efficient and effective scale.\n          Allied to this, and to the same timescale, we have re-organised the student-facing professional\n          services staff based within our Faculties, moving from a highly generalist, primarily local and\n          departmentally based structure to a Faculty based structure with roles defined specifically\n          around the delivery of teaching, the support of students, and separate roles supporting functional\n          areas such as finance, human resources and governance.                  \n                                                                                  \n          Broad organisational reform has gone hand-in-hand with refreshing and renewing academic\n          leadership and management roles, creating a streamlined and professionalised structure where\n          academic colleagues take on Head of School and Faculty Director positions as substantive roles,\n          supported by appropriate training and professional development. Reform has not stopped there.\n          A remodelled senior management team has been constituted, now operating as the University\n          Executive Board, to provide more focussed leadership for change across the University.\n                                                                                  \n          This set of changes represents the culmination of concerted debate and consultation within the\n          University and outside it. It also represents the hard work of many hands, committed to making it\n          happen to the timescale demanded, to whom the University owes a significant debt of thanks.\n          Whilst there have been considerable challenges on both sides, the University has worked\n          constructively with its recognised Trade Unions - UCU, UNISON and UNITE - throughout this\n          period.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The purpose of the re-organisation was to deliver both a better structure but also significant staff\n          savings within it. We have done so, achieving the £8 million of savings scheduled for 2023/24.\n          £6 million of academic staff savings have been achieved for the 2023/24 financial year and,\n          similarly, £2 million of savings from professional services. Some of these savings were achieved\n          sooner than expected contributing to an improved operating position 2022/23. Whilst this\n          outcome can be simply described, for the University it has been a hard and difficult path to tread.\n          I can report that all the savings were achieved through voluntary means, with no compulsory\n          redundancies. That is important but we have all been confronted with the sobering reality of\n          many long-standing colleagues – colleagues who have contributed much to our community -\n          leaving us during the year. There is no doubt though that these savings are vital to our future and\n          as noted already, they were critical to deliver as soon as practical thereby creating the time to\n          adapt and reposition ourselves in relation to the changes in student demand with which we have\n          been confronted.                                                        \n          Our organisational changes necessarily have delivered significant savings but that categorically is\n          not their only purpose and scope. They lay the foundation for a Birkbeck that can build and take\n          advantage of its opportunities for the future, not just survive in its present. There are some key\n          themes to that transformation. Birkbeck is a small institution and in the current climate there are\n          challenges associated with that. Whilst we cannot compensate for all the disadvantages\n          associated with size we should be able to play to the advantages of smaller scale. Complexity,\n          fragmentation, and operational variation have stood in our way. They have stopped us from being\n          the responsive, agile and innovative place we need to be. The simplification of structure,\n          management, lines of communication and operation are designed to give us back this advantage\n          for the future.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 14",

We have a refreshed and renewed\n          education strategy that sets our clearly the steps, interconnections and complex dependencies\n          that underpin the major change to which we are committing and the journey that involves. In\n          2022/23 we have made progress in the following areas.                   \n                                                                                  \n          In October 2022 Birkbeck was awarded £3 million in capital funding by the Office for Students,\n          (OfS) as joint funding for a programme of linked projects entitled Creating Inclusive Learning\n          (CIL). This project is core to our strategy to invest in and deliver our teaching through a flexible\n          blend of campus and digital experience. The driving force behind this initiative is to give our\n          diverse student community the opportunities they deserve in a form that recognises their\n          changed circumstances and needs.                                        \n          The project has two strands:                                            \n                                                                                  \n            •  HyFlex teaching– adaptation of our classrooms (particularly in relation to IT and AV)\n               enabling students to choose whether they join their classes in-person or join the same\n               class online whilst providing a high-quality interactive learning experience in both modes.\n                                                                                  \n            •  Virtual Reality & Immersive Learning (VRIL) – the use of Virtual Reality in purpose-built\n               spaces to enhance the range and scope of our teaching and support for the longer term.\n               This will deliver genuine innovation through new types of course content and new ways of\n               teaching and interacting with our students.                        \n                                                                                  \n          In 2022/23 the project focused on research, pilot and evaluation work which culminated in the\n          development of a clear specification of the equipment required for high quality HyFlex delivery\n          and an invitation to tender for this work. The pilot work was sufficiently rigorous to enable us to\n          offer a suite of HyFlex pilot programmes for the 2023/24 academic year. \n                                                                                  \n          Alongside our longer-term development of HyFlex – the ability to bring together our physical and\n          virtual classrooms - we have also re-configured a suite of programmes to be ‘flexible masters’. At\n          this point, this means that students can choose to study entirely online, in-person, or a\n          combination of both and separate groups are provided for different learning modes where\n          appropriate. This has proved successful and popular. In 2022/23 21% of our Master’s students\n          were enrolled on these programmes.                                      \n          We have undertaken an extensive portfolio redesign laying the ground work for a move to a more\n          simplified, flexible and attractive mix of undergraduate and postgraduate courses starting from\n          2023/24. We built on the work to digitally transform our virtual learning environment in response\n          to the pandemic to create courses that provide a blend of excellent interactive teaching sessions\n          and the highest quality asynchronous online learning materials available to our diverse body of\n          students 24 hours a day 7 days a week.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Our new pathway system aims to create choice within subject areas in a way which constrains\n          some elements of module choice but creates more coherent programmes, stronger cohorts of\n          students and choice in the flexibility of delivery. This work has also created greater economies of\n          scale, whilst maintaining Birkbeck’s broad academic subject base.       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 15",

Core objectives for the new model\n          address student feedback about preferences for attendance and greater consistency of student\n          experience across subject areas. Students are now taught over three terms and are assessed at\n          the end of the term in which teaching content is taught.

As\n          with evening teaching sessions, day-time study will be supported with rich online learning\n          resources.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Pilots will be run in Business, Management, Law, Psychology and Biomedicine, in the current\n          recruitment cycle and they will be promoted with a clearly segmented marketing campaign.\n          Market analysis indicates that this model should appeal to younger commuter students in\n          Greater London and its immediate hinterland combining study with other commitments and our\n          location and reputation will enable us to take some of this growing cohort from other providers.\n                                                                                  \n          Building our international market. Daytime teaching also gives us the opportunity to change our\n          approach to international recruitment. Cambridge Education Group (CEG) have taught large\n          cohorts of international students on introductory/foundation level programmes on our campus\n          during the day, but these students have tended to move on to other University of London\n          institutions as there has been no natural feed through onto our programmes. A positive\n          relationship built over time around provision of space and services has the potential to deliver\n          much more. We are creating a formal progression agreement that guarantees recognition of CEG\n          qualifications as entry points onto our degrees in cognate areas (Business, Management and\n          Law).                                                                   \n          We are also changing the way we operate with recruitment agents. Alongside our existing\n          approach, we will be trialling a new model for 2024 involving a major largescale recruitment\n          partner with the infrastructure and capacity to support recruitment across multiple regions and\n          markets with targets for a major additional contribution to recruitment. Learning from these\n          tactical changes will allow us to pursue further strategic partnership opportunities both locally\n          and internationally.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          New programmes. We will be launching new programmes across the University in 2024 and\n          2025, bringing together academic creativity with market research. These programmes include\n          new provision in Health and Wellbeing, Business, Data Analytics, Natural Sciences and Social\n          and Political Sciences, which are now open for entry in autumn 2024 with further new initiatives\n          being planned for entry in 2025.                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 16",

We are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and facilities that will enable us to reach\n          new students through HyFlex delivery with teaching simultaneously taking place on campus and\n          online. This innovation means that in our areas of major academic and research strength we will\n          be able to open our cutting-edge Masters provision at distance across the UK, as well as to those\n          able to attend classes in central London.                               \n                                                                                  \n          Developing, rethinking and resizing our estate                          \n          Our starting point for change has once again been to define our strategy, setting out strategic\n          principles.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n          We have committed to create a connected campus clearly focussed on our main Torrington\n          Square site, rationalising our other estate holdings to create the foundation for a future estate\n          that can be sustainable, both environmentally and financially. Linked to our education strategy\n          we will work towards all Birkbeck classes being delivered in Birkbeck classrooms, recognising\n          that to deliver the learning experience we want we need to have tight integration between our\n          physical estate and our digital infrastructure including direct control over both.\n                                                                                  \n          Our aim through development, investment and the co-location of facilities and services is to\n          create a campus environment that supports a transformational student experience alongside\n          modern facilities that underpin the excellence of our research. We will do that by focussing on\n          the development and refurbishment of the adjacent buildings that now run the full length of\n          Torrington Square to the West: Birkbeck Central, the Torrington Square Main Building, and, in the\n          longer-term, the redevelopment of the Main Building extension.          \n                                                                                  \n          We will retain our existing buildings around Torrington Square to the East – the Wohl Wolfson\n          Toddler Lab, the Clore Management Centre, and the Henry Wellcome Building - to support our\n          connected campus, creating a clear Birkbeck presence and identity around the Square.\n                                                                                  \n          In this context we have progressed the identification of options for the location of our teaching,\n          our staff and our key infrastructure and facilities. This is now allowing us to pursue various\n          opportunities for estate asset sales that support both our overall financial position and provide\n          long-term capacity for strategic investment.                            \n          We have continued with our planning for the progressive development of Birkbeck Central as the\n          focus for investment in the student experience.

The\n          University’s first ever comprehensive fundraising and engagement campaign is deepening our\n          relationships with current supporters and attracting new donors to support Birkbeck's ambitions.\n                                                                                  \n          In addition to supporting the University financially, our alumni and friends play an important role\n          in aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives. Last year we continued to\n          see more students benefiting from the support, guidance and advice given by our growing\n          community of valued volunteers. Through flagship volunteering programmes such as Mentoring\n          Pathways, Global Buddies and Career Clinics 460 students benefited from support, guidance and\n          advice given by 351 volunteers, a total of 5,457 hours of time. This included time given by 126\n          corporate volunteers from organisations including Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, PwC, Clifford Chance\n          and the Arts Council England.                                           \n          The post-pandemic economic recovery, global turbulence and ongoing cost-of -living crisis means\n          that many of our students, alumni and donors are facing new challenges and uncertain times\n          ahead. During our 200th Anniversary year, we were proud that our existing community continued\n          to come together to provide vital funding and expertise to ensure that Birkbeck students and\n          researchers continue to have access to the tools, support and services that enable them to thrive\n          and succeed at Birkbeck and beyond.                                     \n                                                                                  \n          As we underwent our strategic organisational review so that the institution could be in a stronger\n          position to thrive as we entered our third century, it was not immune to the uncertainty and\n          impacts associated with any such large-scale change programme. Although existing donor\n          support remained strong, there was inevitably a knock-on effect on the generation of new\n          philanthropic income from individuals, corporates and foundations. However, we are encouraged\n          by the healthy pipeline of future funding support that we have identified which will enable us to\n          return to our previous funding levels.                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 19",

Organised by the alumni engagement team,\n          hundreds of alumni, staff, students and friends attended the first four of our 200th Anniversary\n          Leadership lecture series in person and online. Covering a range of topical issues aligned with\n          our founding mission, the series has included: ‘Creating a More Equitable Tech Sector’, a panel\n          discussion chaired by Birkbeck Governor Rachel Neaman with senior representatives from\n          Google and Meta; and an inspirational lecture on ‘The Dramaturgy of Leadership’ by actor and\n          playwright, Kwame Kwei-Armah. The Anniversary Lectures have been complemented by a series\n          of alumni celebratory gatherings in fifteen cities across the globe and those organised by several\n          departments to mark this special year in Birkbeck’s history.            \n          Gender pay gap                                                          \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to\n          operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which\n          rewards staff in line with the University commitment to equality and diversity.

All schemes formally take account of personal\n          circumstances, and all committee members undertake both formal Equality & Diversity and\n          unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is reviewed annually by Birkbeck for equality &\n          diversity issues in application and success rates.                      \n                                                                                  \n          74% of bonus payments made in 2022 were staff contributions directly related to the COVID\n          pandemic. Therefore, the figures for this period are not a true reflection of year-on-year trends.\n                                                                                  \n          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in\n          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal\n          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the\n          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted\n          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena\n          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances.\n                                                                                  \n          Although the vertical gender pay gap remains 2022 saw another small shift towards greater\n          gender equality. For the top quartile in 2020 46.8% of staff were female. This increased to 48.9%\n          in March 2021 and 49.3% in 2022.                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 21",

Facility time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the\n          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when\n          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open\n          and transparent monitoring of this.

The principal activities undertaken by the University\n          are teaching and research together with ancillary activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional\n          activities include rendering academic services to a variety of educational, commercial and other\n          organisations.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of\n          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in\n          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard\n          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and,\n          therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The Financial\n          Statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the\n          revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).      \n          The completion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, global recovery from the\n          effects of the pandemic, geopolitical events and increases in inflation have had a significant\n          effect on families, businesses, and economies in the last few years. Despite a swift and\n          successful move to on-line learning during lockdown student numbers fell significantly in\n          2021/22 and have not recovered since. This has led to direct and indirect financial\n          consequences for Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.\n                                                                                  \n          Although we need to rapidly address a financial position where costs exceed income we are not\n          alone in the UK HE sector. Government regulated tuition fees for Home undergraduate students\n          remain fixed at £9,250 despite rapidly rising costs. The erosion in value of the fee that can be\n          charged is placing considerable strain on the budgets of all universities in England. This Financial\n          Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial impact of pension and\n          other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive Income & Expenditure\n          and Statement of Financial Position.                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Results for the Year                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Chart 3 compares the main income streams for the last five years whilst Chart 4 summarises the\n          total income for 2022/23.                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 24",

Teaching grant now represents only 2.1% of total income in comparison with\n          47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to\n          62.2% in 2022/23. Tuition income fell by £2.5 million this year on top of an £8.4 million fall in\n          2021/22. 2020/21 saw a spike in applications from EU students wishing to benefit from the\n          final year of UK government tuition fee loans and this increase was replaced by a significant\n          reduction the following year as EU students had to pay their own fees – an outcome seen across\n          the sector not just at Birkbeck. The fall in new student numbers between 2020/21 and 2021/22\n          has a knock-on effect on future years as larger graduating cohorts of undergraduates are\n          replaced by lower incoming groups of students. Whilst incoming student numbers were similar in\n          2021/22 and 2022/23 the numbers of returners fell by around 650 due to the cohort effect.\n          Recurrent grant from Research England rose by £1.2 million (10.9%) primarily due to additional\n          non-recurrent grant funding to help offset the negative impact of not being associated with\n          Horizon Europe. We are pleased that UK universities are once again able to collaborate with\n          partners under the programme following the announcement that agreement had been reached in\n          September 2023. Externally funded research activity returned to pre-pandemic levels as\n          restrictions on movement (and, therefore, research activity) were relaxed post-Covid. Overall, the\n          total amount of grant and fee income remained similar this year (a net fall of £71,000).\n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck primarily provides teaching to its students in the evening and rents much of its space to\n          other universities during the daytime. With lockdown and ongoing safety restrictions limiting the\n          activities which could take place on campus, other income was depressed during 2020/21 with\n          a partial recovery in 2021/22. Income from lettings, catering and conferences rose by a further\n          £1.8 million in 2022/23 (2021/22: a rise of £2.0 million) almost returning to pre-pandemic\n          levels.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Increasing interest rates from recent historic lows has had a positive impact on investment\n          income which increased by £0.9 million this year. Rates are expected to fall slowly over the\n          coming years. Governors agreed a new investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support\n          our core business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our\n          estates strategy. £10.0 million was invested in two externally managed funds with strong\n          Environmental, Social and Governance criteria embedded in investment decision making. Both\n          funds performed remarkably well and In November 2021 combined gains of £4.0 million were\n          realised and converted into cash with both funds reset to £10.0 million. Equity values have\n          subsequently fallen with an unrealised loss on investments of £0.3 million (2021/22: unrealised\n          gain of £0.3 million) being recorded.                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 26",

*Undergraduate degree with a foundation year studied in a full-time mode\n          The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since the government increased the\n          maximum fee which universities could charge to Home undergraduates to £9,000 in 2012\n          appeared to have plateaued but further falls have now been experienced in the last two years.\n          We are pleased that the Lifelong Learning Entitlement (previously Lifelong Loan Entitlement) is\n          scheduled to be introduced from 2025 albeit with a phased approach to modular delivery. We\n          are generally supportive of measures aimed at relaxing the apprenticeship levy criteria thereby\n          enabling businesses to support a wider range of skills training through part-time and short\n          courses. It is clear that re-skilling and up-skilling of the UK workforce in key areas is a core part of\n          both national and local government strategies and we will be developing new programmes and\n          modes of delivery to further support the ambitions of part time students.\n          Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this\n          occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown\n          restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters\n          programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to\n          upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-\n          Brexit) recovery. This increase was reversed in 2021/22 in part due to positive employment rates\n          in London and the cost pressures of high inflation. International students drove an increase in\n          full time postgraduate enrolments whilst Home enrolments studying full and part-time fell further.",

Income\n          from part-time students fell by £3.5 million following the fall of £4.2 million in 2021/22.\n                                                                                  \n          We have seen a continuing upward trend in the number of students looking to complete a\n          foundation year before progressing on to year one of a degree programme. Many of our students\n          return to study later in life and often did not achieve A-levels or equivalent earlier in life. We were\n          extremely disappointed when the Government announced that from 2025/26 the maximum fee\n          allowable for foundation year provision would be £5,670 rather than £9,250. We believe that the\n          foundation year is critical from an equality perspective and remain committed to delivering the\n          programmes. This fee reduction, coupled with the continuing freeze in the maximum fee we are\n          able to charge undergraduate Home students, will deepen the funding gap between the cost of\n          teaching a student and the fee received with an inevitable impact on the services we wish to\n          provide. This financial challenge is being faced by all universities and is unsustainable for a\n          sector which is fundamental to the success of the UK and its economy.   \n          Charts 6 and 7 summarise where our expenditure has been incurred.       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               80.0                                                               \n                                                                                  \n               70.0                                                               \n               60.0                                                               \n               50.0                                                               \n                                                                                  \n               40.0                                                               \n               30.0                                                               \n                                                                                  \n               20.0                                                               \n               10.0                                                               \n                0.0                                                               \n                                Admin &                                           \n                    Academic and                   Research grants                \n                               professional Other expenses     Premises           \n                    related services                & contracts                   \n                                services                                          \n              2018/19  68.6      21.7       1.9       7.1       14.8              \n              2019/20  64.0      18.4       1.6       6.8       14.2              \n              2020/21  66.5      21.7       0.8       6.7       11.2              \n              2021/22  70.2      22.7       0.2       7.3       11.0              \n              2022/23  75.1      22.5       1.2       7.1       11.8              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 28                                     \n            )m£(                                                                  \n            erutidnepxe                                                           \n            latoT                                                                 \n                 Total staff costs and other expenses (excluding                  \n                          pension  provision) by activity                         \n          Chart 6: Expenditure by activity 2018/19 to 2022/23",

Over the same five-year time\n          period administrative and professional costs have been kept at broadly the same level only\n          increasing by £1.7 million (now representing 20.8% of expenditure compared with 18.2% in\n          2018/19).                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          The ratio of staff costs to total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and\n          restructuring costs) is a helpful metric to review when considering financial sustainability. In\n          general, restructuring costs should be included in this metric but are excluded from Table 3\n          allowing for better year-on-year comparison. The University does not own any student residences\n          (which increase income without a corresponding material increase in staff costs) so this\n          percentage remains one of the highest in the sector.                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 29",

A post-Brexit referendum fall in students enrolling\n          from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 8\n          and directly led to the underlying deficit in 2018/19. We saw a significant switch in 2020/21 due\n          to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition income and a surplus was delivered. Unfortunately,\n          the fall in new student enrolments in 2021/22 immediately reversed the trend – a trend which\n          has continued into 2022/23.                                             \n          Chart 8 graphically illustrates the financial challenge the University faces: with a heavy reliance\n          on tuition income, and an inability to increase the Home undergraduate fee, the University must\n          increase student numbers each year to offset cost inflation. With such a high percentage of our\n          costs currently invested in our staff we are unable to quickly adapt our cost base to a reduction in\n          our primary income stream. Following the recent fall in student numbers and income we had no\n          choice but to develop plans to reduce our staff establishment. The first phase of this difficult\n          process was completed in 2022/23 with £9.0 million of staff cost savings identified through a\n          combination of voluntary severance, early retirement and vacancy management. The full year\n          effect of the savings will be felt in 2023/24 although vacancy management delivered an in-year\n          variance against budget of around £3.0 million. Restructuring costs of £3.9 million were required\n          to deliver the staff savings.                                           \n                                                                                  \n          Unlike a number of universities, we continue to apply the sector pay award in full when it is\n          announced. This included the early payment in 2022/23 of part of the 2023/24 award which\n          added an additional £0.6 million in unbudgeted staff costs. We also remain committed to paying\n          the London Living Wage from the first day of the month following the announcement of any\n          increase.                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2020 with the effect\n          that the scheme deficit increased. Employee benefits were reduced and a repayment plan was\n          agreed in 2021/22. This deficit recovery plan increased our share of the pension liability by\n          £20.3 million with a corresponding reduction to the comprehensive income for the year. At 31\n          July 2023 the assumptions which underpin the calculation of the pension liability had improved\n          with our share of the liability estimated to fall to £29.0 million – resulting in a corresponding\n          increase in comprehensive income for the year of £8.2 million. The instability of the scheme over\n          recent years and the impact on contribution rates is highlighted in Table 3a.\n           Contribution rates 2011 - Apr 16 - Apr 19 - Oct 19 - Oct 21 - Apr 22 - Likely\n                          Mar 16 Mar 19 Sep 19 Sep 21 Mar 22 Mar 24 Jan 24        \n                                                                                  \n           Members         6.5%   8.0%   8.8%   9.6%   9.8%   9.8%  6.1%          \n           Employers       16.0% 18.0%  19.5%  21.1%  21.4%  21.6%  14.5%         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Table 3a: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)     \n                                                                                  \n          As can be seen from Table 3a, the Universities Superannuation Scheme has become more costly\n          over time with the University contribution rate 35% higher in 2022/23 than it was in early 2016.\n          Additional covenant support was provided to USS by employers and benefits to members were\n          reduced to ensure that the 2020 valuation was concluded without unaffordable increases in\n          contributions being enforced.                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 31",

They are also mindful of\n          the fact that around 20% of eligible staff nationally have chosen not to be members of USS with\n          many citing that the contribution rates are unaffordable. The positive outcome of the 2023\n          valuation should introduce a period of stability for all and we remain supportive of plans to\n          develop alternate, flexible pension options for staff within USS.       \n                                                                                  \n          Non-staff cost budgets were reduced in autumn 2022 when we realised that student recruitment\n          would remain flat and budget managers adapted and carefully monitored their spend plans\n          identifying further savings throughout the year. The provision for doubtful debts provides an\n          assessment at the end of each year as to the proportion of student related debt which may be\n          unlikely to be recovered. The provision increased by £1.0 million over 2021/22 to £4.3 million\n          almost certainly as a consequence of the challenge many of our students are facing as inflation\n          and interest rates have risen significantly. Although this will impact all students in the UK our\n          more mature students are also likely to have mortgages and family costs to manage.\n          International students, particularly those from our core market in Nigeria, may have seen a\n          significant reduction in the value of their local currency against Sterling making the cost of\n          studying in the UK more expensive. The University was protected from the significant increases in\n          energy costs of the last couple of years having entered a fixed price contract. This contract ended\n          in autumn 2023 and a rise of around £1.0 million is expected in 2023/24. Although other\n          operating expenses rose by £1.8 million compared with 2021/22 this represented a saving\n          against the revised budget of £1.0 million.                             \n          During the year we decided to terminate a loan facility we had arranged in 2020/21. Due to the\n          fall in student numbers we agreed to pause and review our estates strategy determining that\n          until our underlying financial position improved we will be unlikely to undertake large scale\n          improvements to our assets and infrastructure. The loan facility was undrawn with only a\n          commitment fee being incurred each year (part-year cost in 2022/23 £11,000).\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 32",

National and\n          global circumstances have adversely affected international recruitment at all institutions and we\n          have been no exception. In particular, the economic and currency situation in specific regions,\n          the policy stance taken over the summer by the Government on post study work visas and\n          dependents rules, and the extended UKVI processing issues, have all contributed to a sector\n          wide drop in conversion. Our application to enrolment conversion rate for international applicants\n          has fallen this year from 5-6% to 4%.                                   \n          Similarly, sector trends have affected recruitment from the Home market where cost of living\n          challenges and low unemployment rates are impacting on the mature postgraduate market in\n          particular. Despite an increase in the number of school leavers the HE participation rate in this\n          group has fallen for a second year. With Home undergraduate fees remaining fixed once again by\n          the UK Government, the reducing real value of income from Home undergraduate students has\n          required universities to increasingly look to grow the number of Home postgraduate and\n          international students.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Each year, staff costs increase due to the national pay award, incremental drift and promotions.\n          Whilst the expected fall in contributions to USS are welcome the fixed unit of resource from\n          Home undergraduate students requires student number growth simply to meet the inflationary\n          increase in staff costs. Not only do we need to reduce costs quickly to manage the fall in student\n          numbers but the challenge of managing rising costs with a fixed annual income is a cycle we\n          must break.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n          To deliver this objective we identified £9.0 million of staff savings during the year with further\n          savings to be identified from central professional services during 2023/24. Identifying staff\n          savings as soon as practical was critical (albeit very difficult for the University community) as it\n          extended the time we now have to focus on the delivery of new academic programmes to deliver\n          growth in income. Had we delayed identifying savings and tried to deliver growth first we would\n          have been in a difficult financial position given the external impacts on recruitment.\n          With income growth now the priority we have created two new committees to identify\n          opportunities, develop plans for delivery and oversee performance. The Academic Growth\n          Steering Group is Chaired by a new Pro Vice Chancellor for Academic Projects and is\n          concentrating on additional programmes, subject areas and modes of delivery at both\n          undergraduate and postgraduate level. The Innovation & Commercialisation Board is tasked with\n          identifying third stream income projects. Both committees report through to the University\n          Executive Board which is tasked with ensuring that our income growth targets are met over the\n          coming years.                                                           \n                                                                                  \n          Although we posted an underlying deficit for the second year running, with a budget deficit also\n          forecast for 2023/24, we are confident that we will be able to increase income over the next few\n          years whilst also keeping costs down. We do not have any loans so are not pressured by financial\n          covenants during a period of recovery. Total cash plus investments fell by £2.7 million but\n          remains at a relatively healthy balance of £49.6 million at the year end. The cash reserves\n          provide a buffer which will allow us a period of time to turn the deficits around. Although income\n          growth is essential for the University to return to a break even position a review of downside\n          scenarios (including a no growth scenario) indicates that the University remains a going concern.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 34",

We provided a full compliance statement on internal control last year and\n          will continue to do so.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The internal auditor confirmed significant assurance with minor improvement opportunities on\n          the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Birkbeck’s framework of governance, risk\n          management and control in 2021/22. The internal auditor also reviewed risk management\n          practices at the School and Department level as part a review of devolved controls and found\n          that action was needed to ensure completeness and recording of risk management locally.\n          Implementing this recommendation was deferred during the transition to the new academic\n          structure and is being taken forward by the new Faculties in 2023/24.   \n          The University Risk Management Policy explains the underlying approach to risk management\n          and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit Committee,\n          University management groups and other key parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk\n          management process and identifies the main reporting procedures. The University has reviewed\n          its approach to risk management to strengthen risk ownership and to improve Birkbeck’s ability\n          to identify and assess significant risks and respond to them quickly and effectively. It has been\n          making regular reports on this to Audit Committee.                      \n                                                                                  \n          The top-level Risk Register is compiled by senior management and overseen by a Risk\n          Management Group comprising the principal risk owners. Each risk owner is responsible for a\n          risk register for their risk area in which current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. Governance and oversight for\n          each risk area is provided by the relevant University committee or management group. The risks\n          are monitored by Audit Committee and Governors.                         \n                                                                                  \n          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved\n          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  \n          The top risks are reduced student income leading to a position where costs exceed income. The\n          financial risk escalated due to lower student numbers in recent years coupled with inflation at an\n          historic high level in 2023. The underlying risk factors plus the actions taken and to be taken to\n          mitigate the risks have been discussed in this Strategic Review. Although the University is\n          forecasting underlying financial deficits for the next few years as it looks to recover student\n          numbers we have modelled the impact of not achieving or partially achieving our plans. A\n          downside stress test indicates that we will remain solvent but liquidity could become an issue.\n          Monthly cash flow reports and management accounts are prepared and reviewed by\n          management to help with early identification of emerging risks.         \n                                                                                  \n          Our Estates and IT teams have developed detailed risk registers for their areas of responsibility\n          this year which have been reviewed termly by the Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committee\n          and Digital subcommittee respectively. Monthly e-learning modules covering various aspects of IT\n          and data security have been released to staff throughout the year with uptake reported to the\n          Strategic Planning Committee. Audit Committee has also overseen other improvements in\n          compliance with data protection legislation and in managing IT security risk. Cybersecurity is\n          likely to remain a significant risk indefinitely due to the adaptability of those looking to breach\n          security arrangements.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 35",

Weekly meetings of the change management project group led by the Deputy\n          Vice-Chancellor and supported by a dedicated professional project management team ensure\n          appropriate progress was made. The Governors increased the frequency of their meetings to\n          ensure effective oversight, and the Chairs of the Governors’ committees met regularly with senior\n          management to discuss progress. As a result, the new academic structure was implemented as\n          planned on 1 August 2023. A transition group has now been formed to deal with any emerging\n          operational matters which may arise.                                    \n          Public Benefit Statement                                                \n                                                                                  \n          The University Charter updated 25 May 2023 states:                      \n                                                                                  \n          “The objects of Birkbeck shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons who\n          are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,\n          instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in\n          subjects determined by the Governors, advised by the Academic Board.”   \n                                                                                  \n          As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are\n          required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public.

This means to promote, sustain and\n          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills\n          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including\n          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and\n          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual\n          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   \n          The Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins everything\n          we do.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in\n          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in\n          the Charities Act.

The\n          pandemic depressed the amount of research activity that could be undertaken in the latter part\n          of 2019/20 and most of 2020/21 leading to a fall in income recognised. Work has now returned\n          to normal with a corresponding increase in income. The University currently has a portfolio of live\n          research projects representing in excess of £50 million in external grant funding.\n                                                                                  \n          Whilst our core mission underpins the advancement of education this in turn can have a\n          profound impact on wider public benefits.                               \n          The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many\n          disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material\n          resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor\n          health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”\n          It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are\n          concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes\n          (prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission\n          contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also\n          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.\n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to\n          educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who\n          may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for\n          mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through\n          our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution\n          and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented\n          groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without\n          strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily\n          increasing to 960 FTE in 2022/23 (see Chart 6). During 2022/23 44% of our students are from\n          ethnic minority backgrounds (2021:22: 41%), 42% male (2021/22: 42%), 24% declaring a\n          disability (2021/22: 23%) and 64% over the age of 25 (2021/22: 65%). We are proud to offer an\n          opportunity to groups of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and remain\n          committed to driving this agenda in the higher education sector.        \n          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students\n          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from\n          ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 97%\n          of our part-time students (2021/22: 97%) and 73% of full-time students (2021/22: 75%) are\n          over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who wish to combine evening university teaching\n          with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be\n          able to study. Over recent years we have seen a steady increase in the number of full time\n          undergraduates aged 21 or under choosing to study at Birkbeck suggesting the ability to mix\n          education and work is increasingly attractive to younger students.      \n                                                                                  \n          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have\n          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that\n          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes\n          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time\n          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and\n          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to\n          continue with our current approach on access.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 37",

These critical life factors inevitably\n          challenge our students and this is reflected in our continuation rates. Through the pandemic, the\n          move to on-line was welcomed as it enabled our students to study when time allowed. Since the\n          pandemic, hybrid working has become the norm for many workers who no longer need to travel\n          to the capital five days a week. To ensure that working students with other life priorities can\n          continue to engage with higher education and succeed we are moving all our programmes\n          towards HyFlex delivery. This change in pedagogy will be facilitated by upgrades to the AV and IT\n          of all classrooms across our estate over the next three years.

Internal audit monitors the progress\n          made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure that they are addressed\n          in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the Audit Committee.\n                                                                                  \n          Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:\n                                                                                  \n            •  the financial statements of the University give a true and fair picture of the state of its\n               affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cashflow for the financial\n               year;                                                              \n            •  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting\n               standards including the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction;   \n            •  external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those\n               purposes and managed appropriately; and                            \n            •  income has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions from both the\n               Office for Students and Research England.                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,     \n          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Opinion on the financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n          In our opinion, the financial statements:                               \n                                                                                  \n            •  give a true and fair view of the state of the University’s affairs as at 31 July 2023 and of\n               the University’s income and expenditure, gains and losses, changes in reserves and the\n               University’s cash flows for the year then ended; and               \n            •  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted\n               Accounting Practice.                                               \n                                                                                  \n          We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the University”) for\n          the year ended 31 July 2023 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income and\n          Expenditure, Statement of Changes in Reserves, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of\n          Cash Flows, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting\n          policies.

The extent to which our procedures are\n          capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below: \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 46",

Basis of preparation                                                \n                                                                                    \n                These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended\n                Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial\n                Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of\n                Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit\n                requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost\n                convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).\n                The University's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and\n                position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.\n                Going Concern                                                       \n                The impact of lower student income following Brexit, increased competition across London and external\n                factors impacting international recruitment, together with historic high rates of inflation, have significantly\n                impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases\n                and increment advancement) exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due\n                to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of\n                5% of income eroded but we now need to implement a recovery plan to move from a period of actual and\n                forecast deficits back into a sustainable financial position.       \n                In November 2021, the University endorsed a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26. The strategy is\n                focussed on the difficult challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as well as the lessons learnt and\n                strides taken forward in responding to it. The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental\n                challenges for the University. In particular, financial sustainability, the ability to maintain research\n                intensity, market position and teaching competitiveness. Repositioning will involve a fundamental revision\n                of our underlying operational and teaching delivery models, creating the greater degree of standardisation\n                in mode of teaching delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and\n                support student success. Addressing competitiveness will also involve the major efficiency gains that are\n                necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.           \n                With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23 and lower\n                recruitment once again in 2023/24, Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges which confirm the\n                importance of this strategic change but which makes its rapid realisation also essential. In terms of the\n                immediate financial challenges linked to student recruitment we have been working closely with\n                Governors to confirm the immediate steps in our recovery plan and during 2022/23 Governors agreed the\n                following key actions:                                              \n              - a reduction in staff costs of £12 million over two years to bring costs back into alignment with reduced\n                tuition income;                                                     \n              - increased income totalling £15 million by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new modes of\n                delivery (including HyFlex), rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes\n                more attractive, plus some additional third-stream income; and      \n              - a reduction in the size of our estate. Having purchased the building adjacent to our main campus site as\n                part of our strategy to provide improved learning and teaching facilities for our staff and students, we are\n                in a position to dispose of estate assets that are less suited to our future needs.\n                Significant progress was made during the year such that we delivered £9 million of staff savings for the\n                start of 2023/24 - £1m ahead of the phased target. In addition, around £3 million of savings were\n                achieved early during 2022/23 helping us to deliver a much improved financial position (albeit still an\n                underlying deficit of £2.2 million) against budget. Reducing our staff costs quickly has provided sufficient\n                financial headroom to allow us to now focus on delivering income recovery plans over the next few years.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                        Page 53",

Although the base-case scenario predicts underlying deficits for the next\n                few years as we build new programmes and deliver education via new modes of delivery the forecasts\n                indicate that cash reserves will be maintained. Even under a downside scenario where no income\n                recovery is possible we remain solvent and have sufficient time to undertake further mitigating actions.\n                Governors have reviewed the financial forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and\n                medium term recovery strategy and the risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges\n                resulting from the drop in student numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the University has\n                adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, we continue\n                to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.\n           2.

Income recognition                                                  \n                Tuition fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the\n                Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.\n                Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is\n                shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not\n                deducted from income.                                               \n                Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when\n                the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms of the contract has been\n                satisfied.                                                          \n                Investment income is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a receivable basis.\n                Grant funding                                                       \n                Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and UKRI research and research grants, are\n                recognised as income over the periods in which the University recognises the related costs for which the\n                grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as\n                deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more\n                than one year as appropriate.                                       \n                Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the\n                University is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received\n                in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors\n                and released to income as the conditions are met.                   \n                Donations and endowments                                            \n                                                                                    \n                Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and\n                endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income\n                when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is utilised\n                in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                         Page 54",

Accounting for retirement benefits                                  \n                University staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme\n                (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are\n                primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by\n                professionally qualified independent actuaries.                     \n                Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities\n                of the University due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined\n                contribution retirement benefit schemes.                            \n                A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the\n                schemes.                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                Defined contribution plan                                           \n                A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed\n                contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further\n                amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an\n                expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                Defined benefit plan                                                \n                                                                                    \n                Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n                defined benefit plans, the university’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n                employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n                returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n                the university. The university should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net\n                of plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n                employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to\n                determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed\n                by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n                recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the university is able to recover the surplus either\n                through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 55",

Large value\n                software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial\n                phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8\n                years.                                                              \n                Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the\n                Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for\n                capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then\n                such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes\n                available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the\n                useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.\n           13.

It is, therefore,\n                a charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the\n                University is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within\n                categories covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the\n                Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively\n                charitable purposes.                                                \n                The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is\n                included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their\n                cost.                                                               \n           17.  Reserves                                                            \n                Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances\n                which, through endowment to the University, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the\n                university must hold in perpetuity.                                 \n                Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,\n                therefore, the University is restricted in the use of these funds.  \n                                                                                    \n           18.  Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n                Management considers that certain accounting estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, debtors,\n                fixed assets and provisions are its critical accounting estimates.  \n                In preparing these financial statements the University has made the following judgements:\n              a) Pension provisions include key assumptions on discount rates, salary inflation and staff numbers in the\n                future. As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is\n                recognised as a liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan\n                agreed in the 2020 actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of\n                future salaries between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each\n                triennial valuation of the scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future\n                salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out\n                in note 26.                                                         \n              b) The holiday pay provision is calculated using a sample of departments within the university.\n              c) A general provision for bad and doubtful debts is calculated using a formula based on the age of the\n                overdue debt. The formula is applied consistently each year but necessarily requires a degree of\n                estimation. A specific provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for individual debts where recovery is\n                believed to be uncertain and this requires an element of judgement. \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 58",

The University’s\n              strategic activity included progress in developing and delivering a project to improve how will be able to\n              monitor student engagement and thus support our students in their learning. We established an\n              implementation plan to address the awarding gap in the performance between our Black and White students.\n              Finally, we completed the portfolio review commenced in 2021-22, restructuring the teaching model to\n              simplify and standardise the approach so students will be taught across three terms, in manageable module\n              sizes with regular feedback. The new programmes will commence in autumn 2023.\n              The Access and Engagement Team continued to deliver programmes to support young people in further\n              education, mature learner engagement and embarked on work to start delivering new objectives in the\n              Access and Participation Plan from 2023-24 and its spend was on target within the year.\n              The University purposefully reduced its overall expenditure on individual student bursaries as agreed with the\n              OfS, recognising that investment in institutional approaches, such as the student engagement programme\n              would provide benefit to a greater number of students. Investment to support disabled students, including\n              learning support, increased (with additional investment in mental health services and study support)\n              significantly this year. Research and evaluation investment remained as planned (marginally under target\n              owing to staff changes), with further support (and a dedicated staff role) secured for 2023-24 onwards.\n              The 2020/21 - 2024-25 Access and Participation Plan can be found here:\n                                                                                    \n              https://accessandparticipationplans.officeforstudents.org.uk/accessplansdownloads/2024/BirkbeckCollege\n              _APP_2020-21_V2_10007760.pdf                                          \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 65",

The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,\n              providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the\n              scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the\n              assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution\n              is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify\n              its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As\n              required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as\n              if it were a wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account\n              represents the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the\n              Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the\n              institution recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that\n              they relate to the deficit) with the related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.\n              FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of\n              a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme\n              is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such\n              as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer\n              has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results\n              in the recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that\n              they relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.\n              University Governors are satisfied that the Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a\n              multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual\n              contributions under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n              The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2020 (the\n              valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method.\n                                                                                    \n              Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the\n              following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 76",

The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to have\n              sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the\n              assets of the scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £80.6 billion\n              indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.   \n              In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the university currently recognises a provision for its\n              obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).\n              The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below.

The\n              2022 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan.                   \n              The latest triennial valuation was undertaken as at 31 March 2023 and determined that movements in\n              valuation assumptions had improved the position significantly such that the scheme deficit of £14.1 billion\n              assessed at 31 March 2020 had changed to a surplus of £7.4 billion at 31 March 2023. Although unlikely to\n              be formally approved before the date of signing these Financial Statements it is likely that contribution rates\n              will fall significantly whilst benefits will also be restored to those in place prior to the 2020 valuation. Our\n              share of the scheme liability will be reversed in 2023/24 once the 2023 USS valuation has been formally\n              approved.                                                             \n              Employer and employee contribution rates for the scheme during the last three years were:\n                                                Employer    Employee                \n              From April 2022                     21.6%        9.8%                 \n              October 2021 - March 2022           21.4%        9.8%                 \n              October 2019 - September 2021       21.1%        9.6%                 \n              April - September 2019              19.5%        8.8%                 \n              (ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)\n                                                                                    \n              General description of the Pension Scheme                             \n                                                                                    \n              Birkbeck participates in the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (\"SAUL\"), which is a\n              centralised defined benefit scheme within the United Kingdom and was contracted out of the Second State\n              Pension (prior to April 2016).                                        \n              SAUL is an independently-managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and\n              institutions with links to higher education.                          \n              Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings (\"CARE\")\n              basis.                                                                \n              On 1 April SAUL introduced SAUL Start, a defined contribution scheme.

The Trustee adopts\n              assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits\n              already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued\n              pension rights to be met.                                             \n              The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events turning\n              out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove the risk\n              that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.\n              A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and\n              independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2020.\n              Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new\n              accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.       \n              The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2021 and will be reviewed again at\n              SAUL's next formal valuation in 2023.                                 \n                                                                                    \n              At the 31 March 2020 valuation SAUL was 94% funded on its Technical Provisions basis. However, market\n              movements following the valuation date were positive and the Trustee and Employers agreed to allow for\n              post-valuation experience up to 30 April 2021. As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at\n              that date, no deficit contributions were required. However, the Trustee and the Employers agreed that the\n              ongoing Employers' contributions would increase from a rate of 16% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE\n              salaries from 1 April 2022 and to 21% of CARE Salaries from 1 January 2023.\n              Employer contribution rates for SAUL Start are set at 16%, employee contribution rates are the same as for\n              the defined benefit scheme.                                           \n              Accounting Policy                                                     \n                                                                                    \n              Birkbeck is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and does not\n              identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of SAUL's\n              assets at 31 March 2020 was £3,612 million representing 94% of the liabilities. The market value of SAUL's\n              assets at 30 April 2021 was £4,369 million representing 109% of the estimated liabilities.\n              It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.\n              Birkbeck accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and pension costs\n              are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs 28.11 of FRS\n              102.                                                                  \n              Although there was a Technical Provision deficit at 31 March 2020, allowing for post valuation experience to\n              30 April 2021, SAUL has a Technical Provisions surplus. Therefore no deficit contributions were required\n              following the 2020 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit\n              contributions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the University.        \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 79",
