          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW                                          
                                                                                  
          Master’s Report                                                         
                                                                                  
          Operating environment                                                   
                                                                                  
          Since the ELQ crisis in 2008, and the dramatic drop in part-time        
          student numbers when the £9,000 fees were introduced in                 
          2012/13, Birkbeck has focussed on sustaining student numbers            
          and managing costs. This has enabled the College to remain              
          sustainable in the face of the decline of one of our core markets -     
          part-time undergraduate degrees. Over the period 2012/13 to             
          2016/17, part-time undergraduate degree enrolments have halved,         
          as have enrolments to undergraduate certificates. In the past two       
          cycles, there have been indications in some areas that the College      
          may have reached a lower but more stable level, particularly in part-   
          time undergraduate degrees. It is hoped that the introduction of        
          maintenance loans for part-time students from 2018/19 may               
          positively affect recruitment.                                          
          We are also pleased to note that the Government and media commentators regularly mention
          the importance of part-time students. However, because of the diversification of our offer and
          strong growth in other markets, overall student FTEs have been broadly stable right across this
          period of turbulence.                                                   
                                                                                  
          2016/17 resulted in strong growth in full-time and part-time postgraduate taught students for
          the College. Home and EU enrolments jumped by 11.8% (to 1,289 FTE) and 65.7% (to 653 FTE)
          for part-time and full-time Masters programmes respectively. These increases are likely to be due
          to the introduction of postgraduate loans for home and EU students. In this regard, it is
          particularly satisfying that very large increases were observed in the 30-60 age group following
          the success of the College’s political campaign which resulted in the raising of the age-limit of
          these loans from 30 (which was originally proposed) to 60.              
                                                                                  
          At undergraduate level, full time enrolments by UK and EU students increased slightly from
          2015/16 to 2016/17. This is particularly pleasing given the increase in competition in the sector
          following the removal of the student number control for undergraduate students from the UK and
          EU. The mature student market remains more volatile and harder to predict than 18-year old full-
          time undergraduates which most universities depend on and we are concerned that economic
          uncertainty and further competition may affect this particular part of our market.
          International recruitment has been a relatively small but increasing sector for the College. Since
          2013/14 income from international students, both full- time and part-time, has increased by
          9.6% to £8.2 million and now represents 12.1% of our total tuition fee income (7.5% of total
          income). The College became a Chevening partner in 2016/17 which increased our international
          profile. The scheme, which is funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, contributed to
          higher applications from international students for 2017/18 which in turn has led to higher
          numbers of students once again. We will look to further develop our international reach during
          2017/18.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Operating environment (continued)                                       
                                                                                  
          A number of new programmes were developed during the year including two innovative
          arrangements:                                                           
                                                                                  
            •  An 18 month part-time MBA (the first for the College) in conjunction with Central St
               Martins, University of the Arts. The aim was to create a new type of business graduate
               who can combine genuinely creative thinking and innovation with core financial and
               strategic management skills. This new development is likely to be the first in a suite of
               MBA programmes offering a different approach to the traditional MBA;
                                                                                  
            •  With the assistance of £50,000 funding from HEFCE, the Department of Computer
               Science developed a conversion Master’s degree in Data Sciences. This course will
               combine work in software engineering and data sciences to provide a Masters level
               qualification for those with no previous computer or data science experience.
          Portfolio development is undertaken by each of the five Schools on an annual basis to ensure
          that our programmes meet the needs of students and employers in London and beyond.
                                                                                  
          The College has always been committed to improving access to higher education for students,
          particularly for those who may not be able to directly enter an undergraduate programme. In
          2017/18, for the first time, students will be able to enter four-year full-time evening degree
          programmes which will begin with a Foundation Year and be followed by the standard three-year
          full-time evening degree programme. These programmes will be for students who do not meet
          standard requirements for the first year of a degree but who demonstrate the likely ability to
          complete a degree subject with an additional year of study at the outset.
                                                                                  
          In addition to promoting access for all students in this way, we have also funded a programme
          specifically for asylum seekers entitled “Bridges to Study”. Under this programme, 20 asylum
          seekers (who because of their status cannot obtain loans and are subject to international fees),
          will be given fully-funded undergraduate or postgraduate places at Birkbeck with a programme of
          additional support to smooth their transition to UK higher education.   
                                                                                  
          In October 2016 we launched the initial phase of our outreach teaching initiative in Tottenham.
          This is supported by the London Borough of Haringey (which contains no other University activity).
          Eighteen students have begun study on the course, each of whom is receiving a £2,000 bursary
          funded by Haringey for their study, so reducing the loan they need to take to £4,000 for this year.
          As with all Birkbeck students, these students are eligible for further bursary support based on low
          household income. Following completion of the introductory course, the students can progress to
          further degree study at Birkbeck.

          Operating environment (continued)                                       
                                                                                  
          Having successfully adapted our business model due to changes in government policy in 2008
          and 2012, it appears that the sector faces another period of prolonged uncertainty and
          increasing competition:                                                 
                                                                                  
            •  We do not yet know the outcome of the Brexit negotiations but have already seen a
               negative impact on applications from EU students domiciled on the continent and an
               even higher impact on those domiciled in the UK;                   
                                                                                  
            •  The UK government appears confused over how higher education should be funded. A
               review has been proposed with no clear objective or timescale and the previously
               announced annual increases in the home undergraduate fees have been rescinded;
                                                                                  
            •  There is a lot of negativity in the press about the value of a higher education qualification
               which is likely to reduce confidence in the sector amongst potential applicants;
            •  HEFCE have noted that there is increasing divergence between the financially well-off
                                                                                  
               HEIs and those that are struggling. This will inevitably increase competition;
            •  Implementation of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 is currently the subject
               of a suite of consultations. Notably, the consultation on the new Office for Students (OfS)
               seeks views on the proposed new regulatory framework which will be the system to
               regulate higher education. This consultation sets out the proposed new regulatory
               approach and what this will mean for the sector and students. It includes proposals for
               how higher education providers will enter the system, how they will be risk-assessed, the
               conditions they will have to meet, how they will be monitored, and what potential actions
               the OfS will be able to take;                                      
                                                                                  
            •  The cost of pensions, particularly in relation to USS, is becoming challenging to maintain.
                                                                                  
          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
          Birkbeck set out his vision:                                            
                                                                                  
               ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’
                                                                                  
          This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,
          work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer
          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,
          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. Within an increasingly volatile
          operating environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and
          contribution to science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all
          of our activities.

          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards received during
          the year.

          in Ljubljana. At Birkbeck, she has been responsible for developing and running a course exploring
          the psychoanalytical and emotional dimensions of the lawyer-client relationship, and more
          generally, the psychosocial dimensions of legal practice in the Critical Legal Practice LLM. The
          SASA in its present structure was founded in 1938, but its predecessor, the Academia
          Operosorum, dates back to 1693. It aims to cultivate, encourage and promote sciences and arts
          through its activities and contributions to the development of scientific thought and creativity in
          the arts.                                                               
          Claire Callender, Professor of Higher Education Policy at Birkbeck was awarded an OBE in 2017

          Fellow and alumna of the College, Dame Stephanie Shirley, was awarded the Companion of
          Honour in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list. The award is given to those who have made a major
          contribution to the arts, science, medicine or government over a long period of time. The order,
          now in its 100th year, is limited to 65 members, 45 from the UK and 20 from the
          Commonwealth. Dame Shirley is the first Birkbeck alumna to receive this accolade.
          Finally, Simon Davis, Governor of Birkbeck, has been elected President of the Law Society of
          England and Wales. He took up the role of deputy vice president in July 2017 and will become
          vice president in 2018 and president in 2019.                           
                                                                                  
          Teaching and research excellence                                        
                                                                                  
          The College is proud of its long tradition of providing flexible education courses delivered by
          research active staff to students of all ages, particularly those who live and work in the London
          region. We work very hard at ensuring that the quality of both our research and teaching is at a
          recognisably high standard whilst also enabling and encouraging students from diverse social
          and educational backgrounds to participate in our courses.              
                                                                                  
          The 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF2014) determined that 73% of our research was
          rated “world leading” or “internationally excellent” (compared with 56% in REF2008). 83% of our
          academic staff were returned in the REF, a figure that is well above the sector average.
                                                                                  
          When the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) was announced we were concerned that the
          metrics used may have unintentional consequences for us due to our unique mode of evening
          teaching. In recognition of feedback received during the consultation for the review, institutions
          were able to submit a detailed commentary alongside the pure data. We were delighted that the
          review panel acknowledged our unique position and awarded the College a Silver grade. The
          review panel noted evidence of:                                         
             • a range of strategic initiatives which contribute to positive outcomes for cohorts of
               students who would not otherwise engage with higher education, including unique
               provision of on-site programme delivery in the evenings;           
                                                                                  
             • programmes designed to support students from diverse backgrounds to gain knowledge
               and achieve their full potential through a curriculum which is at the forefront of research;
                                                                                  
             • ongoing implementation of strategic initiatives, some externally funded, to enhance
               retention for mature returners to higher education;                
                                                                                  
             •  systematic monitoring of student engagement by the College in order that personalised
                support can be offered to students such that they are able to fully engage and commit to
                their studies;                                                    
                                                                                  
             • implementation of an institutional culture which facilitates, recognises and rewards
               excellent teaching, including targeted staff development initiatives.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Teaching and research excellence (continued)                            
                                                                                  
          Shortly after the TEF results were published in June 2017, WONKHE (a renowned independent
          website with a mission to “improve policy making in higher education”) published an article which
          aimed to compare the REF and TEF results for institutions. They plotted the REF2014 grade point
          average intensity score against a 25 point scale devised by them to convert the TEF metrics into
          a “score”. Birkbeck appeared with 28 other institutions in the top right quadrant of the chart
          which the article described as institutions which “can be considered to be successful at research
          and teaching”. It is worth noting that only three of the institutions in this quadrant are based in
          London – Birkbeck, Imperial and Brunel.                                 
          Graduate earnings for our students also ranked well in the government’s Longitudinal
          Educational Outcomes (LEO) salary data report. Our students were the 14th highest earners
          among UK graduates and the sixth highest in London for the subjects we teach, outstripping the
          salaries of graduates from universities including the London School of Economics and Queen
          Mary, University of London.                                             
                                                                                  
          In the 2017 National Student Survey (NSS), Birkbeck was rated second among London
          institutions for teaching. 90% of students taking part in the survey agreed that their courses were
          intellectually stimulating - the sixth highest of any university in the country. We also scored higher
          than the average in England over all four questions about teaching and were rated highly for
          student satisfaction in many individual subjects with Philosophy named best in the country for
          overall satisfaction.                                                   
                                                                                  
          Although the TEF and REF confirmed that both our teaching and research are of high quality, and
          the NSS indicated that our students found their courses intellectually stimulating, feedback from
          students indicates that we could do better in student support and other aspects which contribute
          to the student experience. Although our evening model of teaching gives working Londoners
          access to higher education not available to them elsewhere, it also creates a unique challenge
          when it comes to improving the provision of services to our students, many of whom come to
          study straight from work. We are committed to this and are proposing to invest significantly in
          new supportive activities following the completion of a review of the student experience by the
          Pro Vice Master Education (report due for completion early 2018).       
          We have also set aside funding to further develop our research support in 2017/18. In the lead
          up to the next REF the Pro Vice Master Research has proposed new initiatives to support post
          graduate research students, early career researchers and established academics. It is our
          current aspiration to submit 100% of our research active staff to the next REF.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Estates                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary space,
          to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to improve research
          facilities. By the time we reach our 200th anniversary in 2023 it is our aim that all Birkbeck
          students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or in buildings shared with other
          HE institutions. Governors have approved the College Estate Strategy which determined that four
          projects were required to improve the quality of our research and teaching space and also to
          increase the amount of teaching space that was under the direct, or shared, control of the
          College.                                                                
          A governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards
          (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design teams,
          senior College staff and lay Governors) which feed in to Estates Committee (a sub-committee of
          Finance & General Purposes Committee). The structure aims to ensure that all aspects of each
          project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is obtained, the
          building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on major projects
          are also provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee to provide assurance that all risks are
          being appropriately managed.                                            
                                                                                  
          The first two projects - Toddlerlab (a new build to extend the research undertaken in the Babylab)
          and Cambridge House (the redevelopment of an office block for teaching) - are currently working
          towards planning submission. Both occupy independent sites in the control of the College and
          construction is expected to commence in 2018. Budget approval has only been granted for fees
          at this stage.                                                          
                                                                                  
          The bulk of our science research is currently undertaken in unsustainable space in the Malet
          Street extension building and needs to be rehoused. We are currently seeking a suitable site and
          developing initial requirements for the building. Once the research has been relocated the
          intention is to knock down the Malet Street extension and construct a new teaching block on the
          site. Indicative timelines suggest that construction could begin on the Science block in 2019 and
          the extension building in 2021.                                         
          In addition to the new building projects our long term cash flow forecast includes prudent
          estimates for: unspecified capital amendments to existing buildings; capital elements of our long
          term maintenance plan; replacement of existing combined heat and power system; and capital
          equipment. We do not expect to spend these funds in full but we are keen to ensure that the
          main building projects are affordable even in a scenario where significant additional capital
          funding was required.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Alumni and friends of the College                                       
                                                                                  
          The generosity of alumni, friends, corporate partners, charitable trusts and foundations is vital in
          enabling Birkbeck to continue amplifying our commitment to access and widening the impact of
          our world leading research.                                             
          Last year, Birkbeck raised over £3.3 million of new philanthropic income. Donations ranged from
          regular monthly gifts, several legacies and six-figure gifts from individuals and corporates. These
          donations supported a range of areas across the college including widening access provision,
          student support, academic research and capital projects.                
                                                                                  
          In 2016/17 over 300 volunteers donated nearly 3,500 hours of their time to supporting students
          across Birkbeck, aiding recruitment, retention and employability initiatives across the College.
                                                                                  
          Over the coming year we hope to further broaden our fundraising activity; deepening our
          relationships with current supporters and attracting new donors to support the College’s
          ambitious strategic priorities as we move towards the College’s 200th anniversary in 2023.
                                                                                  
          2016/17 was another very successful year for the College, both financially and academically. We
          are continuing with the academic and student support developments that are essential to
          creating the best possible environment for our students and we are embarking on a strategy for
          investment in the College estate, something which is essential for the long term sustainability
          and development of our teaching and research. On the back of a very strong performance in the
          2014 Research Excellence Framework we achieved a Silver grade in the 2017 Teaching
          Excellence Framework. These external reviews validate our strategic objective to deliver high
          quality teaching and research. Although there are an unprecedented number of significant
          uncertainties in the higher education sector at the moment we are confidently defining our
          ambitions and vision for Birkbeck in 2023 when the College will celebrate its 200th anniversary.

          The recurrent teaching grant from HEFCE continues to fall as an increasing proportion of our
          tuition fees are paid by student loans. Teaching grant fell by a further £1.6 million in 2016/17 (a
          reduction of 17.5%). HEFCE teaching grant now represents only 6% of College income in
          comparison with 47.5% in 2005/6. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from
          25.7% in 2005/6 to 62.8% in 2016/17 (up from 58.6% in 2015/16).         
          Other income has remained broadly similar over the last two years with the exception of a profit
          from sale of fixed asset of £3.2 million in 2015/16.

          Chart 3: Main levels of study enrolment trends 2011/12 to 2016/17       
                                                                                  
          Since 2012/13, total student numbers have been broadly stable, declining from 9,436 FTE to
          9,225 FTE in 2016/17, a fall of 2%. Beneath this top level figure there has been a lot of change,
          both in the types of students studying (undergraduate versus postgraduate) and by school. A
          dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate has been compensated for by growth in full-time
          undergraduate as can be clearly seen in Chart 3. In 2016/17, Masters recruitment showed a
          marked increase due to the introduction of the post graduate loan. The School of Business
          Economics & Informatics has grown by 25% over this period whilst the Schools of Arts, Social
          Sciences History & Philosophy and Science have fewer students. Law has similar numbers to
          2012/13 following a period of growth and then falling student numbers.  
                                                                                  
          Part-time student recruitment remains challenging for the sector and it is hoped that the
          introduction of maintenance loan funding for part time undergraduate students in 2018/19 will
          help to arrest the decline. Income from full-time Home and EU students increased by £3.3 million
          (15%) primarily as a result of the continuing increase in full time undergraduate numbers and the
          significant increase in Masters students (47% increase in full time Masters students). Income
          from international students (which represents just over 6% of total income) increased marginally
          over the previous year (£0.1 million) whilst part time student income fell by £1.8 million (5%)
          despite an increase in part time Masters enrolments of 12%.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017

          The analysis of expenditure confirms that the College continues to invest heavily in education
          and research with only 19.3% of total expenditure (2015/16: 19.1%) spent on administration
          and other professional services.                                        
                                                                                  
          Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision) has
          risen from 57.1% in 2014/15 to 61.1% in 2016/17 (see Table 1). The College does not own any
          student residences (which increase income without a corresponding increase in staff costs) so
          this percentage is one of the highest in the sector. The College regularly reviews the level of staff
          costs in relation to income and uses 60% as a benchmark during annual and long term planning.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Although restating the 2014/15 balance sheet with the transition to FRS 102 had the effect of
          substantially reducing total net assets when the pension liability and deferred capital grant
          adjustments were introduced, most of the data in Table 2 is reasonably comparable year on year.
          The creation of a pension deficit recovery plan in 2014/15 depressed the underlying financial
          performance whilst the sale of property and gain on investments increased the surplus in
          2015/16. In 2016/17, total income remained static overall whilst staff costs increased due to
          the annual inflationary rise and grade drift. The gain on investments of £1.3 million in 2015/16
          was largely reversed by a loss of £0.9 million the following year, although there was no impact on
          cash due to these adjustments.                                          
          What is clear from Table 2 is that the College is generating reasonably consistent levels of cash
          from operating activities. In 2016/17, the operating cash was affected by an unwinding of
          increases in year-end debtors and creditors in 2015/16 – a net reduction in operating cash of
          £2.2 million in 2016/17. Our strategy to return surpluses of 5% of income was primarily
          introduced to ensure that we generated cash to invest in our future. The cash reserves that we
          have built up will be invested back in to our estate with two projects entering the construction
          phase in early 2018.                                                    
                                                                                  
          The College is a member of two sector-wide pension schemes, both of which undertook a
          triennial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the schemes in 2017. Following the 2014
          valuation, both schemes reported a deficit and the College share of this deficit was included in
          the balance sheet for the first time under the FRS102 regulations. The deficit in the Universities
          Superannuation Scheme has increased at the latest valuation point and the formal review
          process is currently under way. Whilst the College is committed to providing attractive reward
          packages to all staff we are concerned that the deficit and an increase in the costs of providing
          for future pensions will negatively impact on our financial sustainability. With staff costs already
          representing over 60% of total income, further increases to our contributions will put significant
          strain on other elements of our budget.                                 
                                                                                  
          Despite concerns over the pension schemes which the College has little direct influence over, we
          are in a sound financial position with a strong cash base to invest in our future. That said, we are
          mindful of the unprecedented uncertainty in the higher education sector at the moment.
          Risk Management                                                         
                                                                                  
          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  
                                                                                  
          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to
          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit
          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key
          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main
          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and
          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and
          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,
          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The
          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual
          report on internal control and risk for 2016/17 was presented to the Audit Committee in May
          2017.                                                                   
          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk which can be achieved
          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  
                                                                                  
          The top risks for the College for 2017/18 outlined in the annual report are:
                                                                                  
            •  Estates Strategy                                                   
                                                                                  
               The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary
               space, to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to
               improve research facilities. By the time we reach our 200th anniversary in 2023 it is our
               aim that all Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or
               in buildings shared with other HE institutions. Governors have approved the College
               Estate Strategy (total value around £150 million) which determined that four projects
               were required. The first two building projects are planned to be on site in early 2018.
                                                                                  
               A number of risks have been noted in relation to the Estates Strategy including: projects
               do not effectively meet the stated objectives; project budgets are not appropriately
               managed; and long term cash levels negatively impact our financial sustainability. A
               governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards
               (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design
               teams, senior College staff and lay Governors) which feed in to Estates Committee (a sub-
               committee of Finance & General Purposes Committee). The structure aims to ensure that
               all aspects of each project are appropriately managed. Reports on major projects are also
               provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee and the management of major projects
               is routinely reviewed by our internal auditor.                     
               With an indicative budget of over £150 million the impact of the Estates Strategy on the
               College has been assigned a net risk of 12.0 (amber).

            •  Students                                                           
                                                                                  
               An inability to meet the needs of students and delivery of an optimal student experience
               could potentially impact both recruitment and retention, result in lower National Student
               Survey (NSS) scores with a consequent impact on both reputation and recruitment, and
               lead to students having an unsatisfactory university experience and not reaching their full
               potential.                                                         
               Although the Teaching Excellence Framework exercise resulted in a silver award for the
               College, the NSS has indicated that we need to focus on improving student support. The
               student body has changed over the last few years, with larger numbers of younger
               students with different needs and expectations choosing to study with us. Many of our
               students combine work with study and are consequently time poor. The College Pro Vice
               Master Education is undertaking a wide ranging review of the student experience with a
               view to recommending actions for improvement.                      
                                                                                  
               Although students find our programmes intellectually stimulating we are committed to
               improving the student experience. The potential impact on student recruitment of failing
               to provide services our students need is significant and the risk has been assigned a net
               score of 12.0 (amber).                                             
                                                                                  
            •  Planning and prioritisation of investment                          
                                                                                  
               The higher education environment is more competitive than ever (new entrants to the
               market, development of innovative modes of delivery, removal of student number
               controls, changing expectations from students) and more uncertain (Brexit, government
               policy, changing attitudes to higher education). As such, it is important for the College to
               dynamically adapt to circumstances to ensure financial sustainability.
                                                                                  
               To help ensure our financial sustainability, rolling five year plans (including portfolio
               review) are prepared by each School and Professional Service annually and the financial
               implications are combined with capital aspirations to develop ten year forecasts.
               Innovative new initiatives are encouraged and a Planning Group including School
               Executive Deans and key strategic staff has been set up to consider areas for investment.
               Strategic Planning Committee is the executive body responsible for ensuring
               sustainability.                                                    
               Although long term planning has improved the uncertain external environment has
               resulted in this risk being assigned a score of 10.5 (amber).      
                                                                                  
          Brexit has not been included in our risk register as a specific risk due to the lack of progress
          made in negotiations and the uncertain impact on universities (although it is expected that the
          impact is likely to be negative for the sector). There is a differential risk between students
          resident in the EU losing access to UK student loans and that of EU nationals recognised as
          already living in the UK, whose status will be established during the negotiations. At Birkbeck,
          around three quarters of undergraduate students classified by the SLC as EU tell us that they are
          living in the UK when they apply to study. If all EU citizens living in the UK are granted ‘full UK
          rights’ after Brexit, then these students should still be able to access loans. We have undertaken
          a range of modelling using different assumptions but believe that the risk to income for the
          College may be slightly lower than for other institutions due to the fact that most of our students
          are already working in London when they apply to study. Fees Bursaries & Scholarships
          Committee are overseeing the risk to students and reporting regularly to Governors. This risk will
          be carefully monitored as government negotiations progress.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Audit Committee was provided with an update in September of the main developments since
          they approved the College risk register in May. Whilst this noted in particular the negative
          publicity in the press around Vice Chancellor salaries, Brexit uncertainties and increased
          competition for students, sector uncertainty has increased still further following the
          announcement by the Government that regulated fees would no longer rise in line with inflation
          and that a significant review of HE funding was to be undertaken. Although we had been closely
          monitoring student recruitment all year, conversion rates from application to enrolment appear to
          have fallen despite applications being buoyant. The impact of this on income coupled with the
          changes to student funding announced by the government recently will require us to review our
          plans. The risk register will be updated and represented to Audit Committee for oversight as
          appropriate.                                                            
          On behalf of the Governing Body, I would like to thank all staff for their dedication and support in
          ensuring the success of Birkbeck and its unique mission as a research-led teaching institution
          with a strong commitment to flexible patterns of teaching.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017

          Public Benefit Statement                                                
                                                                                  
          The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:                         
                                                                                  
          “The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
          who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
          instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
          any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
          may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
                                                                                  
          As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
          required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Governing Body has
          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in
          the following manner.                                                   
          The College aims to provide higher education opportunities to people who would not otherwise
          have access, continuing the mission since its inception. The College’s founder, George Birkbeck,
          had a vision of the power of education to transform and improve lives, and this founding
          commitment to social change and widening access is a core strand of what still drives the
          College today. The College’s mission includes “enabling students from diverse social and
          educational backgrounds to participate”. As London’s only specialist provider of evening higher
          education, Birkbeck has long encouraged applications from students without traditional
          qualifications or from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. 
                                                                                  
          We actively encourage students with non-traditional qualifications to study at Birkbeck and offer
          various flexible routes into study including Certificates of Higher Education and (from 2017/18)
          undergraduate degrees with an additional Foundation year. Data from 2015/16 which was
          included in our 2018/19 Access Agreement with the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) highlighted
          that:                                                                   
                                                                                  
            •  35% of part-time entrants at Birkbeck had either level 2 (equivalent to GCSE), level 1 or
               no entry qualifications in 2015/16.                                
                                                                                  
          Our outreach work, alongside the various entry routes to degree study, support students without
          traditional entry qualifications to study successfully at Birkbeck. That a high proportion of part-
          time students do not have a level 3 qualification is a strong demonstration of our commitment to
          widening participation and to facilitating social mobility.             
          Given our evening model of study, we attract a high proportion of mature students. 40% of our
          undergraduate degree students chose to study part-time in 2016/17 and 94% of these students
          are over 21 (as compared to 66% of full-time students). However, recruitment to our full-time
          programmes has been more successful in recent years than to our part-time programmes: higher
          fees and debt aversion have clearly been a deterrent to many mature, part-time students. The
          introduction of maintenance loans for part-time students from 2018/19 may encourage some of
          these students back to higher education. Unlike most higher education institutions, much of our
          outreach work is with mature students with no previous experience of higher education,
          especially those who have low incomes.

          noted that:                                                             
                                                                                  
             • 32% of our part-time students were eligible for Birkbeck financial support in 2015/16
               (criteria of household income below £40,000); and                  
             • 40% of our full-time students were eligible for Birkbeck financial support in 2015/16
               (criteria of household income of below £25,000).                   
                                                                                  
          We are pleased that full-time programmes delivered in the evening are proving attractive to
          students from low income backgrounds and that we are able to offer attractive opportunities to
          students who we would not have been able to reach with part-time provision.
                                                                                  
          The Access Agreement also highlighted that:                             
                                                                                  
             • 7.4% of our part-time students were eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) in
               2015/16;                                                           
                                                                                  
             • 7.4% of our full-time students were eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) in
               2015/16; and                                                       
                                                                                  
             • 16% of full-time and part-time students declared to us that they had a disability in
               2016/17.                                                           
                                                                                  
          It should be noted that supporting part-time students is more resource intensive than supporting
          full-time students, as they represent a Full Time Equivalent of less than one but require equal
          levels of support. The figures show that there are significant numbers of students who do not
          receive DSA but may well require additional assistance in order to study successfully. Both our
          Disability and Dyslexia and Mental Health Advice Services work closely with these students to
          ensure that they are given the best possible opportunity to succeed.    
          The proportion of BME students on our full-time programmes remains high:
                                                                                  
             • 55% of full-time students were from BME groups in 2015/16; and     
                                                                                  
             • 39% of part-time students were from BME groups in 2015/16.         
                                                                                  
          Our widening access provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than
          focusing on ethnicity but as our work is exclusively in London our approach invariably means that
          we work with high numbers of students from BME groups.                  
                                                                                  
          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by
          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In
          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.
          We also offer self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free
          monthly instalments over the academic year.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Public Benefit Statement (continued)                                    
                                                                                  
          As well as the expenditure on financial support, we spend considerable amounts on ensuring that
          our students are successful while they are with us, and that they are well placed in the jobs
          market on graduation. Our evening provision uniquely enables students to combine study in the
          evening with meaningful work during the day. In order to support students to gain paid and
          relevant job placements we have invested in our capacity to provide a particular type of careers
          support and offer a service to create job brokerage called Birkbeck Talent.
                                                                                  
          As an example of a new initiative developed during 2016/17, Birkbeck has created the Compass
          Project Outreach Programme and the Compass Project Fund. Set up with the support of
          international law firm Allen & Overy and the Z Foundation, the Outreach Programme provides pre-
          entry support to asylum seekers, with free workshops and events throughout the year. These
          events and workshops are available to anyone who has sought sanctuary in the UK.
          The Project Fund will offer 20 asylum seekers per year a fully-funded place on an undergraduate
          or postgraduate certificate course at Birkbeck. Asylum seekers often arrive in the UK without
          documentation, limiting their ability to find work or to enrol in courses of study. Unlike those
          classified as refugees, their immigration status means that they are treated as international
          students, with university fees set at the higher international rate and with no access to loan
          support. This is often prohibitive for asylum seekers hoping to continue into higher education. As
          well as offering funded places to asylum seekers we will also provide a tailored programme of
          additional social and academic support to ensure a smooth transition into the British higher
          education system. Additionally, each successful applicant will be assigned a personal tutor to
          help them to navigate the academic processes at Birkbeck and provide pastoral care, as well as
          a dedicated student buddy.                                              
                                                                                  
          20 students, including some from Syria, Iran and the Democratic Republic of Congo, commenced
          programmes in September 2017. The students are studying courses in politics, data science,
          economics, healthcare, international development, law, international security and global
          governance, and legal methods.                                          
                                                                                  
          We will continue to invest significantly in activities which support student access, progression,
          success and employability. A wide-ranging review of the student experience at Birkbeck is being
          undertaken by the Pro Vice Master Education and it is expected that a number of
          recommendations for improvement will be made when the report is finalised in early 2018.
          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
          the Charities Act. The following table summarises our research income over the last three years:

          Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. The College currently has a
          portfolio of live research projects linked to nearly £50 million in external grant funding.

          The following examples highlight how our research contributes to a range of public benefit
          criteria.                                                               
                                                                                  
          The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science               
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck has been awarded £1.8 million Institutional Strategic Support Funding (ISSF) by
          Wellcome, for the period 2016-2019. The ISSF funding enables the College to invest in areas
          that are of mutual strategic importance to Birkbeck and Wellcome and promotes excellence in
          research.                                                               
          The funding will be used to develop biomedical-related scholarship across the College, with the
          aim of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration and public engagement with biomedical research
          and humanities related to human and animal health. It will also be used to create new
          opportunities for postgraduate and early career researchers and mid-career researchers,
          particularly any individuals returning to work after career breaks.     
                                                                                  
          This is the second ISSF award made to Birkbeck by Wellcome. A portion of the first grant was
          used to develop the College’s public engagement activity and supported 11 public engagement
          projects including theatre, exhibitions, interactive workshops and development of new teaching
          resources.                                                              
                                                                                  
          The advancement of health or saving of lives                            
                                                                                  
          Researchers at Birkbeck and King’s College London, including Dr Tim Smith, Birkbeck Reader in
          Cognitive Psychology, questioned 715 parents about their child’s daily touchscreen use and
          sleep patterns. Their findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports in April 2017. They
          found that babies and toddlers who spent more time using a touchscreen slept less at night and,
          despite sleeping more during the day, slept for less time overall and also took longer to fall
          asleep. For every additional hour of touchscreen use during the day, children were sleeping for
          nearly 16 minutes less in each 24 hour period. Sleep is important for cognitive development -
          especially during the first few years of life, so the findings have important implications. Of the
          families participating in the study, 75% of the toddlers (aged between 6 months and 3 years)
          used a touchscreen on a daily basis, increasing from 51% at 6-11 months to 92% at 25-36
          months.                                                                 
          An earlier study from the research team showed that increased active touchscreen use (for
          example scrolling, rather than passively watching videos) was associated with earlier

          understand in depth how to use modern technology in a way which maximizes benefits and
          minimizes any negative consequences for young children.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Public Benefit Statement (continued)                                    
                                                                                  
          The advancement of environmental protection or improvement              
                                                                                  
          Dr Sue Brooks, Birkbeck Reader in Environmental Systems Analytics, published a paper in the
          journal Geography which assessed the impact of the extreme storms that occurred in the winter
          of 2013/14 in the UK, where monthly rainfall was over 200% of the 1981 to 2010 average. The
          damage from this extreme weather affected landforms, habitats, societies and infrastructure,
          and varied noticeably across the UK. Several high-magnitude storms over the course of the
          winter were particularly devastating in the west and south-west of the UK while a single extreme
          storm did most of the damage in the east.                               
          The article highlighted how new technologies can be used to quantify some of the key coastal
          impacts of such events. It also explored the need for new strategies for forecasting, early warning
          and evacuation planning to mitigate possible future damage in the context of rising sea levels
          and changing storm tracks.                                              
          The promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown, or of the efficiency of the
          police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services                  
                                                                                  
          The College has worked closely with the Institute for Criminal Policy Research (ICPR) for a number
          of years and in 2016/17 it was agreed with the trustees of the charity to transfer the staff,
          assets and liabilities of the charity to Birkbeck. Including the Institute within the College
          infrastructure would provide improved administrative efficiency and financial sustainability which
          would allow the researchers to concentrate on their research.           
                                                                                  
          Current projects include being part of an academic consortium that has won a £3.3 million grant
          from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the College of Policing to mount a
          three-year programme of work to build more evidence around what really works in reducing
          crime. The consortium will map the existing evidence base for crime reduction, label it for quality,
          cost and impact, and make it easily accessible for practitioners and decision makers.
                                                                                  
          In a separate project, ICPR, together with Birkbeck's Department of Organisational Psychology, is
          engaged in a Home Office-funded project which also involves collaboration with the Mayor's
          Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC), the Jill Dando Institute, University College London and
          eight UK police forces. The project aims to develop the training curriculum for police graduate
          recruits to include - and encourage further discussion about - evidence-informed practice; and to
          evaluate the response to this training, including its usefulness and application in post training
          placements.                                                             
          At the point of incorporation into the College, ICPR had net assets totalling £0.3 million.

          STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE GOVERNORS' RESPONSIBILITIES                    
                                                                                  
          In accordance with the Charter and Statutes of the College, the Governors are responsible for
          exercising the powers of the College. Governors have oversight of the College's affairs and are
          responsible for ensuring effective administration, management and internal control. The
          Governing Body is required to present audited financial statements for each financial year.
                                                                                  
          The Governors act as the trustees of the College and are responsible for ensuring that proper
          accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
          position of the College; and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements are prepared
          in accordance with the College’s Charter and Statutes, the Statement of Recommended Practice
          on Accounting for Further and Higher Education and FRS102: The financial reporting standard
          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. In addition, within the terms and conditions of the
          Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability agreed between the Governors of the College and
          the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Governors, through the Master as
          designated office holder, are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year
          which give a true and fair view of the College's state of affairs and of its income and expenditure,
          gains and losses, changes in reserves and cash flows for the year.      
          In causing the financial statements to be prepared, the Governors have ensured that:
                                                                                  
          • suitable accounting policies are selected and applied consistently;   
                                                                                  
          • judgements and estimates are made that are reasonable and prudent;    
                                                                                  
          • applicable accounting standards have been followed;                   
                                                                                  
          • financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
            presume that the College will continue in operation; and              
                                                                                  
          • they are satisfied that the College has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
            foreseeable future (for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the
            preparation of the financial statements).                             
                                                                                  
          The Governors have taken reasonable steps to:                           
                                                                                  
          • ensure that funds from the Higher Education Funding Council for England are used only for
            the purposes for which they have been given and in accordance with the Memorandum of
            Assurance and Accountability with the Funding Council and any other conditions which the
            Funding Council may from time to time prescribe;                      
                                                                                  
          • ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to safeguard
            public funds and funds from other sources;                            
                                                                                  
          • safeguard the assets of the College and prevent and detect fraud; and 
                                                                                  
          • secure the economical, efficient and effective management of the College’s resources and
            expenditure.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT                                          
                                                                                  
          Corporate governance and accountability arrangements                    
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck College is a body incorporated by Royal Charter. Although the College does not have
          shareholders, and is not a listed company, the Governing Body is committed to achieving high
          standards of corporate governance in line with accepted best practice. This summary describes
          the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in the UK Corporate
          Governance Code (2016) insofar as they relate to universities. Its purpose is to help the reader of
          the accounts understand how the principles have been applied.           
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body                                                      
          The Governing Body (“Governors”) comprises lay members, students, alumni and employees
          appointed under the Statutes of the College, the majority of whom are non-executive. There is a
          majority of lay members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the Governing Body are
          separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.    
                                                                                  
          The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and
          Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities and under the
          Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability with the Higher Education Funding Council for
          England. The Governing Body is responsible for the ongoing strategic direction of the College,
          approval of major developments and the receipt of regular reports from Senior Management on
          the day to day operations of its business.                              
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is responsible for the College's system of internal control and for reviewing
          its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
          against material misstatement or loss.                                  
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including
          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and
          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of
          reference. All lay members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the Governors
          on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.                     
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE
          and the Committee for University Chairs for regular effectiveness reviews. The review concluded
          that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in place
          measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more
          opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings. In 2016/17
          four new lay governors were appointed following an open call for expressions of interest, which
          increased the diversity of the Governing Body.                          
          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of
          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. It has
          asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's processes and practices in line with the
          provisions of the Code. The Governing Body has approved, and will annually review, a set of Key
          Performance Indicators linked to College strategic objectives.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
          managing the College's significant risks, linked to the achievement of strategic objectives, that
          the process has been in place for the year ended 31 July 2017 and up to the date of approval of
          the annual accounts, that it is regularly reviewed by the Governing Body and that it accords with
          the internal control guidance for directors in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2016) and the
          principles in the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.
          Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee                   
                                                                                  
          On all academic matters the Governors must consider, but not necessarily follow, the advice of
          the Academic Board, which is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the
          College. The Academic Board has a membership of around 150 drawn almost entirely from
          academic staff and the students of the College and chaired by the Master. It delegates some of
          its powers to its Executive Committee.                                  
                                                                                  
          Finance and General Purposes Committee                                  
                                                                                  
          The Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&GPC) reviews and then recommends to the
          Governors the College’s annual revenue and capital budgets and monitors performance in
          relation to the approved budgets. It reviews and then recommends to Governors the financial
          regulations and financial policies that are applied to management. It reviews the annual financial
          statements and considers financial strategy. In addition, the Investment Committee is
          responsible for the College investments on behalf of F&GPC.             
                                                                                  
          The Finance and General Purposes Committee met three times during the year.
                                                                                  
          Nominations Committee                                                   
                                                                                  
          The Nominations Committee considers nominations for lay member vacancies in the Governing
          Body membership under the relevant Statute and for Governing Body appointed vacancies on
          College Committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into account the balance of skills,
          knowledge and experience of members and are based on assessment against objective criteria.
          It also considers issues of succession planning and diversity within the Governing Body.
          The Nominations Committee met once during the year.                     
                                                                                  
          Remuneration Committee                                                  
                                                                                  
          The Remuneration Committee determines the annual remuneration of the Master and of
          professorial and senior administrative staff. Lay members of Governing Body receive no
          remuneration for their services although expenses incurred in attending meetings are met by the
          College. Members of the Governing Body who are employees of the College receive no additional
          remuneration for their services to the Governing Body. The cost of living salary increases for all
          staff are determined by national pay negotiations for all universities. The employee members
          have no involvement in determining their own salaries.                  
                                                                                  
          The Remuneration Committee met once during the year.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Audit Committee                                                         
                                                                                  
          The Audit Committee comprises wholly lay members drawn from the Governing Body plus a co-
          opted member and so has no executive responsibility. Members have recent, relevant financial
          and other appropriate experience. The Audit Committee met four times during the year.
          The Audit Committee relies substantially on the work of the internal and external auditors, on the
          information provided by management and the response of management to the questions it
          raises.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The remit of the Audit Committee includes:                              
            •  reviewing the effectiveness of the College’s systems of internal control and risk
               management;                                                        
            •  satisfying itself and assuring the Governors that satisfactory arrangements are in place to
               promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness thereby securing value for money;
            •  reviewing and approving the remit of the internal audit function;  
            •  advising the Governors, as necessary, on the appointment and remuneration of the
               internal and external auditors, and their quality, reliability and effectiveness;
            •  reviewing with the external auditors the scope and nature of the audit, including the
               report to Audit Committee written by the external auditors; and    
            •  assessing compliance with the HE regulatory framework.             
                                                                                  
          The external and internal auditors have a standing arrangement to meet with the Audit
          Committee regularly without senior officers present. The auditors also attend meetings with
          senior officers to consider the items listed above and to review plans for the audit process.
                                                                                  
          The College’s internal audit function provides, by undertaking review, independent objective
          assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk
          management framework and the design and effectiveness of the operation of internal controls
          that are intended to control critical business application risks. Internal audit also helps the
          College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating
          and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by
          working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by
          internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews
          are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate
          action confirmed to the Audit Committee. The head of the internal audit has unfettered access to
          the Audit Committee.                                                    
                                                                                  
          The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
          dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
          monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
          that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports regularly thereon to the
          Audit Committee.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Audit Committee (continued)                                             
                                                                                  
          The senior management team and the Audit Committee receive regular reports, including value
          for money reports, from internal audit which include recommendations for improvement. The
          Audit Committee's role in this area is to carry out a high level review of the arrangements for
          internal financial control. The Audit Committee and the Strategic Planning Committee review risk
          and control during the annual compilation of the risk register and report to the Governing Body.
          The Audit Committee also reports on the effectiveness of the College’s management of risks to
          the Governing Body each term. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance
          and not merely reporting by exception. At its summer 2017 meeting, the Governing Body
          approved the risk management report for 2016/17 and the risk register for 2017/18, taking into
          account reports from College management and the Audit Committee. In November 2017 the
          Governing Body considered and approved the annual report of the Audit Committee on its work
          during 2016/17, including a report from the internal auditor.           
          Strategic Planning Committee                                            
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Planning Committee consists of College officers with strategic management
          responsibility. Its remit is to consider College-wide strategic issues and priorities and to advise
          Finance and General Purposes Committee and Governors accordingly. It is responsible for
          internal planning and resource allocation policy and procedures. It oversees the annual planning
          and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and Professional Services on developing
          plans and co-ordinates and integrates plans for presentation to Finance and General Purposes
          Committee. The Committee has established and regularly monitors Key Performance Indicators
          that measure performance against the objectives set. It is also responsible for fee levels and
          scholarship policy and advises Finance and General Purposes Committee and Governors
          accordingly.                                                            
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Planning Committee met nine times during the year.        
                                                                                  
          The membership of all of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-6.

               2016-17 financial statements.                                      
                                                                                  
          Basis for opinion                                                       
          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
          (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical
          responsibilities under, and are independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical
          requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have
          obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.         
                                                                                  
          Going concern                                                           
          We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of
          accounting is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast
          significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of
          approval of the financial statements. We have nothing to report in these respects.
                                                                                  
          Other information                                                       
          The Board of Governors is responsible for the other information, which comprises the Operating
          and financial review and Corporate Governance Statement. Our opinion on the financial
          statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit
          opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.                    
          Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on
          our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or
          inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work, we
          have not identified material misstatements in the other information.    
                                                                                  
          Board of Governors responsibilities                                     
          As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 30 to 31, the Board of Governors is
          responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give
          a true and fair view; such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation
          of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
          assessing the group and parent College’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
          applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting
          unless it either intends to liquidate the group or the parent College or to cease operations, or has
          no realistic alternative but to do so.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                    
                                                                                  
          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,         
          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)                                        
                                                                                  
          Auditor’s responsibilities                                              
          Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
          whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our
          opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not
          guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
          misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
          material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
          economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
          A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at
          www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.                                
                                                                                  
          REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS                       
          We are required to report on the following matters under the HEFCE Audit Code of Practice
          (effective 1 August 2016) issued under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
          In our opinion, in all material respects:                               
            •  funds from whatever source administered by the Group or the College for specific
               purposes have been properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with
               relevant legislation; and                                          
                                                                                  
            •  funds provided by HEFCE have been applied in accordance with the Memorandum of
               Assurance and Accountability and any other terms and conditions attached to them.

          no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
          responsibility to anyone other than the College and the Board of Governors for our audit work, for
          this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

       Statement of Accounting Policies                                           
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       1.    Basis of preparation                                                 
                                                                                  
             These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
             Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2015 and in accordance with Financial
             Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
             Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
             requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
             convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       2.    Basis of consolidation                                               
                                                                                  
             The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to 31
             July 2017. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
                                                                                  
             The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union
             as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       3.    Income recognition                                                   
                                                                                  
             Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
             Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms
             of the contract have been satisfied.                                 
                                                                                  
             Fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the Consolidated
                                                                                  
             Statement of Income and Comprehensive Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.
             Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is
             shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not
             deducted from income.                                                
                                                                                  
             Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure
             on a receivable basis.                                               
                                                                                  
             Grant funding                                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Government revenue grants, including funding council teaching and research grants, are recognised as
             income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended
             to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income within
             creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more than one year as
             appropriate.                                                         
                                                                                  
             Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
             College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received in
             advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors
             and released to income as the conditions are met.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       3.    Income recognition (continued)                                       
                                                                                  
             Donations and endowments                                             
                                                                                  
             Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
             endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
             when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is
             utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
                                                                                  
             Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
             during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to the
             terms applied to the individual endowment fund.                      
                                                                                  
             There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
                                                                                  
          a) Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective;
          b) Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
             invested to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College;
          c) Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
                                                                                  
             to generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
                                                                                  
             Capital grants                                                       
                                                                                  
             Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
             were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the College has
             satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
                                                                                  
       4.    Accounting for retirement benefits                                   
                                                                                  
             College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
             (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
             primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
             professionally qualified independent actuaries.                      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
             of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
             contribution retirement benefit schemes.                             
                                                                                  
             A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
             schemes.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       4.    Accounting for retirement benefits (continued)                       
                                                                                  
             Defined contribution plan                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed
             contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
             amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
             expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
                                                                                  
             Defined benefit plan                                                 
                                                                                  
             Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine
             its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed by a
             qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
             recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
             through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       5.    Employment benefits                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
             expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are
             accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused
             entitlement.                                                         
                                                                                  
       6.    Finance leases                                                       
                                                                                  
             Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
             asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
             corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
             and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
                                                                                  
             Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
             outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
             a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       7.    Service concession arrangements                                      
                                                                                  
             Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
             present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
             financial liability.                                                 
                                                                                  
             Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
             charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
             arrangement.                                                         
                                                                                  
       8.    Operating leases                                                     
                                                                                  
             Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
             premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.       
                                                                                  
       9.    Foreign currency                                                     
                                                                                  
             Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
             transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
             are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
             exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
             year.                                                                
                                                                                  
       10.   Fixed assets                                                         
                                                                                  
             Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
             losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
             transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
             at the date of that revaluation.                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
             assets.                                                              
                                                                                  
             Land and buildings                                                   
                                                                                  
             Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
             initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
             benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
             life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.         
                                                                                  
             The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
             depreciated as follows:                                              
             Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                           
             Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                        
                                                                                  
             Leasehold land: the life of the lease                                
             Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       10.   Fixed assets (continued)                                             
                                                                                  
             Equipment                                                            
                                                                                  
             Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
             equipment is capitalised.                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
             lives are as follows:                                                
             Computer hardware: 3 years                                           
             Equipment acquired for specific research projects: 3 to 5 years      
             Other equipment: 5 years                                             
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
             Balance Sheet.                                                       
                                                                                  
       11.   Heritage assets                                                      
                                                                                  
             Works of art and other valuable artefacts have been capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of
             the acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not
             depreciated as their long economic life means that any depreciation would not be material.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       12.   Intangible assets                                                    
                                                                                  
             Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
             software implementations are treated as intangible assets with depreciation commencing once the initial
             phase of development is complete.                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       13.   Investments                                                          
                                                                                  
             Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
             Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
             investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
             year.                                                                
                                                                                  
       14.   Stock                                                                
                                                                                  
             Stock is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value and is measured using an average cost
             formula.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       15.   Cash and cash equivalents                                            
                                                                                  
             Cash includes cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts. Deposits are repayable on
             demand if they are available within 24 hours without penalty.        
                                                                                  
             Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
             of cash with insignificant change in value.                          
                                                                                  
       16.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets             
                                                                                  
             Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:          
          a) The College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
                                                                                  
          b) It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
          c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     
                                                                                  
             The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
             pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.          
                                                                                  
             A contingent liability arises from a past event that gives the College a possible obligation whose existence
             will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly within the
             control of the College. Contingent liabilities also arise in circumstances where a provision would otherwise
             be made but either it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the
             obligation cannot be measured reliably.                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             A contingent asset arises where an event has taken place that gives the College a possible asset whose
             existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly
             within the control of the College.                                   
                                                                                  
             Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the notes.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       17.   Taxation                                                             
                                                                                  
             The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College
             is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories
             covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation
             of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively
             charitable purposes.                                                 
                                                                                  
             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
             included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
             cost.                                                                
                                                                                  
             The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial
             organisation.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       18.   Reserves                                                             
                                                                                  
             Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
             which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
             must hold in perpetuity.                                             
                                                                                  
             Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
             therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.

           Along with all other staff of the College, the Master received the national pay award of 1% from
           1 August 2016.                                                         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           From 1 April 2016 the Governors agreed alternate pension arrangements for the Master which
           resulted in a net reduction in cost for the College. The College continues to contribute 2.1% of salary
           towards the USS pension deficit - the same percentage as for all members of the scheme.

           The College govorners are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the College's
           operations and the compositions of the Council, being drawn from local public and private sector
           organisations, transactions may take place with organisations in which a Governor may have an
           interest. No such transactions have taken place during the year (2015/16: none).
                                                                                  
           None of the govorners received any remuneration or waived payments from the group during the year
           (2015/16: none).

           The obligation to fund the past deficits on the pension schemes arises from the contractual relationship with
           the schemes for total payments relating to benefits arising from past performance. Management have
           estimated the number of future employees within the pension schemes and the salary payments made to
           the employees over the period of the contracted obligation when assessing the value of this provision.

           The College owns 100% of the shares of its subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Ltd. The principal
           activity of the company is to own and develop a building on the Euston Road. The company is registered in
           England.

           All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any
           significant personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the
           composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations)
           it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of
           staff may have an interest. All transactions are conducted at arms length in accordance with the financial
           regulations of the College. There were no material transactions during the year with related parties (2015/16:
           nil).                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students'
           Union as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £264,000
           (2015/16: £264,000) was provided to the Union. There were no debtor or creditor balances outstanding at
           the year end.

           Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
           • Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS)                            
           • The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)   
                                                                                  
           Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered
           funds.                                                                 
                                                                                  
           The total cost charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure was:

           (i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)                      
                                                                                  
           Prior to 31 March 2016, the scheme was a defined benefit only scheme which was contracted out of the
           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the
           S2P. A defined contribution section was introduced in October 2016. The fund is independently
           administered by trustees. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not hypothecated to
           individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The College is, therefore, exposed to
           actuarial risks associated with the employees of other institutions and is unable to identify its share of the
           underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Consequently, and as
           required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the College accounts for the scheme as if it were a
           defined contribution scheme.                                           
                                                                                  
           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists
           of a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer
           scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide
           scheme such as that provided by USS. The members of USS have entered into an agreement with the
           scheme trustees which determines how they will fund the net pension deficit in the scheme. The accounting
           principles pertaining to multi-employer schemes require the College to recognise the contributions payable
           that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) as a liability in the Balance Sheet.
                                                                                  
           The resulting expense is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure. College
           governors are satisfied that the scheme provided by USS meets the definition of a multi-employer scheme
           and have, therefore, recognised as a liability the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under
           the funding plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2017                       
                                                                                  
       Notes to the Accounts (continued)                                          
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
       28  Pension schemes (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation date”). The
           valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. Since the College cannot identify its share of the
           scheme assets and liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for the scheme as a whole.
           The 2014 valuation was prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act
           2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to have sufficient and appropriate
           assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme was
           £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion. This results in a net
           shortfall of £5.3 billion. The assets, therefore, were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had
           accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The defined benefit liability for the scheme has been produced using the following assumptions:
                                                                                  
                                                2017          2016

           Pension increases                     2.4%         2.2%                
                                                                                  
           Mortality in retirement is assumed to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S1NA
           tables as follows:                                                     
                                                                                  
           Male members’ mortality: 98% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – no age rating
                                                                                  
           Female members’ mortality: 99% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – rated down 1 year
                                                                                  
           Use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience. To allow for further
           improvements in mortality rates the CMI 2014 projections with a 1.5% pa long term rate were also adopted.

       Notes to the Accounts (continued)                                          
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2017                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       28  Pension schemes (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
           (ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)
                                                                                  
           The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the
           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the
           S2P.                                                                   
                                                                                  
           SAUL is an independently managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
           institutions with links to higher education.                           
                                                                                  
           Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on either a final salary basis or a career average
           revalued earnings (“CARE”) basis. Following a consultation with members, it was agreed that the final salary
           section would close from 31 March 2016 and all members would subsequently build up benefits on a CARE
           basis.                                                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations
           under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the
           amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
           spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.
                                                                                  
           SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
           the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The trustees adopt
           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits
           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from members’ accrued
           pension rights to be met.                                              
                                                                                  
           The assumptions used to calculate the Technical Provisions include appropriate margins to allow for the
           possibility of events turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not
           completely remove the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the
           future.                                                                
                                                                                  
           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2014.
           Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The funding principles were agreed in November 2015 and are due to be reviewed at SAUL’s next formal
           valuation in 2017.                                                     
                                                                                  
           The trustees and employers agreed that the Technical Provisions deficit at the 31 March 2014 valuation will
           be addressed by employer contributions of 3% of salaries between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2018
           (inclusive). As a result the overall level of the employers’ contributions increased from 13% of salaries to
           16% of Salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.
