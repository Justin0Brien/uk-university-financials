Most of our students are mature and\n          have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The age of our students ranges from 18\n          to 80 and our student body is diverse with 40% from BAME backgrounds and 58% women. As\n          well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing international student community now\n          welcoming students from 120 countries around the world.                 \n                                                                                  \n          Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that\n          proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was very\n          successful in the 2014 Research Assessment Exercise (REF) submitting 83% of eligible staff with\n          approximately three-quarters of their research being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or\n          ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). In terms of national higher education quality assessments, we are\n          one of the minority of institutions that rate highly both for REF and for TEF, the teaching\n          excellence framework.                                                   \n          Response to the Covid pandemic                                          \n                                                                                  \n          The coronavirus pandemic hit all sectors of the UK economy in 2020 and changed the lives of\n          billions of people worldwide. Our response, in finding effective new ways to work, operate and\n          support students, is a testament to the determination and resilience of the whole Birkbeck\n          community. I need to put on record my thanks to our staff for their dedication and hard work and\n          to our students for their fortitude and commitment.                     \n                                                                                  \n          The safety of our staff and students has been paramount as we implemented revised policies\n          and ways of working. In late March 2020 we moved all teaching online and moved swiftly to\n          provide the means for staff to work predominantly from home. Of course, not all services and\n          facilities can run online. Physical assets still need maintenance and ultimately online capacity\n          relies on physical infrastructure. I need to particularly thank all those colleagues who continued\n          to work onsite through a very challenging period to keep Birkbeck running, safe and secure, and\n          able to support our staff and students in their work and study.         \n                                                                                  \n          Student Recruitment                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          How and in what way student recruitment would be impacted by the pandemic during 2020/21\n          was a worrying question for all higher education institutions – but for Birkbeck particularly, given\n          our very different demographic. Some of that difference seemed to offer cause for optimism, but\n          in other areas deep concern. We modelled scenarios from a sharp decline to somewhere near\n          the status quo of previous years. The immediate outcome was both surprising and positive.\n          Applications reached their highest ever level, totalling 21,148. New admissions totalled 4,819\n          FTE, the highest for a decade.                                          \n          There were three of factors driving this result. Whilst for many the pandemic disrupted careers,\n          livelihoods and businesses for others it also created time and opportunity to return to study.\n          Many mature learners thinking about when to study, clearly brought forward and committed to\n          those plans in 2020/21. There was also a significant EU effect with a rush to start programmes\n          before the right to loan funding was removed. 2020/21 will be the final year that EU students will\n          receive financial support for their studies. Whilst it was a pleasure to welcome EU students in\n          numbers after a notable tailing off following the Referendum result, we fully expect recruitment to\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

Finally, we introduced a range of Masters courses with a later\n          January start date to provide prospective students with greater choice and flexibility. These were\n          well received and successful, accounting for around 100 FTE.            \n                                                                                  \n          However, it is now clear from recruitment in 2021/22, which has dipped significantly, that, for\n          Birkbeck, the impact of Covid is playing out over not one but two and possibly more recruitment\n          cycles. The latent demand fulfilled in 2020/21 has bolstered numbers in that year but seen them\n          reduce in 2021/22. Whilst the impact of the funding changes for EU students was generally\n          understood the ongoing pandemic has also led to changes in applicant behaviour. Improving\n          student recruitment from the EU is a focus for us in the next few years.\n          Finally, the pandemic has significantly intensified the competition for students in London. As\n          circumstances have unfolded the largest institutions have been presented with the opportunity to\n          significantly increase recruitment and have stuck to this strategy. Other institutions are\n          competing under increasing pressure in this context. Birkbeck’s mature and commuter student\n          focus is now the locus of intense competition. The imperative of responding strongly and\n          effectively to this reality is a key part of both our longer-term strategic thinking and our\n          immediate in-year planning.                                             \n                                                                                  \n          Teaching and learning                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          Having quickly dealt with the immediate issues brought about by lockdown we developed a\n          Teaching Preparation Project (TPP) lead by the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education) with support from\n          the ITS Digital Education Team. It was clear to us that irrespective of how other universities\n          approached the Autumn term we would need to consider the unique make up of our student\n          body whilst being flexible enough to be able to quickly respond to changing government\n          guidelines.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n          Our objective for 2020/21 was to ensure that all students would be able to complete the whole\n          year of their studies remotely if circumstances required it. The TPP project was a sustained\n          institution-wide endeavour, delivered at pace and under a high degree of time and resource\n          pressure. During the year 1,200 teaching modules were transformed for online delivery. Training\n          and support was provided to 700 staff who were the front-line for this work.\n          The move online was not a move to isolated individual study. Our model of higher education is\n          not that. It centres on strong engagement between our staff and students in the classroom and\n          strong peer to peer engagement between students as part of a positive learning community.\n          Whilst we created digital content in new forms, a key part of our activity was to create the virtual\n          classrooms that could continue to bring people together to learn and study, cutting through the\n          isolation of the pandemic. Complimentary work was undertaken to support online assessment\n          and examinations so students could continue to not only study but progress towards their\n          intended qualifications. Exam hall anxiety was also reduced via online and remote examinations\n          with submission windows of between 6 and 72 hours. Careful assessment design ensured\n          academic standards were maintained and international students could study and be assessed\n          across time zones. Regular student surveys throughout the year indicated widespread support for\n          the College’s timely, inclusive and pragmatic approach.                 \n                                                                                  \n          Whilst the vast majority of teaching and assessment was successfully delivered online during\n          2020/21, not everything can be done in this way. The College moved quickly to ensure essential\n          access to teaching laboratories for students and access to the library were made available when\n          it was safe to do so.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

The policy ensured that students who attempted assessment and submitted on time\n          were not disadvantaged by completing assessment during the period of Covid disruption and\n          they did not need to submit a mitigating circumstances claim. The widespread stress and\n          disruption was taken into account throughout the whole of our assessment and examining\n          process. Students unable to complete an assessment, or who considered that their performance\n          suffered as a direct result of significant personal or family illness, bereavement or serious\n          personal, emotional or financial challenges, were able to submit a mitigating circumstances\n          claim for sympathetic consideration by assessment boards.               \n          We have also recognised that some of our students would not have access to suitable\n          workspaces nor adequate digital hardware, software or skills. As well as opening up the library to\n          support self-study as soon as possible, we made available funds to support students with\n          financial hardship to purchase suitable IT equipment. To help transition new students to the\n          world of on-line study and to maintain the services that current students need, we introduced a\n          range of training sessions, support and orientation events. Outside of the classroom, investments\n          were made in advice, mental health and student counselling as well as in the availability of\n          e-books and learning resources to support the online offer.             \n                                                                                  \n          Although many of these interventions were developed to facilitate the move to on-line learning\n          the rates of take-up may confirm that our busy commuter students are looking for on-demand\n          services that wrap around work, caring and study time.                  \n                                                                                  \n          Research                                                                \n                                                                                  \n          The completion of the institutional submission for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) is\n          always a major strategic undertaking for any research-intensive institution such as Birkbeck – let\n          alone in the midst of a pandemic. The work in support of REF has been led by the Pro- Vice-\n          Chancellor (Research) and involved major contributions of time and effort from some 113\n          colleagues across the College.                                          \n          Whilst the results of the REF can never be taken for granted, I am pleased to report that we have\n          made a strong submission, reflecting the strength, breadth, and depth of our research across all\n          disciplines. The later point is important. In line with the ambition we laid out after the 2014 REF,\n          the College returned 100% of our 461 eligible staff to the exercise. This compared with 82% in\n          the 2014 return. We made returns in 15 Units of Assessment, including two entered jointly with\n          UCL.                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          After the 2014 REF submission the College made changes to our research support structures to\n          build for the 2021 submission. As a result, we have made progress in growing our external\n          research income. Our grants portfolio - the total value of active awards - is the largest it has ever\n          been at £56 million, compared to £44 million at this point in the 2014 cycle. The College’s\n          success rate in grant applications is impressive, despite the intense competition for funding –\n          36% for the last year for which full data is available.                 \n                                                                                  \n          The pandemic has restricted movement within the UK and abroad and many of our portfolio of\n          research projects were placed on hold with funding bodies agreeing to no cost extensions. This\n          has reduced the external research income recorded in our financial statements this year\n          although the contribution to overheads is broadly similar to last year. \n                                                                                  \n          We have sought to minimise disruption. We re-opened our research laboratories as soon as it\n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 11",

In September, subject to Covid safety rules, staff could access their offices\n          once again for material and resources vital for their research. Although international travel was\n          restricted throughout the year, other activities such as participant testing began taking place\n          once again.                                                             \n          We have recognised that the disruption to research has impacted significantly on those at the\n          start on their research careers and on women. We increased the size of our internal Research\n          Innovation Fund as a way to support early career researchers. Academic colleagues have been\n          able to access the fund for a range of needs, including the costs of childcare and to assist with\n          their research during the second wave of coronavirus infections. We have also taken steps to\n          mitigate Covid impacts in our promotion processes.                      \n                                                                                  \n          Supporting staff                                                        \n                                                                                  \n          We worked with our trade union colleagues to successfully launch a Jobs Protection Scheme in\n          August 2020. The scheme focused on teaching and scholarship staff who lost some or part of\n          their teaching for the 2020/21 academic year. The scheme included secondment opportunities\n          to roles such as Digital Education Associates and redeployment options. We increased our focus\n          on health and wellbeing in order to do our best to support our staff in a holistic way during the\n          pandemic providing more support to address additional needs. We supported staff with school\n          age children by encouraging line managers to offer flexible hours and remove any non-urgent\n          work.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College acknowledged that staff had been challenged in different ways by working from\n          home, so we supported management to improve the working from home experience (for those\n          able to work from home). We liaised with the College Health and Safety Advisor about virtual DSE\n          assessments and took particular care for staff deemed clinically extremely vulnerable and\n          introduced Occupational Health assessments for such staff to determine their suitability for\n          returning to work on campus and for reasonable adjustments for staff with disabilities. We also\n          made limited work spaces available at the College. In recognition of the critical Birkbeck workers\n          required to work on site during the three periods of lockdown between March 2020 and April\n          2021, we introduced a disruption allowance. We produced bespoke guidance for managers and\n          staff on returning to work on campus and developed two online training sessions providing\n          guidance, context and frameworks for managers needing to support their direct reports to be\n          able to return to work on campus.                                       \n          Regular communications in Inside the Birkbeck Community about health and wellbeing included\n          details of the newly appointed Employee Assistance Programme, yoga and stretch sessions, and\n          other valuable resources for support.                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The development of the estate                                           \n                                                                                  \n          This year I am pleased to report that the College completed two keynote estate developments –\n          again achieved against the backdrop of Covid disruption. They go to the heart of our mission –\n          support for the highest quality research and support for our students and the best conditions for\n          teaching and learning.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Wohl Wolfson ToddlerLab will enable researchers to track childhood development seamlessly\n          over the first five years of life and will look for ways that conditions such as autism and ADHD can\n          be discovered earlier. Linked to the work of our existing BabyLab, the ToddlerLab is the first\n          centre of its kind in the world. The new building spans five floors and houses a virtual reality\n          environment, a pre-school environment, a home front-room environment, and ‘the Exploration\n          Lab’, a suite dedicated to developing behavioural interventions.        \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

Set over seven storeys, the building-\n          provides a range of teaching, learning and social spaces including: classrooms; a student lounge\n          and café; and social learning areas. It also has a striking 180-seat copper clad lecture theatre\n          with terrace at roof level. It has also been designed and fitted out to a high standard with the\n          latest IT and AV equipment. It is a clear statement of intent in terms of the facilities we are\n          committed to providing for our students.                                \n          Finally, I am pleased to report that just prior to the end of the financial year we successfully\n          acquired the Student Central Building on a 99-year lease. Student Central is next door to our\n          main Malet Street building so it provides a transformational opportunity to improve and increase\n          our teaching, learning and student social and communal space at the heart of our campus in\n          Bloomsbury. It will increase our campus space by around 25%, it will enable students to connect,\n          engage and participate inside and outside classrooms in ways in which we have not been able to\n          facilitate in the past, allowing them to maximise the benefit from their time with us.\n                                                                                  \n          Current Operating Position                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Whilst the financial results for 2020/21 are positive, and certainly far better than our initial\n          forecasting and scenario planning suggested, it is important to reflect on the fact that the\n          pandemic also interrupted the second year of the College recovery plan. \n                                                                                  \n          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since\n          2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off\n          equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of\n          £5.0 million in 2018/19. Whilst the College returned to a £1.9 million underlying surplus in\n          2019/20, some £1.4 million was attributable to reduced expenditure through the initial months\n          of the pandemic.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with\n          turnover of £100 to £250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we\n          are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost\n          pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and\n          student body adds major complexity and constraint to our underlying business model. Provision\n          at the heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue\n          other activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity to limited\n          hours in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be\n          addressed.                                                              \n          The impact of lower student income following Brexit and increased competition across London,\n          together with higher staff costs have significantly impacted our financial position. Annual\n          increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and\n          pension costs) exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the\n          fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of\n          5% of income eroded post-Brexit but without significant remedial action these deficits will grow\n          as the gap between staff costs and tuition income widens.               \n                                                                                  \n          Looking Forward                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          The College will endorse a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26 this year. This will take us to,\n          and through, our 200th anniversary. It will pick up the difficult challenges we faced prior to the\n          pandemic as well as build on the lessons learnt and strides forward we have made in responding\n          to it. It builds on spring and summer Governors’ discussions, a positive and extensive internal\n          consultation process involving staff and students, and a concerted analysis of Birkbeck’s position\n          in the sector and the London HE market.                                 \n                                      Page 13",

The strategy proposes to re-\n          establish clear ground for Birkbeck as the standout institution for highly flexible, high quality\n          teaching which delivers lifelong learning and supports social mobility. The quality of our teaching\n          will be reinforced by targeted investment in our world-leading research areas and a renewed\n          ‘connected campus’ environment which will instil a sense of pride and belonging in staff and\n          students.                                                               \n          Delivering this repositioning will involve a fundamental revision of our underlying operational and\n          teaching delivery models, creating the greater degree of standardisation in mode of teaching\n          delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and support\n          student success: addressing competitiveness will also involve the major efficiency gains that are\n          necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.               \n                                                                                  \n          With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22, Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges\n          which make the route to these strategic objectives narrower and steeper. We are identifying the\n          immediate actions whose delivery can be geared in such a way as to deliver significant short-\n          term gains in terms of efficiency and income generation. These actions are being drawn together\n          in a short-term recovery plan nested within the overall 2021-26 strategy and constituting the first\n          stages of strategy implementation.                                      \n                                                                                  \n          This plan focuses on the following interlocking initiatives:            \n                                                                                  \n                •  an immediate building back of recruitment in 2022/23, involving not only some\n                   changes in tactics and management of the campaign, but also change in our\n                   student facing offer;                                          \n                                                                                  \n                •  the launch of a more competitive flexible Birkbeck offer, in particular at\n                   undergraduate level, for autumn 2023 entry;                    \n                                                                                  \n                •  the rollout of new simplified teaching models for undergraduate and postgraduate\n                   provision that are both more effective and efficient;          \n                •  support for departmental workload models that allow the College to address issues\n                   and mismatches of workload and resource equitably; and         \n                                                                                  \n                •  optimising the support students get outside the classroom by reviewing and\n                   restructuring across the board arrangements for student facing administration\n                   services and support.                                          \n                                                                                  \n          2022 is set to be a challenging year in delivering the above, but also potentially a foundational\n          one.

It is pleasing to be able to report that\n          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various\n          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards and honours\n          received during the year.                                               \n          The 2020 European Criminology Award of the European Society of Criminology for lifetime\n          contribution to criminology was awarded to Professor Mike Hough, Emeritus Professor, School of\n          Law for his significant contribution to European criminology. The European Society of Criminology\n          (ESC) is a scientific institution founded under the Literary and Scientific Institutions Act 1854 and\n          has as one of its objectives: to foster criminological scholarship, research, education and training\n          within academic institutions.                                           \n                                                                                  \n          Professor Hough was also the recipient of this year’s Outstanding Achievement award from the\n          British Society of Criminology (BSC) in recognition of his long contribution to bringing academic\n          and policy research together. He founded one of the major UK centres for academic policy\n          research on criminal justice - the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research (ICPR) which is now\n          part of the Birkbeck Law School – and served as its Director for more than 20 years before\n          retiring recently. Prior to joining academia in 1994 he was a senior researcher in the Home\n          Office.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Professor Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck, was\n          awarded the Royal Astronomical Society’s Service Award for his leading role in the promotion of\n          lunar science and human space exploration both within the UK and internationally. Professor\n          Crawford has had a long and illustrious career in the field championing the need for deeper\n          research into the Moon at a time when it was not at the forefront of scientists’ interests. Over the\n          past 20 years he has been involved in developing science planning for space mission designs\n          such as the UK MoonLITE, ESA MoonNext and the International Lunar Network proposals.\n          Professor Crawford has also played a leading role in several lunar scientific experiments and has\n          supervised 11 PhD theses in lunar science and astrobiology. Many of his students have gone on\n          to play leading roles in the science community. In August 2020 Professor Crawford was also\n          appointed as a member of the UK Space Agency’s Space Exploration Advisory Committee.\n          Professor Sanjib Bhakta, Professor of Molecular Microbiology and Biochemistry, and Sreyashi\n          Basu were jointly awarded the 2020 Microbiology Outreach Prize by the Microbiology Society, for\n          effectively bridging the gap between laboratory science and public health research with their\n          project ‘Joi Hok!’, a community tuberculosis (TB) awareness programme. The programme’s aim is\n          to alter the perception of TB among the local community in Kolkata, India, through a network of\n          local artists, musicians and health professionals. Traditional art forms and music are used to\n          communicate knowledge of TB, educating young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds\n          about the disease through workshops which take place in semi urban and rural schools. The\n          Microbiology Society is a membership charity for scientists interested in microbes, their effects\n          and their practical uses, and is one of the largest microbiology societies in Europe.\n                                                                                  \n          Professor Kevin Ibeh, Professor of Marketing and International Business and Pro Vice-Chancellor\n          (International) at Birkbeck was appointed a Commissioner of the Commonwealth Scholarship\n          Commission (CSC), an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Foreign,\n          Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).

We remain committed to further progress on equal pay and have set out both an action\n          plan and monitoring targets.                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 16",

We operate\n          a number of contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different conditions\n          required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to demonstrate\n          excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal circumstances and all\n          members of the committees tasked with reviewing applications undertake both formal equality &\n          diversity and unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is annually reviewed by the College\n          for equality & diversity issues in application and success rates.       \n                                                                                  \n          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in\n          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal\n          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the\n          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted\n          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena\n          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the\n          academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application\n          and promotion rate of women to more senior academic roles. Work continues on this issue.\n                                                                                  \n          The College Equal Pay Audit 2020 examines gender but also includes analyses of pay gaps by\n          ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation.

Facility time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the\n          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when\n          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open\n          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 17",

Last year was\n          no different, despite volunteering initiatives being provided exclusively on-line. 460 students\n          (2019/20: 515 students) benefited from the support, guidance and advice given by 268\n          volunteers (2019/20: 324 volunteers) who gave a total of 4,500 hours of their time (2019/20:\n          5,050 hours).                                                           \n          Whilst the pandemic has caused adverse circumstances and uncertainty for so many of our\n          students, staff, alumni and donors, it has shown the real and pressing need for flexible support.\n          We are confident that our community will continue to come together to provide vital funding and\n          expertise to ensure that Birkbeck students and researchers continue to have access to the tools,\n          support and services that enable them to thrive.                        \n                                                                                  \n          As we move towards our 200th anniversary in 2023, our alumni and supporters will be vital in\n          helping us to achieve our ambitious strategic priorities. Hundreds have already shown their\n          support by engaging with the #OurBirkbeck initiative, launched last year to celebrate and\n          showcase the impact members of our community have around the world.     \n                                                                                  \n          In December 2021, Birkbeck will launch The World Needs More Birkbeck, a comprehensive\n          fundraising and engagement campaign. The Campaign will look to deepen our relationships with\n          current supporters and attract new donors to support Birkbeck's ambitions across four key areas;\n          widening access to education; supporting our students; advancing world-leading research; and\n          ensuring state-of-the-art infrastructure and estates.                   \n                                                                                  \n          As the new academic year begins I am pleased to reflect on the remarkable ways in which the\n          College community has worked together to support each other to address and overcome the\n          unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that Covid has presented over the past year and a\n          half or so. There will undoubtedly continue to be many more challenges ahead as we look to\n          bounce back from the fall in student numbers in the second year of the pandemic. Birkbeck, like\n          other Universities up and down the country, has been through a tumultuous period caused by the\n          pandemic.                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 20",

As we move into a post-pandemic,\n          post-Brexit world and approach our third century we will continue to offer transforming\n          educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial, practical or\n          otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will work closely with employers and\n          government to assist with the up-skilling and re-skilling of individuals which will be vital to the\n          recovery of the regional and national economy. Within an increasingly volatile operating\n          environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and contribution to\n          science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all of our\n          activities.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Professor David S.

The principal activities undertaken by the Group (which includes the\n          College and a wholly owned subsidiary) are teaching and research together with ancillary\n          activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include rendering academic services to\n          a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations.           \n                                                                                  \n          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of\n          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in\n          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard\n          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,\n          has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are\n          prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed\n          assets and derivative financial instruments).                           \n          The Covid pandemic has had a significant effect on families, businesses and economies across\n          the world. Education has been curtailed during the period of lockdown and examinations have\n          been severely disrupted. This has led to direct and indirect financial consequences for UK\n          universities including Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.\n                                                                                  \n          At the start of the pandemic we acknowledged that the virus would create disruption and\n          uncertainty so adapted both the management accounts for the year and the future forecasts.\n          Although focus would need to be shifted to dealing with the immediate issues thrown up by the\n          pandemic it was also important to maintain progress against towards our longer-term objectives.\n          This Financial Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial impact of\n          the pandemic.

      "text": "Birkbeck, University of London                                          \n          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    \n                                                                                  \n          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            \n                                                                                  \n          The recurrent teaching grant from the government has been falling steadily since undergraduate\n          tuition fees were increased in 2012 and fell by a further £0.3 million in 2020/21. Teaching grant\n          now represents only 3.6% of College income in comparison with 47.5% in 2005/06. The Office\n          for Students has removed the London weighting element from the grant for 2021/22 as\n          government funding priorities were shifted to support their levelling up agenda. This will almost\n          halve the teaching grant the College will receive in 2021/22 in comparison with 2020/21.\n          In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to 63.7% in 2020/21.\n          Tuition income rose by £8.0 million in 2020/21 compared with the previous year, a direct\n          consequence of the pandemic which led to significant increases in Home students and the final\n          year of UK government funded loans for students from the European Union. Although\n          applications from international students remained buoyant (up 9.4% on the previous year), Covid\n          travel restrictions limited enrolments to a 3.0% rise. Unfortunately, the Covid and Brexit spikes of\n          2020/21 appear not to have been replicated in 2021/22 despite a similar total number of\n          applications being received. This is discussed further in the Risk Management section.\n                                                                                  \n          Recurrent grant from Research England rose by £1.2 million in 2020/21, an increase of 11.9%.\n          External research activity remained affected by the pandemic restrictions and we were unable to\n          recognise income from research grants and contracts to the same extent as in previous years\n          with a further fall of £0.1 million compared with 2019/20. Research students have also\n          struggled to complete their fieldwork and the College has committed to match the approach of\n          research councils by providing financial support to those self-funding students needing to extend\n          their programmes by a year.                                             \n                                                                                  \n          Whilst the majority of academic and professional support staff across the College were able to\n          work from home successfully a small number of research, nursery, cleaning and facilities staff\n          could not. These staff were furloughed but continued to receive full salary. In line with the\n          guidelines for universities £539,000 (2019/20: £350,000) was claimed from the Coronavirus\n          Job Retention Scheme as a contribution towards the salaries of the furloughed staff. This is\n          included in Other Income.                                               \n          As an evening provider of higher education Birkbeck rents much of its space to other universities\n          during the daytime and rents space from them in the evening to support the teaching of its own\n          students. With lockdown and ongoing safety restrictions limiting the activities which could take\n          place on campus throughout the year, we saw a further fall in Other Income from £11.8 million in\n          2018/19 (the last full year pre-pandemic) to £8.2 million in 2020/21 (having removed the\n          income from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme received this year). This fall in income was\n          primarily related to a decrease in room bookings income (£2.6 million below £2018/19),\n          catering and conferences (£1.2 million below 2018/19).                  \n                                                                                  \n          In July 2021 the College sold its share of University Square Stratford to the University of East\n          London (UEL) for £5.8 million resulting in a profit on sale of asset of £3.7 million. It had become\n          increasingly clear to us that our outreach activities in the London Borough of Newham could be\n          delivered successfully without the need to own property in the area. As the majority user of the\n          Stratford property, UEL were keen to expand their programme offering into the space previously\n          used by Birkbeck and offered to buy our share.                          \n                                                                                  \n          Governors finalised a new investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support our core\n          business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our estates\n          strategy. It also includes the College's approach to Responsible Investment. Independent advice\n          on investment manager selection, which particularly focussed on Environmental, Social and\n          Governance criteria, was provided by Mercer and in the autumn of 2020 our investment funds\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 24",

After much lobbying by the College since the undergraduate fee was increased in\n          2012, we welcomed the Government’s announcement in October 2020 that it is to create a new\n          four-year lifelong learning allowance and to provide loans for students to cover the fees of\n          studying on short courses. We continue to reinforce the need to abolish the rule that prevents\n          someone from studying a higher education qualification that is at the same level or lower than\n          those that they already have (ELQ). Re-skilling and up-skilling of the UK workforce will be critical\n          for post-pandemic, post-Brexit economic recovery.                       \n          Our strategy to introduce full-time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be\n          seen in Chart 5. More recently, we enhanced our access routes to higher education for students\n          without traditional qualifications by introducing a degree with foundation year route. Recruitment\n          increased dramatically again in 2020/21 (up 288 FTE) giving students an opportunity to\n                                      Page 25",

The removal of these loans requires EU domiciled students to\n          fund their programmes at the point of study and has led to a further significant fall in numbers\n          starting programmes at Birkbeck in 2021/22.                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                   Year-on-year change  in student numbers   by                   \n                                                                                  \n                            domicile post-referendum                              \n                                                                                  \n                      400                                                         \n            )ETF(                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n            srebmun                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n            tnedutS                                                               \n                      300                                                         \n                      200                                                         \n                      100                                                         \n                        0                                                         \n                     (100)                                                        \n                     (200)                                                        \n                     (300)                                                        \n                     (400)                                                        \n                     (500)                                                        \n                             Home students   EU students International students   \n              2015/16 to 2016/17 (86)          (56)           (13)                \n              2016/17 to 2017/18 (111)         (379)          43                  \n              2017/18 to 2018/19 102           (205)          67                  \n              2018/19 to 2019/20 76            (16)           39                  \n              2019/20 to 2020/21 355           146            14                  \n          Chart 6: Impact of Brexit on recruitment of students from the EU        \n          In 2016/17, postgraduate recruitment showed a marked increase (Chart 5) due to the\n          introduction of the postgraduate loan. Full-time numbers then fell slightly in 2017/18, partly due\n          to the fall in EU students but also due to increased competition as more institutions advertised\n          the new student loan which had originally been announced close to the start of the 2016/17\n          academic year. Recruitment has increased steadily since then with postgraduate enrolments in\n          2019/20 representing an increase of 30.6% over 2015/16 which was the final year pre-loans.\n          Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this\n          occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown\n          restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters\n          programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to\n          upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-\n          Brexit) recovery. Unfortunately, far lower 2021/22 recruitment appears to indicate that latent\n          demand was met last year possibly coupled with a focus on employment rather than study as\n          London begins to recover.                                               \n                                      Page 26",

Income from\n          international students rose by £0.9 million (an increase of 9.4%) despite the considerable travel\n          challenges faced by many students during 2020/21. International student income has steadily\n          grown over the last five years as we have placed more emphasis on international brand\n          management and awareness. We believe that there is scope for further increases, particularly\n          with the re-introduction of the post-study work visa. Income from part-time students rose by £2.1\n          million – the third year-on-year increase since the dramatic fall in numbers from 2012.

With undergraduate fees fixed by the UK government and upwards\n          pressure on staff costs, particularly through pension contribution increases, there is a mismatch\n          between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff costs. Until 2017/18, the\n          trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs and the College\n          delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit fall in students enrolling from the EU coupled with\n          increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 9 and directly led to the\n          underlying deficit in 2018/19. In 2019/20, lower staff costs following the VSER scheme coupled\n          with increased student income brought the two lines closer together and we have seen a\n          significant switch in 2020/21 due to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition income.\n          Unfortunately, as we ease our way out of the pandemic new student enrolments have fallen and\n          the implications of a switch back to staff costs exceeding tuition income in 2021/22 needs\n          careful consideration as we develop our new five-year strategy.         \n          The coronavirus pandemic required us to quickly move activity on-line for both staff and students\n          in the Spring of 2020 and education remained largely on-line throughout 2020/21. When\n          College buildings began to open in-line with government guidelines, most staff and students\n          continued to work remotely. Despite the significant changes the transition was successful and we\n          saw an increase in student retention in 2020/21. However, both income and costs were\n          affected. It is difficult to ascertain exactly what the financial impact in 2020/21 has been but a\n          comparison of performance against the original underlying break-even budget for various\n          activities can provide some indicators.                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 29",

Although costs were lower, the savings\n          were not directly related to the delivery of teaching with staff costs exceeding budget due to\n          investment in staff to support the on-line development and delivery of programmes.\n          In addition, we had three very specific material adjustments which helped boost the\n          comprehensive income by £10.6 million: a one-off property sale; growth in investments from an\n          initial pandemic fall in global equities; plus £2.3 million in donations which were received over\n          the last few years but under accounting rules could only be recorded as income once our specific\n          obligations had been delivered (completion of Toddlerlab and 373 Euston Road).\n                                                                                  \n          The comprehensive income achieved in 2020/21 of £18.0 million is not dissimilar to the\n          2019/20 figure of £19.0 million. However, it is important to look beyond these figures to the\n          major contributing factors as shown in Table5.                          \n                                                                                  \n                                              2020/21   2019/20                   \n                                                 (£m)      (£m)                   \n                                                                                  \n           Estimate of “business as usual” surplus 3.8     0.4                    \n           Estimated Covid impact*                3.9      1.4                    \n           Pension adjustment                     0.1      15.1                   \n           Profit on sale of University Square Stratford 3.7 -                    \n           Gain on investments                    3.3      0.4                    \n           Release of capital donations           2.3        -                    \n           Other                                  0.9      1.7                    \n                                                                                  \n           Sub total income                      18.0      19.0                   \n          Table 5: Key factors contributing to surplus 2020/21 and 2019/20        \n                                                                                  \n          * It should be noted that nearly all of our activities were impacted by Covid during 2020/21 so it is\n          difficult to accurately assess the direct financial impact. The Covid estimate is the sum of the first five\n          entries in Table 4 to give a guide but the figure could easily be higher.\n                                                                                  \n          Although difficult to ascertain exactly, it does appear that our underlying financial position\n          continued to improve in 2020/21 from the post-referendum lows. However, the pandemic\n          prevented us from reducing costs in a couple of academic departments with particularly low staff\n          student ratios and this will need to be a focus in 2021/22.             \n          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2017 with the effect\n          that the scheme deficit increased. A repayment plan was agreed in 2018/19 and the College\n          recognised the increase in its share of the pension liability. This had the effect of reducing total\n          comprehensive income for the year by £20.7 million. A joint Expert Panel (JEP) was set up with\n          members representing employers and members to review the assumptions used in the valuation.\n          A follow up valuation was undertaken at 31 March 2018 using slightly amended assumptions\n          recommended by the JEP. These assumptions led to a reduction in the scheme deficit and a\n          recovery plan with a slightly extended repayment period. The resulting impact on the College total\n          comprehensive income was an increase of £14.9 million.                  \n                                                                                  \n          It was agreed that a third valuation at 31 March 2020 should be undertaken and this was\n          commenced despite the pandemic impact on equities. The valuation increased the deficit\n          position significantly to retain existing retirement benefits and contribution rates would have\n          moved to unaffordable levels to repair the position. Benefit reforms were proposed which only\n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 31",

From April 2022 the employer contribution rate will increase to 23.7% (an\n          additional 2.3%) and members 11.0% (an additional 1.2%). If benefit reform is not implemented\n          by 2025 the corresponding rates will be set at 38.2% for employers and 18.8% for members.\n          Without benefit reform the College share of the liability at 31 July 2022 is estimated to be £78.5\n          million.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n          The University and Colleges Union (UCU) balloted for strike action over pay and pensions and is\n          asking employers not to implement benefit reforms. Although most employers, including\n          Birkbeck, have stated that they cannot afford to increase contribution rates further the Pensions\n          Regulator has clearly stated that it expects the 2020 valuation to be concluded as it is already\n          past the statutory deadline. Given the affordability challenge for employers and the pressure\n          from the regulator it is difficult to see how a negotiated settlement could be reached with UCU\n          before April 2022.                                                      \n          As can be seen from Table 6, the Universities Superannuation Scheme has become more costly\n          and represented 7.1% of income in 2020/21 (6.6% of total income 2017/18). Deficit recovery\n          contributions of 6.3% of payroll are now required and the College share of the liability has\n          increased by £37.8 million in four years. It is hoped that possible strike action will not lead to the\n          imposition of further rate increases from April 2022 and that ways to ensure that the scheme\n          becomes financially sustainable are identified before the 2023 valuation. Governors are\n          concerned about the risk the scheme now places on the financial health of the College.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 32",

Staff costs inflate each year due to pay inflation, incremental drift and\n          promotions with National Insurance and pension contribution increases also adding to the\n          pressure. The challenge of managing rising costs with a fixed annual income is a cycle we need\n          to try and break.                                                       \n          The increased total comprehensive income in 2020/21 contributed £10.9 million in operating\n          cash (2019/20: £2.3 million). This cash inflow coupled with cash reserves allowed us to\n          purchase Student Central (now referred to as Birkbeck Central) from the University of London for\n          £35 million. The purchase of Birkbeck Central coupled with continued investment in other capital\n          estates projects, IT infrastructure and equipment has led to a significant increase in non-current\n          assets and a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents. Net liquidity days fell this\n          year to 50 (in highly simplistic terms the number of days we can pay for goods and services\n          without further income). It is worth noting, however, that in addition to the instant access cash we\n          also held £23.4 million of long-term investments – invested in two funds with Mercer and Ruffer.\n          Each of these funds generate investment income and are reasonably liquid (7 days).\n                                                                                  \n          Having used our cash reserves to invest in fixed assets the ratio of long-term investments to total\n          investments has nearly doubled this year to 62.2% (2019/20: 32.7%). It is helpful that the long-\n          term investments can be readily divested and our cash flows are constantly monitored. In\n          October 2021 the College Investment Committee chose to realise the gains made on the funds\n          and reduced the capital invested back to £20 million.                   \n                                                                                  \n          To help manage our liquidity in the period following the purchase of Birkbeck Central, and to\n          contribute towards the costs of refurbishment, a £20 million Revolving Credit Facility was\n          arranged with Barclays Bank prior to 31 July 2021. At the year-end it had not been necessary to\n          draw down any of the loan funding.                                      \n                                                                                  \n          Risk Management                                                         \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n                                                                                  \n          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to\n          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit\n          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key\n          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main\n          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        \n                                                                                  \n          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and\n          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,\n          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The\n          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual\n          report on internal control and risk for 2020/21 was presented to the Audit Committee in May\n          2021.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          In the Spring of 2020, KPMG undertook a scheduled review of strategic risk management at the\n          College as part of their internal audit plan for the year.

Although the risk level has not changed\n               across the last two years we have seen a marked change in applicant behaviour. We were\n               concerned that recruitment for 2020/21 would fall due to travel and other restrictions\n               related to the pandemic but this did not materialise and we saw a spike in enrolments.\n               Having modelled flat year-year-on-year recruitment of new students for 2021/22 we\n               retained the risk level due to ongoing pandemic uncertainty.       \n               Despite receiving the same number of applications in both 2020/21 and 2021/22,\n               conversion from offer to enrolment dropped significantly this year such that tuition\n               income is expected to be around £10 million below budget. In the first half of the\n               recruitment cycle applications were up year-on-year but late summer applications from\n               more mature students, usually our strongest recruitment period, fell away significantly.\n               The continuing use of teacher assessed A levels polarised the sector with Russell Group\n               universities increasing numbers at the expense of others with very few students needing\n               to accept their insurance offers.                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Work has already commenced to boost our marketing and conversion activity for\n               2022/23 and longer-term recovery strategies are being developed.

The significant drop in\n               conversion in 2021/22 has led to a £10 million loss of income against an underlying\n               provisional surplus for the year of £1.0 million. A number of early reductions to\n               expenditure budgets have been identified which reduce the forecast underlying deficit for\n               the year to £3.0 million. Future year income will also be affected as reduced size cohorts\n               replace larger graduating groups.                                  \n               Audit Committee and Finance & General Purposes Committee reviewed a series of papers\n               in November 2021 outlining a recovery strategy and the impact of the loss of income and\n               plans of our financial forecasts. Although we can expect deficits for the next couple of\n               years the recovery strategy outlines a credible way forward which includes refocussing\n               our programme portfolio and the way we deliver teaching. These coupled objectives are\n               based on a review of internal metrics and external market data and aim to make sure\n               that we deliver high quality programmes for working students. They will also allow us to\n               build on our long-standing objective of offering a lifelong learning opportunity to students\n               needing to upskill and reskill throughout their careers.           \n                                                                                  \n               The deterioration in our financial position in 2021/22 will increase the range of risks we\n               face as we seek to quickly implement our recovery strategy. Strategic Planning\n               Committee and Governors will continue to formally review progress against timelines and\n               objectives.

Other College committees such as the Health & Safety Committee\n          have also been meeting more frequently.

The Governing Body has regard to the Charity Commission’s\n          guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in the following manner.\n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of education                                            \n                                                                                  \n          The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for\n          the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and\n          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills\n          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including\n          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and\n          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual\n          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins\n          everything we do.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in\n          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in\n          the Charities Act (see below for examples). The following table summarises our research income\n          over the last three years:                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                              2018/19   2019/20  2020/21          \n                                                                                  \n           Research income (£’000)              8,839     8,412    8,287          \n           Income as a percentage of total income 8.4%    7.7%      7.0%          \n          Table 8: Research income trends                                         \n          Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. Unfortunately, the pandemic\n          has affected the amount of research activity that could be undertaken leading to a fall in income\n          recognised over the last two years. The College currently has a portfolio of live research projects\n          linked to £56 million in external grant funding.                        \n                                                                                  \n          The pandemic also had an impact on our research students with a number having to extend their\n          research phase prior to writing up.

It also\n          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.\n          Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to\n          educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who\n          may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for\n          mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through\n          our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution\n          and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented\n          groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without\n          strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily\n          increasing to 815 FTE in 2020/21 (see Chart 5). 58% of the students are from ethnic minority\n          backgrounds (47% on our standard undergraduate programmes), 53% male (compared with\n          44%) and 35% under the age of 21 (compared with 22%). We are proud to offer an opportunity to\n          this group of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and remain committed to driving\n          this agenda in the higher education sector.                             \n                                                                                  \n          We are concerned that an outcome of the government’s review of post-18 education may\n          introduce minimum A-level standards for students under 21 whereby student loan funding is not\n          available to them if they need to undertake foundation years. Such a strategy will adversely affect\n          a large group of students who are otherwise capable of completing a university degree (albeit\n          with additional support at the outset) thereby providing themselves with an opportunity to\n          enhance their economic position. We continue to lobby strongly on this point.\n          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students\n          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from\n          ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 93%\n          of our part-time students and 67% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity\n          for students who wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore,\n          offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be able to study.\n                                                                                  \n          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have\n          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that\n          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes\n          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time\n          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and\n          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to\n          continue with our current approach on access.                           \n                                                                                  \n          Detailed information on the ways that we provide support to our students can be found in the\n          College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to 2024/25.

The project aims to address the fact that many problems of interest in\n          computer science are unlikely to be tractable, that is, easy to solve, using computational\n          methods. The research team will study query evaluation by seeking examples of computationally\n          tractable problems in the hope of better understanding the factors that determine whether a\n          problem can be solved using computational methods. The study will aim to develop complexity\n          measures for formulas that will allow for the identification of tractability results for query\n          evaluation. Findings from the research will support a much deeper and richer understanding of\n          database query evaluation and will crucially focus on efficiency, reducing costs and allowing for\n          higher capabilities in the industry.

Yamoah has received a grant from the Science and\n          Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Food Network+ to work on a project developing more\n          resilient food supply chains in Ghana. The project, Using STFC Technology to Create a Novel\n          Digital Platform to Integrate Fish Farmers and Customers in Ghana, aims to address problems in\n          the fish supply chain caused by the Covid pandemic and to improve the resilience of the supply\n          chain for the future.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          In Ghana, fish farming is a major source of nutrition and livelihood for small-scale farmers.\n          However, lockdowns prompted by the Covid pandemic have caused huge disruption to the\n          aquaculture sector, resulting in a loss of income and limited consumer access to this nutritious\n          food supply. Dr Yamoah’s project aims to address this problem by creating a digital platform that\n          will connect fish farmers with customers, addressing supply, market and transparency challenges\n          that face the aquaculture food system in Ghana. Building on contemporary food delivery systems\n          such as Uber Eats, the platform will link fish farmers with customers directly, ensuring that\n          farmers are able to access the wider market and to sell in a safe environment. Ultimately, the\n          project aims to create, harness and sustain fish supply chains in Africa for improved livelihoods,\n          nutritional outcomes and social and environmental impacts.              \n          The STFC Food Network+ brings together STFC researchers and facilities with research and\n          industry in the agri-food sector.

The\n          tougher, more arbitrary sentencing many countries have introduced have caused prison\n          populations to surge, while leaving untouched the underlying and complex drivers of much\n          offending.”.                                                            \n          The ten jurisdictions examined were Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, the USA (focusing on New York\n          State), India, Thailand, England and Wales, Hungary, the Netherlands and Australia (focusing on\n          New South Wales).                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          In a second report, the prisons research team at ICPR published research on measures taken to\n          control the risk of Covid in prisons and their impact on prisoners’ health and wellbeing. The\n          research covers a diverse group of countries across five continents and includes first-hand\n          accounts of how life in custody changed from March 2020. When the pandemic emerged, most\n          countries’ prison systems were running above their official capacity, after decades of rising\n          prisoner numbers. From early March 2020, prisons across the world quickly locked down. With\n          visits from the outside world largely suspended, prisoners were deprived of family contact, legal\n          advice, visits from voluntary agencies and monitoring bodies. Rehabilitation, work, education and\n          other activities largely ceased. Prisoners spent long periods locked up with little or no contact\n          with others.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n          Initially, the restrictions were met with protest, disorder and serious violence. Since then, with no\n          end to the pandemic in sight, this protracted ‘double lockdown’ has continued to take a heavy toll\n          on prisoners’ mental and physical health. The research shows that the health and social impacts\n          of the pandemic and the measures taken to contain it are more severe in countries with\n          overcrowded, under-resourced prisons. The risks of spread of infection are much greater in\n          prisons with limited physical space and inadequate staffing levels – conditions that also make it\n          even more difficult to maintain provision for education, work, rehabilitation, and social interaction\n          at this time of public health emergency.                                \n          Early signs are that global prisoner numbers have declined since early 2020, for several reasons\n          connected to the pandemic. Sustaining and building on these reductions is the single most\n          effective strategy to contain the public health risks presented by contagious diseases without\n          causing collateral damage to the mental and physical health of prisoners, prison staff and their\n          families.                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of health or the saving of lives                        \n                                                                                  \n          A study from The Centre for Building Resilience in Breast Cancer (BRiC) at Birkbeck has\n          demonstrated that social support and good cognitive health can protect against depression in\n          metastatic breast cancer. The research also finds that being of younger age (34-50 years) and\n          having poorer cognitive function is met with increased levels of post-traumatic stress in this\n          population. The study, using a sample of 59 women over the past year, is the first to examine the\n          link between cognitive function and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress\n          in metastatic breast cancer patients.                                   \n                                                                                  \n          It is believed that around 30% of women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer go on to\n          develop metastatic breast cancer, also known as secondary breast cancer or stage IV breast\n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 40",

Recent research shows that depression can escalate\n          cancer progression and increase the risk of cancer specific mortality by 30% in breast cancer\n          (Wang et al., 2020). Despite this evidence, there is little to hardly any research that addresses\n          the emotional and cognitive needs of women with metastatic breast cancer leaving them highly\n          under-represented in research.                                          \n          In the current study, women with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer completed a series of\n          online questionnaires and cognitive tests to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and\n          cognitive function. The results, published in the journal Psycho-Oncology, demonstrated that\n          younger women who reported poorer levels of cognitive functioning were at greatest risk of\n          increased post-traumatic stress symptoms. When looking at the role of social support, the\n          authors found that the combined effect of social support and good cognitive function could\n          protect against depression symptoms in metastatic breast cancer patients.\n                                                                                  \n          A second BRiC study also found evidence that job insecurity created by Covid can lead to greater\n          depression levels in women living with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Figures showed that job\n          security was 40% lower in women who were furloughed or unable to work as a result of the\n          outbreak compared to women who had continued working. Those with low job security scored\n          approximately 26% higher on depression than those with high job security.\n                                                                                  \n          Workability in women after breast cancer diagnosis has proven to improve cognitive and\n          emotional health as well as protect against anxiety and depression leading to a better quality of\n          life in survivorship. Work plays a central role in their recovery and provides them with a sense of\n          normality, purpose and stability after what has otherwise been a highly distressing and uncertain\n          period in their lives. Threats from Covid on job security show the psychological harm that such\n          women are exposed to, which can lead to exaggerated levels of clinical depression.\n                                                                                  \n          The study, which was based on a series of online questionnaires completed by 234 women with\n          primary breast cancer in the UK, measured the impact of Covid on perceptions of work during the\n          peak of the pandemic. The results further revealed that women who had been furloughed by an\n          employer or left unable to work as a consequence of the outbreak had significantly greater job\n          insecurity.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 41",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but\n          is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a\n          material misstatement when it exists.

The extent to which our procedures\n          are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n          Based on our understanding of the Group and the sector in which it operates, we identified that\n          the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations are related to their registration\n          with the Office for Students (\"OfS”) and their ongoing conditions of registration, and we\n          considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the Group\n          Financial Statements or their continued operation. We also considered those laws and\n          regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as compliance with the\n          OfS Accounts Direction and tax legislation.

The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit\n            requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost\n            convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).\n            The College's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and\n            position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.\n                                                                                  \n            Going Concern                                                         \n            The impact of lower student income following Brexit and increased competition across London, together\n            with higher staff costs, have significantly impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs\n            (due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and pension costs) exceed the\n            inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on\n            undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but\n            without significant remedial action these deficits will grow as the gap between staff costs and tuition\n            income widens.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n            With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22, Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges which\n            make the route to financial sustainability narrower and steeper. We are identifying the immediate actions\n            whose delivery can be geared in such a way as to deliver significant short-term gains in terms of efficiency\n            and income generation. These actions are being drawn together in a short-term recovery plan nested\n            within the overall 2021-26 strategy and constituting the first stages of strategy implementation.\n                                                                                  \n            Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income recovery and\n            efficiency savings, including stress testing. Although deficits are forecast for the next two years under the\n            mid-case scenario the forecasts indicate that cash reserves will be maintained above £20 million. The\n            forecasts assume that we will redevelop Birkbeck Central as planned but we will need to carefully consider\n            affordability. To help manage risk the decision to tender for a construction company to undertake the\n            works will be taken in November 2022 once we know the outcome of student recruitment for 2022/23\n            and progress towards cost savings targets.                            \n            Governors have reviewed the financial forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and\n            medium term recovery strategy and the risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges\n            resulting from the pandemic drop in student numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the College\n            has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, we\n            continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n       2.

Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.  \n                                                                                  \n            The financial year-end of the College's subsidiary, Cambridge House Limited, is 31 October.

Accounting for retirement benefits                                    \n            College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme\n            (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are\n            primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by\n            professionally qualified independent actuaries.                       \n            Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities\n            of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined\n            contribution retirement benefit schemes.                              \n            A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the\n            schemes.                                                              \n            Defined contribution plan                                             \n            A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the College pays fixed\n            contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further\n            amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense\n            in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                                                                                  \n            Defined benefit plan                                                  \n            Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n            defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n            employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n            returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n            the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n            plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n            employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine\n            its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed by a\n            qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n            recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either\n            through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n                                                                                  \n       5.   Employment benefits                                                   \n            Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an\n            expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are accrued\n            and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.\n                                                                                  \n       6.   Finance leases                                                        \n            Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased\n            asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the\n            corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value\n            and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.\n            Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the\n            outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce\n            a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 59",

Taxation                                                             \n             The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a\n             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is\n             potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered\n             by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of\n             Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable\n             purposes.                                                            \n             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is\n             included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their\n             cost.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n             The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial organisation.\n                                                                                  \n       17.   Reserves                                                             \n             Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances\n             which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College\n             must hold in perpetuity.                                             \n                                                                                  \n             Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,\n             therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.      \n                                                                                  \n       18.   Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n             In preparing these financial statements the College has made the following judgements:\n                                                                                  \n          a) As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is recognised as a\n             liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan agreed in the 2018\n             actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of future salaries between\n             1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each triennial valuation of the\n             scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future salary inflations, changes in\n             staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out in note 28.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 62",

It was noted that the Vice-Chancellor had\n           not made an application for any increase in remuneration in respect of the academic year 2020/21 and his\n           salary will not be subject to increase in relation to the national pay award. The Vice Chancellor’s current\n           salary reflects sustained quality and continuity of leadership over an 18 year period which has had\n           transformational impact. The College has met, managed and overcome major strategic threats - the loss of\n           40% of core teaching funding due to government policy change in 2007 and the fundamental 60% decline\n           in traditional part-time study post 2012. The College’s distinct mission stands out in the sector: widening\n           access, opportunity and flexibility for students in an environment informed by the best research. Birkbeck is\n           one of only twenty UK institutions that rate highly in both REF and TEF. Delivering successfully on its mission\n           in this environment has required the College to restructure, reposition, re-invent and innovate. The Vice\n           Chancellor’s role in delivering this change, operating in a long-standing, collegial environment and building\n           the widest base of support amongst students, staff, stakeholders and funders, has been vital to the viability\n           and success of the College.                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 66",

This is a multi-year enhancement programme, accelerated in 2020/21, with a strategic focus on enhancing\n           and expanding the digital capability and resilience of our taught portfolio. This is designed to improve student\n           retention and student success amongst a mature, part-time and commuter-based student community. Despite the\n           pandemic creating new uncertainties around student numbers plus additional pressures on the College to deliver\n           operationally during this chapter of the APP, the commitments made were achieved under the following categories.\n                                                                                  \n           Access                                                                 \n           The actual spend on Access (adults in the community) during the year was £500,000 compared with a forecast\n           investment of £381,000. We do not consider this to be a reportable variance to the Office for Student (OfS), as the\n           increase is against one line in the APP and has not reduced the commitments or support in other APP areas, as\n           there are no access deficits in our benchmark metrics. This was a proportional management response to\n           supporting some of the most vulnerable groups seeking entry into Higher Education during the pandemic.\n                                                                                  \n           The expansion of our portfolio of undergraduate Degrees with a Foundation Year contributed to the increased\n           spend and has provided supported entry opportunities in line with our widening participation mission.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 69",

We will continue to monitor the financial support commitments in the context of the ongoing pandemic and\n           the outcomes we deliver.                                               \n           Disability                                                             \n                                                                                  \n           We were not required to set a target for investment in disability. Across the 2020-2025 APP the College committed\n           to ensuring everyone who could participate was able to. This investment supported individual Study Support Plans,\n           mental health and student counsellors, as well as disability advisors. The recommendation of the SER to offer\n           more online study opportunities has resulted in a more inclusive learning environment and one that better\n           supports dyslexia and other neurodiverse conditions. The move to online and remote assessments has also\n           significantly reduced ‘exam hall anxiety’ whilst supporting attainment.\n           Research and Evaluation                                                \n           The actual spend of £121,000 in this category compares favourably with the commitment of £100,000. A key\n           deliverable in this sub-section was qualitative and quantitative research on the awarding/attainment gap between\n           student cohorts identified in the APP. A report has been produced and an implementation plan drawn up against\n           the findings. The report has been considered by Education Committee and SPC and will be presented to Academic\n           Board in academic year 2021/22. This will be used to inform further interventions in the coming period of the\n           plan.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The 2020/21 - 2024-25 Access and Participation Plan can be found here: \n           https://apis.officeforstudents.org.uk/accessplansdownloads/2024/BirbeckCollege_APP_2020-\n           21_V1_10007760.pdf                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 70",

In\n           calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the\n           duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out in note 28.\n           The USS 2020 valuation was signed with an effective date of 1 October 2021. As the valuation was signed after\n           the year-end it constitutes a non-adjusting event. Had the valuation been completed prior to the year-end this\n           would have resulted in a provision of £49.5 million, an increase of £32.7 million from the current year-end\n           provision. This increase in provision would have resulted in a higher charge to the Statement of Comprehensive\n           Income of £32.7 million giving a revised total deficit for the year of £14.7 million.\n                                                                                  \n           The 2020 valuation requires a recommended deed on benefit changes be executed by 28 February 2022.\n           Should the benefit changes not be executed by this date the liability will increase to £77.9 million for the year-\n           ended 31 July 2022.                                                    \n           See also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs.

All transactions involving related parties are conducted in accordance with\n          the College's financial regulations and procurement policies/procedures.\n          The College has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 102 and has not disclosed transactions with its wholly owned\n          subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Limited.                 \n          During the year the Group entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related parties.

The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,\n           providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme\n           are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are\n           not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore\n           exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the\n           underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by Section 28\n           of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a wholly defined\n           contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the\n           contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan)\n           that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a\n           liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit)\n           with the related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.\n                                                                                  \n           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a\n           collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a\n           scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as\n           Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has\n           entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the\n           recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they\n           relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.\n           College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-\n           employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under\n           the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 82",

At the valuation date, the value of\n           the assets of the scheme was £63.7 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £67.3\n           billion indicating a shortfall of £3.6 billion and a funding ratio of 95%.\n                                                                                  \n           In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its\n           obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).\n                                                                                  \n           The key financial assumptions used in the 2018 valuation are described below.

The 2020 valuation\n           came into effect with a dual rate schedule of contributions:           \n           - Leg 1 - includes an increase in contribution rates from the 2018 valuation and a longer deficit recovery\n             period. Deficit recovery contributions (DRC) under the 2018 valuation cease from 1 October 2021 and DRCs\n             under the 2020 valuation commence from 1 April 2022. From 1 April 2022, when the proposed benefit\n             changes are assumed to have been implemented, the DRCs are equal to 6.3% salaries and are payable for\n             the length of the recovery plan until 31 March 2038.                 \n                                                                                  \n           - Leg 2 - includes a more significant increase in contribution rates from the 2018 valuation and a shorter\n             deficit recovery period. From 1 October 2022 DRCs commence at 3% then increase every 6 months (the\n             difference between 37% required to fund future service cost and the total contributions being collected) until\n             they reach 20% at 1 October 2025. They remain at this level until 31 July 2032.

The Trustee adopts\n           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefirs\n           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued\n           pension rights to be met.                                              \n                                                                                  \n           The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events\n           turning out worse than expected.

However, market\n           movements following the valuation date were positive and the Trustee and Employers agreed to allow for\n           post-valuation experience up to 30 April 2021. As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at\n           that date, no deficit contributions were required.
