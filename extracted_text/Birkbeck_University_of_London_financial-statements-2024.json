Whilst these are challenging times for our sector and for Birkbeck, my\n          experience of this first year – the dedication of our staff and the engagement and commitment of\n          our students – has only reinforced my appreciation of the Birkbeck community and the Birkbeck\n          mission. We have moved forward this year and continue to do so through our collective effort. I\n          want, at the outset, to express my thanks to everyone who has made that possible.\n          About Birkbeck                                                          \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck is a unique London-based teaching and research institution providing access to higher\n          education for traditional and non-traditional students of all ages. Our students face the reality of\n          competing priorities and calls on their time. From 18 to 61+ (over 250 of our students were over\n          61 in 2023/24), they are living their lives with all the commitments that entails. Often, they are\n          working, have caring or other responsibilities. Our job is to make sure that in doing all that, they\n          can benefit from higher education, not miss out on it.                  \n                                                                                  \n          Our student body is diverse with 42% from ethnic minority backgrounds, 57% women and 25%\n          declaring a disability in 2023/24. As well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing\n          international student community now welcoming students from over 140 countries around the\n          world.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that\n          proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was\n          successful in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) return with 83% of our research\n          being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*).\n                                                                                  \n          Student recruitment                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          In last year’s report we highlighted that building back student recruitment would be the work of a\n          number of years, not just one or two; this remains the case.            \n          The issues across the sector in relation to international student recruitment were already\n          manifesting themselves at this point last year and we drew attention to the volatility and risk in\n          the international market. Following the significant fall in overall new admissions for 2021/22,\n          2022/23 saw no further decline in recruitment. Whilst this was positive it was achieved to a\n          significant degree by concerted and successful international recruitment. Increases in\n          international students mitigated the impact of our home recruitment position as we responded to\n          major market changes here and got underway with the significant changes needed to our overall\n          offer and the investment in the infrastructure to support new modes of delivery.\n                                                                                  \n          As we anticipated, international recruitment in 2023/24 fell back from its 2022/23 high point,\n          with 744 FTE new students compared to 1,032 FTE. This was a major contributory factor to an\n          overall reduction of new admissions from 3,540 FTE last year to 3,045 FTE this. Whilst not\n          welcome, we were able to respond to the financial impact through concerted financial\n          management and in-year adjustments to our operating budgets.            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

From offer to acceptance and then onto enrolment.   \n          We have made good progress, introducing daytime undergraduate courses in biomedicine,\n          business, health & social care, law, management and psychology alongside a suite of daytime\n          postgraduate programmes initially focused on computing & data science, management &\n          business and psychology.                                                \n                                                                                  \n          We have established new programmes in health and natural sciences plus new joint courses in\n          business, law and computing. Next year we will add further to our portfolio, focussing on the\n          environment and artificial intelligence, with that provision drawing on our discipline breadth\n          across the sciences, humanities, business and law.                      \n                                                                                  \n          Significant strides have also been made with process. The further extension of delegated\n          admissions, where offers are made centrally by our Registry admissions team, together with\n          concerted focus on remaining School-based decisions which need input from academic\n          colleagues, has resulted in far quicker offer-making feeding into faster conversion follow-up. 25%\n          of our offers for 2024/25 were made in less than a day and we have more than halved our\n          median offer time compared to 2023/24.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The actions we have been taking are having a positive impact on new enrolments for\n          programmes starting in October 2024. Whilst the challenges driving down direct international\n          recruitment have remained, the year-on-year position for new home enrolments is positive, with\n          an overall increase of 7% recorded at the end of October 2024. New home admissions to\n          undergraduate programmes which we particularly targeted for growth, have increased by 13%\n          whilst at the postgraduate master’s level the increase is 1%.           \n          In recent years we began to offer a limited number of Masters programmes with a January start\n          date and were pleased to achieve growth of 14% in Home enrolments in 2023/24. Although\n          international numbers fell year on year in this category as well, we are optimistic that further\n          growth in Home and at least no further falls in international will the outcome in 2025.\n                                                                                  \n          Growth in Home student numbers is positive news as we continue with the hard work necessary\n          to innovate our course portfolio, the way and location we deliver and teach it and how we connect\n          with the Birkbeck students of the future. This success has been achieved in an operating\n          environment in which many selective universities increased the number of Home students they\n          recruited in an attempt to offset the continuing fall in international numbers thereby putting\n          significant pressure on institutions across the sector.                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

Things change. Birkbeck students, or rather the students Birkbeck exists\n          to serve, are not ultimately defined by age; they are defined by the circumstances and the\n          struggles they face, the ambition they have, and their commitment to achieve it. Whether 18, 28,\n          or 38, we will find them. Once we do, we need to attract them with the compelling study offer that\n          fulfils that ambition, matches that commitment and fits with those circumstances.\n          International                                                           \n                                                                                  \n          In March 2024 Birkbeck commissioned Cormack Consultancy Group (CCG) to review its position\n          in the international education market and suggest possibilities for growing engagement. It\n          reported in June 2024, having considered Birkbeck’s current capabilities and potential future\n          offerings. The report highlighted that clear opportunities continue to exist for Birkbeck, both to\n          sharpen our competitiveness in direct retail recruitment and to develop more wholesale\n          recruitment through collaboration and partnership in specific regions.  \n                                                                                  \n          We have made some immediate changes to support our direct recruitment in the light of the\n          review findings whilst the volatility of the international market in terms of individual student\n          choice, has reinforced the case for the development of longer-term partnership arrangements\n          less immediately susceptible to economic and political factors and highlighted in the review. We\n          are making progress, continuing to develop our existing relationship with the UK-based\n          Cambridge Education Group, who will now provide us with pre and post sessional English\n          language support, as well as identifying priority countries for partnership arrangements in China,\n          India, Sri Lanka, and the US.                                           \n                                                                                  \n          We are building relationships with education service providers able to provide knowledge,\n          expertise and capacity to support collaboration with Chinese Universities and in particular the\n          pathway for applications to the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China for joint\n          programmes and joint institutes. These arrangements are common in Australia and becoming\n          more common in the UK. In India and Sri Lanka our strategy is to focus more on institutional\n          articulation arrangements with students entering Birkbeck year 2 to join existing programmes.\n          We believe US collaboration can provide an important route to boost humanities and social\n          science student recruitment at the post-graduate level. This involves US partners for either dual\n          degrees (a Masters degree from both higher education institution) or progression arrangements\n          (undergraduate in the US to a Masters degree at Birkbeck). Obviously, the latter is available to\n          any student from anywhere, but these arrangements offer mapped pathways with some joint or\n          online teaching on the undergraduate degree to encourage selection of the postgraduate option\n          and promotion by staff at both institutions. Term or year abroad options are attractive to US\n          students studying humanities and social sciences and we are working on this opportunity as well.\n                                                                                  \n          Current operating position                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The 2023/24 total comprehensive income for the year was £24.8 million compared with total\n          comprehensive income of £1.9 million in the previous year. However, this overall position and\n          how it relates to last year is impacted significantly by the valuation of the Universities\n          Superannuation Scheme (USS). The 2023 triennial valuation used updated long-term economic\n          assumptions to value future obligations for the scheme and determined that it was no longer in\n          deficit. The consequence is that our share of the deficit recovery plan has been released in full\n          this year reducing expenditure by £29.7 million (2022/23: a part reduction in liability of £9.5\n          million).                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 11",

This reflects the ongoing impact of student recruitment magnified by the structural\n          financial issues that are playing out across the sector (see Table 7). Annual increases in staff\n          costs - due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and pension costs -\n          exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by\n          the government on Home undergraduate tuition fees. The historic resistance by the Government\n          to increase home undergraduate tuition fees has affected the whole higher education sector in\n          England. The current fee of £9,250 is now worth less than two thirds what it was when it was\n          introduced in 2012 and with the impact of recent high levels of inflation the pressure placed on\n          universities to generate an excess of income over expenditure is intense.\n          Very clearly a deficit position is not where we want to be. However, the year-end position is\n          significantly better in relation to our budget and forecasts at the start of the year. This reflects\n          focussed effort in relation to cost management. We have delivered savings through pay restraint,\n          vacancy management and controls on recruitment. We have carefully managed staff costs during\n          the year taking permanent savings where we can and recycling vacancies to better meet future\n          needs. The net impact of this is that we have managed to exceed the staff savings target of £1.5\n          million included in the revised budget by some £1.7 million.            \n                                                                                  \n          Budget managers across the University have continued to be bear down on non-staff expenditure\n          resulting in reduced expenditure of £3.2 million compared to budget. In addition, our investment\n          funds have performed well through the year primarily due to increases in equity values. This is\n          reflected in an increase in investment income of £0.5 million over 2022/23 (representing an\n          increase of 41.0%) as well as a gain on investments for 2023/24 of £1.4 million (2022/23: a\n          loss of £0.3 million).                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Given the current situation, effective cashflow monitoring and management have remained a key\n          focus for us throughout the year. Despite an increase in cash outflow from operations to £5.0\n          million from an outflow of £1.3 million in 2022/23, total cash and investments at 31 July 2024\n          totalled £46.7 million (2022/3: £49.6 million). The impact of strong financial management and\n          in-year interventions, coupled with a restriction in new capital projects being commenced, has\n          allowed us to minimise the fall in cash. We will need to retain a focus on liquidity and total cash\n          holdings for the foreseeable future.                                    \n          Organisational change and leadership                                    \n                                                                                  \n          On the 1st of August 2023, the University moved to its new operating structure, providing\n          academic focus through three larger-scale Faculties – Science, Business & Law, and Humanities\n          & Social Sciences. Each Faculty is comprised of Schools that bring together disciplines,\n          supporting continuing academic breadth whilst ensuring efficient and effective scale. I am\n          grateful to all those who worked on the organisational, operational and systems dimensions of\n          implementing this major change to tight deadlines.                      \n                                                                                  \n          Whilst there was considerable challenge going into the 2023/24 academic with a new\n          organisation and new roles and role-holders within it, the new structure has bedded in well over\n          the course of the year. Organisational reform has gone hand in hand with refreshed and renewed\n          academic leadership. For our Heads of School we have drawn on internal talent but\n          supplemented this by recruiting externally in specific areas to bring new thinking and perspective\n          into the management team. These roles, working in tandem with new student recruitment leads\n          have supported the sharper, concerted focus on recruitment that was one of my key priorities for\n          the 2024 cycle and will remain a focus into the future.                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

The feedback so far has been positive.                     \n          2024 has also seen long-standing members of my immediate senior team– the College\n          Secretary, the Pro Vice-Chancellor Research and the Pro Vice-Chancellor International - retire or\n          step down. I am grateful for their service and for their support over what has been an important\n          period of transition. In making changes to the structure and composition of the senior team for\n          the future my focus has been to capitalise on, and more closely integrate, the talent of our senior\n          academic and professional services management and to create functional groupings that align\n          leadership with underlying resource and dovetail with our urgent priorities.\n                                                                                  \n          The major institution-wide areas of strategy – education & student experience, research and\n          academic & corporate affairs are now each be led by a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, working directly\n          with the professional services areas that support those activities. In terms of continuity, Diane\n          Houston continues her work as DVC for Education & Student Experience as does Matt Innes as\n          DVC Academic & Corporate. We are currently conducting the search for our new DVC Research.\n                                                                                  \n          Financial strategy, recovery and sustainability are vital to Birkbeck. Accordingly, Keith Willett, as\n          Chief Financial Officer, is now working directly to me with a remit that includes Estates &\n          Facilities and Registry. Our digital strategy and investment in supporting infrastructure are\n          increasingly central to how we operate, compete and deliver our mission and similarly the Chief\n          Information Officer is now working directly to me.                      \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck is a small institution and in the current climate there are real challenges associated\n          with that. We cannot compensate for all the disadvantages of size but we can play to the\n          advantages of our smaller scale. Simplification of structure, management, lines of\n          communication and operation are all designed to help us realise this advantage. Birkbeck will\n          prosper by making the right strategic choices, but it needs to act and operate at a faster pace in\n          turning choice into reality.                                            \n          Progress with cost savings                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The purpose of our 2023 re-organisation was to deliver both a better operating structure but also\n          significant staff savings within it. We have achieved both objectives. In 2022/23 we delivered\n          £9.0 million in staff savings, £1.0 million more than the original target of £8 million.\n                                                                                  \n          During the year, we completed a major review of our information services, covering both our\n          library and ITS provision, with the new structure and roles within it coming into effect from 1\n          August 2024. The aim of the review has been both to deliver savings and to deliver more\n          effective, integrated provision organised around our future needs. Overall, the annual savings\n          impact for 2024/25 will be around £0.8 million.                         \n                                                                                  \n          Repositioning our course offer and the delivery of our teaching         \n                                                                                  \n          We are continuing to invest in, and make good progress in, implementing our Creating Inclusive\n          Learning initiative, having committed to an £8.0 million phased capital programme, supported in\n          part by capital funding of £3.0 million from the Office for Students (OfS).\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 13",

We have developed a new Student Learning Development Strategy to\n          provide a clear road map for our work to enhance all aspects of the student journey.\n          From the 2023/24 academic year we have created Faculty-level Head of Education posts as well\n          as school-level undergraduate and taught postgraduate leads. We have taken the opportunity to\n          enhance and clarify the roles and responsibilities for programme and module leads. We have\n          created new professional service posts aimed specifically at tracking and intervention in relation\n          to student engagement, and this work is further supported by the online student engagement\n          system being developed as part of our Student Success Project. We are continuing to review the\n          balance of our services between online and face-to-face delivery and looking at how we can\n          provide more services on site at times that will be most helpful to students.\n                                                                                  \n          We have integrated all academic development and study skills staff into one cross-institutional\n          team led by an experienced member of staff. In addition to academic support, we have worked\n          on the comprehensive student support provided via the student services team. This includes\n          orientation and induction, student advice services, financial support, student wellbeing services,\n          support for students with disabilities, mental health services, and careers & enterprise support.\n                                                                                  \n          We have invested in our capacity and expertise to support work on Student Voice and other\n          feedback and survey activity. This backs our aim to develop and improve our university-wide\n          approach to student voice and improving the student experience in response to student\n          feedback. The immediate priorities have been to: develop guidance and information to raise\n          awareness and student engagement of student feedback opportunities; establish monitoring\n          processes that track actions in response to student feedback and close the feedback loop; forge\n          stronger ties with student groups and the Birkbeck Students’ Union; to bring the student voice\n          into university projects, initiatives and monitoring; embed student feedback metrics, actions and\n          responses into Annual Quality and Enhancement processes; enhance student voice data literacy\n          and visualisations to expand the data-led culture at Birkbeck.          \n          We have put in place more support and development for our teaching colleagues. Last year, we\n          introduced a new Birkbeck fellowship pathway, focussing on early career staff. Fortnightly\n          workshops over two terms are facilitated by Birkbeck academics, external consultants and\n          experienced experts in their field. At the end of the programme participants are supported in\n          writing and submitting an application for the appropriate level of Advance HE fellowship.\n                                                                                  \n          Looking forward                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          We are continuing to focus on the following immediate priorities:       \n                                                                                  \n          Daytime teaching. Building on the initial rollout of programmes in 2024/25, we will continue to\n          expand our daytime teaching portfolio in areas of high potential demand. We are offering\n          students the choice between an afternoon and an evening offer, with study organised around\n          two- or three-days of campus attendance a week. As with evening teaching sessions, day-time\n          study will be supported with rich online learning resources.            \n                                                                                  \n          Market analysis indicates that this model should appeal to younger commuter students in\n          Greater London and its immediate hinterland combining study with other commitments and our\n          location and reputation will enable us to better compete and meet this demand.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 15",

This year we have earmarked\n          over £2.0 million of capital funding to student experience focussed projects including the\n          development of a brand-new Student Wellbeing Lounge on the ground floor of the Birkbeck\n          Central building. This front facing facility will provide flexible multipurpose spaces opening the\n          ground floor and bringing currently unusable space into use. The space will be our largest\n          student space outside of the library benefitting our current student body and responding directly\n          to the feedback received as part of our consultation with students. It recognises that our current\n          and future students need to work, collaborate and interact in new ways.

All schemes formally take account of personal\n          circumstances, and all committee members undertake both formal Equality & Diversity and\n          unconscious bias training.

Facility time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the\n          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when\n          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open\n          and transparent monitoring of this.                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 20",

The\n          principal activities undertaken by the University are teaching and research together with ancillary\n          activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include rendering academic services to\n          a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations. The University does not have any\n          subsidiaries so has no need to prepare Group accounts.                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of\n          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in\n          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard\n          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and,\n          therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The Financial\n          Statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the\n          revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).      \n          The completion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, global recovery from the\n          effects of the pandemic, geopolitical events and increases in inflation have had a significant\n          effect on families, businesses, and economies in the last few years. Despite a swift and\n          successful move to on-line learning during lockdown student numbers fell significantly in\n          2021/22 and have not recovered since. This has led to direct and indirect financial\n          consequences for the University and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.\n                                                                                  \n          Although we need to rapidly address a financial position where costs exceed income we are not\n          alone in the UK HE sector. Government regulated tuition fees for Home undergraduate students\n          remain fixed at £9,250 with the Vice Chancellor of KCL noting in September 2024 at the\n          Universities UK annual conference that a fee of between £12,000 to £13,000 more accurately\n          represents the fee required to match inflation since 2015/16. The erosion in value of the fee\n          that can be charged is placing considerable strain on the budgets of all universities in England.\n          Whilst the announcement of an inflationary increase in the home undergraduate fee from\n          2025/26 is welcomed this is more than offset by the reduction in the maximum fee we can\n          charge for non-STEM foundation year students and the impact of the National Insurance\n          increase. This Financial Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial\n          impact of pension and other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive\n          Income & Expenditure and Statement of Financial Position.               \n          Results for the Year                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Chart 3 compares the main income streams for the last five years whilst Chart 4 summarises the\n          total income for 2023/24.                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 22",

Teaching grant now represents only 2.1% of total income in comparison with\n          47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from tuition fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to\n          61.1% in 2022/23. Tuition income fell by £5.2 million this year to £63.4 million, down from a\n          peak of £79.5 million in 2020/21. 2020/21 saw a spike in applications from EU students\n          wishing to benefit from the final year of UK government tuition fee loans and this increase was\n          replaced by a significant reduction the following year as EU students had to pay their own fees –\n          an outcome seen across the sector not just at Birkbeck. Falls in new undergraduate student\n          numbers have a knock-on effect on future years as larger graduating cohorts of undergraduates\n          are replaced by lower incoming groups of students. Table 3 highlights the cohort effect of lower\n          incoming groups of undergraduates on the number of continuers from the new student peak in\n          2020/21.                                                                \n                                2019/20  2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24          \n                                   (FTE)   (FTE)    (FTE)   (FTE)   (FTE)         \n                                                                                  \n           New undergraduates     1,804    1,868   1,307   1,360   1,207          \n           Continuing undergraduates 2,862 3,088   3,215   2,857   2,515          \n                                                                                  \n          Table 3: Cohort effect of falling undergraduate recruitment             \n                                                                                  \n          Recurrent grant from Research England fell by £1.4 million (11.4%) primarily due to non-\n          recurrent grant funding received in 2022/23 to help offset the negative impact of not being\n          associated with Horizon Europe. We are pleased that UK universities are once again able to\n          collaborate with partners under the programme. Externally funded research activity fell by £1.7\n          million (18.0%) in part due to the impact on grant capture from having fewer research active staff\n          – a consequence of the need to reduce staff costs in recent years. This fall in grant income is\n          offset by a similar reduction in expenditure.                           \n                                                                                  \n          The University primarily provides teaching to its students in the evening and rents much of its\n          space to other universities during the daytime. Income from lettings, catering and conferences\n          fell by £0.1 million in 2023/24 but still represents 4.7% of total income (2022/23: 4.5%). Given\n          our size we have been very successful in generating philanthropic income receiving £2.7 million\n          in donations and endowments compared with £2.3 million the previous year.\n          Governors agreed the current investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support our core\n          business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our estates\n          strategy. £10.0 million was invested in two externally managed funds with strong Environmental,\n          Social and Governance criteria embedded in investment decision making. Both funds performed\n          remarkably well and in November 2021 combined gains of £4.0 million were realised and\n          converted into cash with both funds reset to £10.0 million. After a fall in equity values and\n          dividend income in 2022/23 investment income grew by £0.5 million (an increase of 41.0%) this\n          year with an unrealised gain in investments of £1.4 million (2022/23: unrealised loss of £0.3\n          million) being recorded.                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 24",

foundation year studied in a full-time mode\n          The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since the government increased the\n          maximum fee which universities could charge to Home undergraduates to £9,000 in 2012\n          appeared to have plateaued but further falls have now been experienced in the last three years.\n          We are pleased that the Lifelong Learning Entitlement is scheduled to be introduced from 2027\n          albeit that the start has been delayed by a year following the autumn 2024 budget. We are\n          generally supportive of measures aimed at relaxing the apprenticeship levy criteria thereby\n          enabling businesses to support a wider range of skills training through part-time and short\n          courses. It is clear that re-skilling and up-skilling of the UK workforce in key areas is a core part of\n          both national and local government strategies and we will be developing new programmes and\n          modes of delivery to further support the ambitions of part-time students.\n          Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this\n          occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown\n          restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters\n          programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to\n          upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-\n          Brexit) recovery.",

Numbers have reduced further each year with the total\n          number of Home Masters students studying in 2023/24 standing 25.8% below the number in\n          2021/22 at 1,406 FTE.                                                   \n          International recruitment has fallen significantly across the sector at postgraduate level following\n          the removal of the student dependents’ visa. Although the change came into effect in January\n          2024, enrolment in October 2023 was adversely affected. 697 new international students\n          commenced a Masters programme with us in 2022/23 compared with only 509 a year later - a\n          fall of 27.0%. International undergraduates have not been able to bring dependents to the UK\n          whilst they study so the visa change had limited impact other than to re-enforce perceptions of\n          negative sentiment towards international students. Although Birkbeck recruits significantly lower\n          numbers of undergraduates internationally in comparison with postgraduates, the year-on-year\n          fall in new starts was similar.                                         \n                                                                                  \n          Falls in new student enrolments coupled with the cohort effect of recruiting lower numbers of\n          undergraduates has inevitably had an impact on total tuition income, despite Home postgraduate\n          and international fees being increased in line with inflation each year.

We were extremely disappointed when the Government announced\n          that from 2025/26 the maximum fee allowable for non-STEM foundation year provision would be\n          £5,760 rather than £9,250. We believe that the foundation year is critical from an equality\n          perspective and remain committed to delivering the programmes. This fee reduction largely\n          erodes the positive financial impact of the recently announced inflationary increase in the\n          maximum fee we are able to charge undergraduate Home students and will prolong our ability to\n          invest in all the services we wish to provide. This financial challenge is being faced by all\n          universities and is unsustainable for a sector which is fundamental to the success of the UK and\n          its economy.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 26",

Over the same time period\n          administrative and professional costs have remained at the same level (now representing 19.1%\n          of expenditure) and premises costs have been reduced by £3.3 million (a fall from 12.9% of total\n          expenditure in 2018/19 to 10.6% in 2023/24). With falling income and increasing costs,\n          particularly due to recent historic high levels of inflation, we have had no choice but to reduce our\n          cost base. Despite this imperative, we have maintained a focus on resourcing academic and\n          academic support areas.                                                 \n          The ratio of staff costs to total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and\n          restructuring costs) is a helpful metric to review when considering financial sustainability. In\n          general, restructuring costs should be included in this metric but are excluded from Table 5\n          allowing for better year-on-year comparison. The University does not own any student residences\n          (which increase income without a corresponding material increase in staff costs) so this\n          percentage remains one of the highest in the sector.                    \n                                                                                  \n                                 18/19  19/20  20/21 21/22  22/23  23/24          \n                                  £’000  £’000 £’000 £’000  £’000  £’000          \n                                                                                  \n           Gross salaries        73,313 73,942 75,403 74,626 75,397 69,209        \n           Movement on pension   20,481 (14,884) (62) 20,270 (9,460) (29,712)     \n           provision                                                              \n           Restructuring costs    3,308   299   534  2,518  3,872  1,240          \n                                                                                  \n           Total expenditure on salaries 97,102 59,357 75,875 97,414 69,809 40,737\n                                                                                  \n           Gross salaries (excluding 69.5% 68.0% 64.0% 68.9% 68.4% 67.6%          \n           movement on pension                                                    \n           provision and restructuring                                            \n           costs) as a percentage of total                                        \n           income                                                                 \n          Table 5: Change in underlying staff costs as a percentage of income 2018/19 to 2023/24\n                                                                                  \n          Tuition fees and education contracts provided 64.3% of total income in 2023/24 (the same as\n          the previous year) whilst staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) represent\n          67.6% of total income (2022/23: 68.4%). With Home undergraduate fees fixed by the UK\n          government the annual increases in staff costs through promotions, incremental drift and pay\n          award create a mismatch between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff\n          costs. The underlying pressure is currently exacerbated by historically high inflation increasing\n          costs.                                                                  \n          Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs\n          and the University delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit referendum fall in students enrolling\n          from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 8\n          and directly led to the underlying deficit in 2018/19. We saw a significant switch back in\n          2020/21 due to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition income and a surplus was delivered.\n          Unfortunately, the fall in new student enrolments since coupled with high inflation has moved us\n          into a position of worsening underlying deficit.                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 28",

Chart 8: Staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) and tuition income 2014/15 to 2023/24\n          Chart 8 graphically illustrates the financial challenge the University faces: with a heavy reliance\n          on tuition income, and an inability to increase the Home undergraduate fee above the cap set by\n          the government, the University must increase student numbers each year to offset cost inflation.\n          Following the recent falls in student numbers and income we had no choice but to make difficult\n          choices and reduce our staff establishment. Taking a phased approach over two years, staff\n          costs have been reduced by over £11.0 million through a combination of voluntary severance,\n          early retirement and vacancy management (albeit that inflation and other increases have partly\n          eroded the underlying saving).                                          \n          Unlike a number of universities, we continue to apply the sector pay award in full when it is\n          announced. We also remain committed to paying the London Living Wage from the first day of\n          the month following the announcement of any increase.                   \n          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2020 with the effect\n          that the scheme deficit increased. Employee benefits were reduced and a repayment plan was\n          agreed in 2021/22. This deficit recovery plan increased our share of the pension liability by\n          £20.3 million with a corresponding reduction to the comprehensive income for the year. The\n          2023 valuation, however, determined that the scheme was in a far stronger position with asset\n          values exceeding the estimate for future liabilities. This change from a significant deficit to a\n          surplus was primarily down to the impact of increased inflation rates on the way the scheme is\n          valued. This improvement paved the way for significant reductions in contribution rates for both\n          employers and employees and a reversal of the benefit changes introduced the previous year.",

They are also mindful of\n          the fact that around 20% of eligible staff nationally have chosen not to be members of USS with\n          many citing that the contribution rates are unaffordable. The number of members at Birkbeck\n          rose by around 3.5% following the positive outcome of the 2023 valuation and we remain\n          supportive of plans to develop alternate, flexible pension options for staff within USS.\n          Non-staff cost budgets were reduced in the autumn of 2023 when we realised that student\n          income would not hit target and budget managers adapted and carefully monitored their spend\n          plans identifying further savings throughout the year. Tight budgetary control allowed us to save\n          around £1.7 million against the revised staff budget through careful management of vacancies.\n          This approach provided both in-year and permanent savings whilst also recycling budget to\n          priority areas. Similar non-staff savings of £1.5 million were achieved from delaying or reducing\n          planned activities.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          The provision for doubtful debts provides an assessment at the end of each year as to the\n          proportion of student related debt which may be unlikely to be recovered. The provision\n          increased by £1.0 million in 2022/23 almost certainly as a consequence of the challenge many\n          of our students are facing as inflation and interest rates have risen significantly. Some countries\n          such as Nigeria also saw material currency changes effectively increase the cost of their study\n          abroad. Interestingly, applying the same methodology at 31 July 2024 estimated the provision to\n          be £1.3 million lower at a level more akin to historic levels. This change resulted in a positive\n          budget variance of £0.7 million.                                        \n                                      Page 30",

National and global circumstances have adversely affected international\n          recruitment at all institutions again for 2024/25 and we have unfortunately been no exception.\n          Although international undergraduate numbers remained stable due to higher conversion against\n          lower numbers of applications our much larger number of postgraduates fell for the second year.\n          Chart 9 highlights the changes over the last five years (2024/25 data correct at 26 October\n          2024).                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                      International postgraduate  offers and                      \n                                                                                  \n                         enrolments  2020/21  to 2024/25                          \n                                                                                  \n                  7,050                                             14.0%         \n                  6,050                                             12.0%         \n                                                                                  \n                  5,050                                             10.0%         \n                                                                                  \n                  4,050                                             8.0%          \n                                                                                  \n                  3,050                                             6.0%          \n                                                                                  \n                  2,050                                             4.0%          \n                  1,050                                             2.0%          \n                                                                                  \n                    50                                              0.0%          \n                        2020/21  2021/22  2022/23  2023/24  2024/25               \n                Offers   3,046    3,987    5,994    6,434    3,573                \n                Enrolments 356     428     736      541      277                  \n                Conversion 11.7%  10.7%    12.3%    8.4%     7.8%                 \n                                                                                  \n          Chart 9: International postgraduate conversion 2021/22 to 2024/25       \n                                                                                  \n          We still have an opportunity to recruit for a January 2025 start but this will only add around 60\n          additional students if we hit the same figure as January 2024 (which seems unlikely given the\n          October 2024 reduction).                                                \n                                                                                  \n          A change in UK government and restrictions on international student recruitment in markets\n          such as Canada and Australia may make the UK a more attractive destination once again. We will\n          be looking to increase our undergraduate cohort and recover postgraduate numbers in 2025/26\n          as we roll out our new flexible afternoon/evening offer of study.       \n          The downturn in international recruitment has also impacted on the Home market as the more\n          selective universities looked to offset the lost international income by recruiting more UK based\n          students. Anecdotal feedback indicates that a number of universities have seen significant falls\n          in undergraduate recruitment in 2024/25 but we achieved year on year growth. Our new Vice-\n          Chancellor identified the importance of undergraduate conversion when she started in January\n          2024 and Chart 10 highlights the impact of changes in marketing, conversion and general\n          processing effectiveness.                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 32",

We do not have any\n          loans so are not pressured by financial covenants during a period of recovery. Our Balance Sheet\n          has strengthened due to the removal of the pension liability to USS and we continue to invest in\n          Estates projects to improve the student experience. Total cash plus investments fell by £2.9\n          million but remains at a relatively healthy balance of £46.7 million at the year end. The cash\n          reserves provide a buffer which will allow us a period of time to turn the deficits around.\n          Reversing the gap between tuition income and staff costs (around £6.0 million in 2023/24)\n          remains the priority and income growth rather than further major restructures will return us to a\n          break-even position. A review of downside scenarios (including a no growth scenario) indicates\n          that the University remains a going concern.                            \n          Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the University as an essential element of\n          corporate governance.

It also outlines key aspects of the risk\n          management process and identifies the main reporting procedures. The University has reviewed\n          its approach to risk management to strengthen risk ownership and to improve Birkbeck’s ability\n          to identify and assess significant risks and respond to them quickly and effectively. It has been\n          making regular reports on this to Audit Committee.                      \n          The top-level Risk Register is compiled by senior management and overseen by a Risk\n          Management Group comprising the principal risk owners. Each risk owner is responsible for a\n          risk register for their risk area in which current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. Governance and oversight for\n          each risk area is provided by the relevant University committee or management group. The risks\n          are monitored by Audit Committee and Governors.                         \n                                                                                  \n          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved\n          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The top risks are reduced student income leading to a position where costs exceed income. The\n          financial risk escalated due to lower student numbers in recent years coupled with inflation at an\n          historic high level in 2023. The underlying risk factors plus the actions taken and to be taken to\n          mitigate the risks have been discussed in this Strategic Review. Although the University is\n          forecasting underlying financial deficits for the next few years as it looks to recover student\n          numbers, we have modelled the impact of not achieving or partially achieving our plans.\n          Downside stress testing indicates that we will remain solvent however liquidity will need to be\n          managed closely. Monthly cash flow reports and management accounts are prepared and\n          reviewed by management to help identify emerging risks at the earliest opportunity.\n          Our Estates and IT teams have developed detailed risk registers for their areas of responsibility\n          which have been reviewed termly by the Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committee and Digital\n          Committee respectively. IT have worked on improving staff understanding of good password\n          management whilst also enhancing the security and monitoring of software and infrastructure.\n          Our Estates team is currently developing plans to ensure we meet our obligations under\n          “Martyn’s Law” recently approved by Parliament to increase preparedness for, and protection\n          from, terrorist attacks at public venues. Cybersecurity is likely to remain a significant risk\n          indefinitely due to the adaptability of those looking to breach security arrangements.\n                                                                                  \n          Recognising that organisational change and delivery of recovery plans are themselves a risk, in\n          mitigation we increased the range and frequency of project and management oversight groups.\n          The Vice-Chancellor now chairs fortnightly meetings of the University Executive Board (UEB) which\n          includes the DVCs, PVCs, Executive Deans and key Professional Service Directors. The Vice\n          Chancellor also holds weekly, informal, meetings of her senior leadership team. Following the\n          academic restructure that was effective from 1 August 2023, the Vice Chancellor also chairs a\n          termly meeting of a wider group of senior managers which includes all members of UEB plus\n          Heads of School, Faculty Heads of Teaching and Research and professional services Directors\n          who do not attend UEB. These meetings aim to ensure that priority recovery initiatives as well as\n          general compliance and business activity progress as expected. A range of sub-committees\n          support the work of the University including identification and mitigation of risks.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 35",

It also\n          describes our more widespread support for students with a diverse range of characteristics.\n          The University predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to\n          educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who\n          may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for\n          mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through\n          our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution\n          and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented\n          groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without\n          strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily\n          increasing to 981 FTE in 2023/24 (2022/23: 985 FTE) (see Chart 6). During 2023/24 42% of\n          our students are from ethnic minority backgrounds (2022:23: 41%), 43% male (2022/23: 42%),\n          25% declaring a disability (2022/23: 25%) and 62% over the age of 25 (2022/23: 64%). We are\n          proud to offer an opportunity to groups of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and\n          remain committed to driving this agenda in the higher education sector. \n                                                                                  \n          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students\n          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from\n          ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 97%\n          of our part-time students (2022/23: 97%) and 70% of full-time students (2022/23: 73%) are\n          over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who wish to combine evening university teaching\n          with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be\n          able to study. Over recent years we have seen a steady increase in the number of full-time\n          undergraduates aged 21 or under choosing to study at the University suggesting the ability to mix\n          education and work is increasingly attractive to younger students.      \n          The opportunity for non-traditional students with careers and other responsibilities is being\n          enhanced through both the introduction of HyFlex teaching and teaching in the afternoon. In\n          future, students will be able to study in a mode and at a time that suits their needs recognising\n          that changes in working patterns post-Covid have been significant. The flexibility to study when\n          and where is convenient for the student (rather than our staff) may also open opportunity based\n          on student location given the fact that students will no longer be required to attend all their\n          lectures on site in Bloomsbury.                                         \n                                                                                  \n          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have\n          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that\n          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes\n          for mature students, including part-time study. Our own strategic shift to more flexible delivery\n          also appears to have improved part-time recruitment in 2024/25 after many years of decline.\n          Despite the challenges faced by the part-time sector our outcomes regarding access to higher\n          education continue to be strong and demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working\n          with non-traditional students. We plan to continue with our current approach on access.\n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 37",

There are\n          inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance\n          with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial\n          statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.               \n                                                                                  \n          A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on\n          the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Basis of preparation                                                \n                                                                                    \n                These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended\n                Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial\n                Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of\n                Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit\n                requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost\n                convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).\n                The University's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and\n                position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.\n                Going Concern                                                       \n                The impact of lower student income following Brexit, increased competition across London and external\n                factors impacting international recruitment, together with historic high rates of inflation, have significantly\n                impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases\n                and increment advancement) exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due\n                to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of\n                5% of income eroded but we now need to implement a recovery plan to move from a period of actual and\n                forecast deficits back into a sustainable financial position.       \n                                                                                    \n                In order to overcome the difficult challenges we faced both prior to the pandemic and in the years since,\n                we developed a recovery strategy focussed initially on delivering staff cost savings followed by increased\n                income, primarily from regaining student numbers. The strategy aimed to improve financial sustainability\n                whilst also ensuring we could maintain research intensity, market position and teaching competitiveness.\n                Repositioning required a fundamental revision of our underlying operational and teaching delivery models.\n                To ensure that we could create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and support student success we\n                needed a greater degree of standardisation in our mode of teaching delivery.\n                                                                                    \n                With support of Governors we implemented a new academic structure at the start of the 2023/24\n                academic year supported by a reshaped range of professional support services. This restructure delivered\n                nearly £12 million of staff savings, a slimmer management structure which will allow us to take decisions\n                in a more agile manner and improved operational processes. Reducing our staff costs quickly provided\n                financial headroom to allow us to focus on delivering income recovery plans over the next few years.\n                Although we had aspirations to increase tuition income in 2024/25 external factors severely impacted\n                international student recruitment to the UK and we saw our home postgraduate numbers fall. Improved\n                conversion activity from offer to enrolment saw year on year growth in both full time and part time\n                undergraduate recruitment from both the UK and overseas. This outcome has not been achieved across\n                the sector and is a positive base on which we can build for the future.\n                                                                                    \n                We are introducing new programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate level over the coming years\n                whilst also simplifying and refreshing existing portfolio. With the support of a £3m grant from the Office for\n                Students we are upgrading all of our classrooms to provide students with the option of attending in person\n                or on-line with no reduction in the ability of the student to engage (our HyFlex mode). Building on a\n                successful pilot by our School of Law we are also developing proposals across subject areas which will\n                allow students the choice of afternoon or evening study and in many cases a mix of both. The increased\n                flexibility offered by the introduction of afternoon teaching and HyFlex should be attractive to commuter\n                students in London and the South East who are interested in study whilst working or caring.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                        Page 53",

The\n                disposal of outlying, historic buildings will both secure a capital receipt whilst also supporting our strategy\n                to provide improved learning and teaching facilities for our staff and students focussed on our main\n                campus around Torrington Square.                                    \n                Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income and effective\n                management of costs, including stress testing. Although the base-case scenario predicts underlying\n                deficits for the next few years as we build new programmes and deliver education via new, flexible modes\n                of delivery the forecasts indicate that sufficient, albeit reducing cash reserves will be maintained. Even\n                under a downside scenario where no income recovery is possible in 2025/26 we remain solvent and\n                have sufficient time to undertake further mitigating actions. Governors have reviewed the financial\n                forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and medium term recovery strategy and the\n                risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges resulting from the drop in student\n                numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the University will retain adequate resources to continue\n                in operation. As a consequence, we continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing\n                these annual financial statements.                                  \n           2.

Under\n                defined benefit plans, the University’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n                employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n                returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n                the University. The University should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net\n                of plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n                employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to\n                determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed\n                by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n                recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the university is able to recover the surplus either\n                through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n                                                                                    \n           5.

Any unused benefits are\n                accrued and measured as the additional amount the University expects to pay as a result of the unused\n                entitlement.                                                        \n           6.

The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce\n                a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.\n                                                                                    \n           7.

Any lease\n                premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.      \n                                                                                    \n           9.

Intangible assets                                                   \n                Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value\n                software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial\n                phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8\n                years.                                                              \n                Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the\n                Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for\n                capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then\n                such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes\n                available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the\n                useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.\n                                                                                    \n           13.

Investments in\n                subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the University's accounts. Current asset investments\n                are held at fair value with movements recognised within total comprehensive income for the year.\n           14.  Cash and cash equivalents                                           \n                Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months\n                from placement and overdrafts.                                      \n                                                                                    \n           15.

It is, therefore,\n                a charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the\n                University is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within\n                categories covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the\n                Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively\n                charitable purposes.                                                \n                The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is\n                included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their\n                cost.                                                               \n           17.

Restricted endowment reserves include balances\n                which, through endowment to the University, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the\n                university must hold in perpetuity.                                 \n                                                                                    \n                Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,\n                therefore, the University is restricted in the use of these funds.  \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 58",

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n                                                                                    \n                Management considers that certain accounting estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, debtors,\n                fixed assets and provisions are its critical accounting estimates.  \n                In preparing these financial statements the University has made the following judgements:\n              a) Pension provisions include key assumptions on discount rates, salary inflation and staff numbers in the\n                future. Where the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to one of the\n                pension schemes, this is recognised as a liability on the balance sheet. Provisions are based on\n                management's estimate of expected future salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing\n                rate of discount. Further details are set out in note 25.           \n              b) The holiday pay provision is calculated using a sample of departments within the University.\n              c) A general provision for bad and doubtful debts is calculated using a formula based on the age of the\n                overdue debt. The formula is applied consistently each year but necessarily requires a degree of\n                estimation. A specific provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for individual debts where recovery is\n                believed to be uncertain and this requires an element of judgement. \n                                                                                    \n           19.  Termination payments                                                \n                Termination benefits are recognised as a liability and expense when the University has a constructive\n                obligation, such as a formal plan in place that is effectively communicated to affected employees. The\n                liability is measured at the value of payments expected to be made to employees under the termination\n                arrangements. See also accounting policy 15.

This was over and above the target investment for\n              2023/24 of £1,850,000.                                                \n                                                                                    \n              Work in 2023/24 has included progressing the projects outlined in the revised Access and Participation Plan\n              2022-25 as approved by the Office for Students in Autumn 2023. This includes ongoing work in student\n              engagement monitoring, and the Faculty Professional Services staff reorganisation delivered in autumn\n              2023 saw new Student Engagement Officers commence their work in each of the faculties. We appointed a\n              new Student Success Research and Evaluation Lead during the academic year to increase our capacity to\n              evaluate our work. The portfolio review completed during the Autumn Term 2022 was delivered, with new\n              structure programmes commencing from Autumn 2023.                     \n              The University’s internal Professional Services reorganisation included the Access and Engagement Team,\n              and these staff associated with taking forward the Access and Participation Plan are now part of the\n              Education Directorate and are leading on the next iteration of the University’s APP due for submission to the\n              OfS in October 2024. The Access and Engagement Team continued to deliver programmes through 2023/24\n              to support young people in further education and mature learner engagement during the period. Its spend is\n              below target due to the mid-year departure of the Director and another member of the team taking one term\n              of unpaid leave.                                                      \n              As noted in the 2022/23 financial statements, the University purposefully reduced its overall expenditure on\n              individual student bursaries, as agreed with the OfS. Expenditure in this in this area was above the target\n              investment for the year and the £67,000 overspend in this category was primarily in Student Hardship\n              Funds.                                                                \n              Investment to support disabled students increased significantly this year, with additional expenditure in\n              mental health services and study support. Research and Evaluation spend increased slightly with the\n              introduction in the summer term of the dedicated staff role mentioned above.\n              The 2020/21 - 2024-25 Access and Participation Plan can be found here:\n              https://accessandparticipationplans.officeforstudents.org.uk/accessplansdownloads/2024/BirkbeckColleg\n              e_APP_2020-21_V2_10007760.pdf                                         \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 66",

The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,\n              providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the\n              scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the\n              assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution\n              is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify\n              its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As\n              required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as\n              if it were a wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the Income and\n              Expenditure represents the contributions payable to the scheme.       \n              Where a scheme valuation determines that the scheme is in deficit on a technical provisions basis (as was\n              the case following the 2020 valuation), the trustee of the scheme must agree a Recovery Plan that\n              determines how each employer within the scheme will fund an overall deficit. The institution recognises a\n              liability for the contributions payable that arise from such an agreement (to the extent that they relate to a\n              deficit) with related expenses being recognised through the income statement.\n              FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of\n              a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme\n              is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such\n              as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer\n              has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results\n              in the recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that\n              they relate to the deficit) with the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.\n              University Governors are satisfied that the Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a\n              multi-employer scheme.                                                \n              The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2023 (the\n              valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 77",

The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective\n              to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of\n              the assets of the scheme was £73.1 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £65.7\n              billion indicating a surplus of £7.4 billion and a funding ratio of 111%.\n              The key financial assumptions used in the 2023 valuation are described below.

As\n              set out in note 17, no deficit recovery plan was required under the 2023 valuation because the scheme was\n              in surplus on a technical provisions basis. The University was no longer required to make deficit recovery\n              contributions from 1 January 2024 and accordingly released the outstanding provision to the Income and\n              Expenditure.                                                          \n              At 31 July 2023, the institution’s balance sheet included a liability of £29,044 million for future contributions\n              payable under the deficit recovery agreement which was concluded on 30 September 2021, following the\n              2020 valuation when the scheme was in deficit. No deficit recovery plan was required from the 2023\n              valuation, because the scheme was in surplus. Changes to contribution rates were implemented from 1\n              January 2024 and from that date the institution was no longer required to make deficit recovery\n              contributions.

The Trustee adopts\n              assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits\n              already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued\n              pension rights to be met.                                             \n              The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events turning\n              out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove the risk\n              that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.\n              A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and\n              independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2023.\n              Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new\n              accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.       \n              The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2023 and will be reviewed again at\n              SAUL's next formal valuation in 2026.                                 \n              At 31 March 2023 valuation SAUL was 105% funded on its Technical Provisions basis (31 March 2020:\n              94%). As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at that date, no deficit contributions were\n              required. The Trustee and the Employers have agreed that the ongoing Employers' contributions will reduce\n              from a rate of 21% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE salaries from 1 September 2024.\n              Employer contribution rates for SAUL Start are set at 16%, employee contribution rates are the same as for\n              the defined benefit scheme.                                           \n                                                                                    \n              Accounting Policy                                                     \n              Birkbeck is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and does not\n              identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of SAUL's\n              assets at 31 March 2023 was £3,096 million representing 105% of the liabilities.\n                                                                                    \n              It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.\n              Birkbeck accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and pension costs\n              are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs 28.11 of FRS\n              102.                                                                  \n              As there was a Technical Provision surplus at 31 March 2023, no deficit contributions were required\n              following the 2023 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit\n              contributions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the University.        \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 80",
