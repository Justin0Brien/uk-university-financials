The performance of the Vice Chancellor is monitored throughout the year including through 1:1 performance appraisal with the Chair of

Other staff costs (1,503) (1,508) (785) (788) what fair and competitive base pay looks like for the role at Aston University. The primary comparison is carried out using several different

Additionally, the Remuneration Committee also commissioned an independent external review of senior remuneration which reported in
September 2018. This included an analysis of the Vice-Chancellor’s reward using different metrics to help form a more-rounded picture of
the appropriate level of pay when set against the University’s performance against a variety of measures. This review also used an analysis

Head of Provider to median employee pay multiple:
Year ended 31 July 2021 Year ended 31 July 2020
Basic Salary 7.6 7.9
Total Salary 7.5 8.0
The median employee salary figure used to calculate the above ratio is based on the annual full time salary of all included on the University’s
payrolls. This includes all individuals that the University includes in its HESA staff record, including any individual service companies who are
deemed employees under IR35.
This excludes agency staff, individuals with honorary contracts where the contract is not deemed to be a contract of employment and
self-employed individuals outside the scope of IR35. Agency staff are excluded as it is not possible with the current systems and processes
in place to identify the equivalent annual salary at an individual level. Agency staff are used for a range of activities across the University,
however, they are often not full-time, are charged for via third parties often on a consolidated basis and the rate charged includes a fee to the
third party and VAT. Therefore, it is not possible to identify an accurate median salary for these individuals.

The University has alerted the OfS that the Financial Support element of the plan is understated and should be £1,242,336 rather than the

Actual spend was £3,204,484 (£1,068,643 over target). Within this there was a small underspend against planned Access investment due
vacancies and the impact of Covid-19 (online activities being significantly cheaper than ‘in person’ activities). Underspend was redirected to Charge for the year – 6,864 2,181 2,645 – 11,690

Significant Judgements and Estimates
General 674 439 Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial
Balances at 31 July 1,717 1,408 statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:
Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS)
The University obtains a valuation from Hymans Robertson LLP who make decisions on behalf of the University on the financial assumptions
used to calculate the net liability of the scheme. These assumptions include the RPI%, CPI%, salary increases, pension increases, mortality
rates, discount rate and the estimate of the duration of employer liabilities.
The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill and judgement in setting these parameters as the pension experts rather
than suggesting a rate.
Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach and the full actuarial
valuation will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.
Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a collection of entities under
common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and
represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme
where the employer has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the
recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the
resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that USS meets the definition of a
multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in
existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit required in the financial statements has used assumptions on staff salary
inflation percentages and the percentage change in staff numbers in subsequent years. In making the estimated percentages, management
considered past movement in salary inflation and staff numbers as well as considering the University’s strategic plans, current economic
climate and consistency with AUPS assumptions.
Aston University has also chosen to apply the discount rate provided by Mercer Limited actuaries in the USS modeller. Mercer Limited have
used a set of assumptions to arrive at the discount rate with Aston University accepting the set of assumptions as reasonable.
