          Operating environment                                                   
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck is a unique institution providing access to degree education for working Londoners
          through the provision of teaching in the evening. As a consequence, most of our students are
          mature and have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The fact that we are
          different from the majority of higher education providers in the UK (who mostly teach young
          undergraduates during the day) often means that Government policy and other external factors
          have a different, and often unexpected, influence on Birkbeck. As an example, the advent of the
          Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) policy and the 2012 undergraduate funding changes,
          resulted in significant shifts in our student profile. As a specialist part-time study institution, we
          were forced to quickly develop and introduce full-time evening programmes in 2010 as a risk
          mitigating strategy against the policy changes which did not affect predominantly full-time
          universities. Our part-time undergraduate population contracted by over 60% with full-time
          evening degrees compensating for this decline. The College now has around 3,000 full time
          equivalent (FTE) full-time undergraduates (from around zero in 2009) and 1,400 FTE part-time
          undergraduates (falling from 3,800 in 2011/12).                         
          Three external factors have impacted on the College over the last few years and are expected to
          influence our strategy over the next few years: Brexit; the Post-18 Review of Education and
          Funding chaired by Philip Augar (the Augar review); and the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme
          (USS).                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since
          2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off
          equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of
          £5.0 million in 2018/19. The main cause of this was a significant fall in EU students in 2017/18,
          the first full recruitment cycle after the EU referendum on 23 June 2016. In 2017/18, we
          recruited nearly 400 fewer EU students than in 2016/17. Although many UK universities
          experienced a reduction in applicant numbers that year, the effect on Birkbeck was more
          marked. A high proportion of our students from the EU already live and work in London and it was
          from this group that we saw the highest fall in enrolments in 2017/18. We believe that this was a
          direct result of Brexit related uncertainty over employment and residency.
                                                                                  
          The trend continued into 2018/19 with enrolments of EU nationals falling a further 200 – a
          cumulative drop of 30.3% between 2015/16 (pre-Brexit) and 2018/19. In financial terms this
          equated to a reduction in income of £4.0 million. New enrolments for 2019/20 indicate an
          increase of 100 student FTEs (18% year-on-year). This is likely to be a “dead cat bounce” effect
          as students from the EU start their programmes before the UK Government removes their right to
          loan funding for the length of their study once the UK leaves the EU. It is likely that 2020/21 will
          be the final year that EU students will receive financial support for their studies and we fully
          expect numbers to fall drastically from 2021 onwards. Although a fall in numbers is likely, it is
          possible that charging EU students higher fees may compensate financially although this is a
          risky assumption. We continue to encourage students worldwide to study at Birkbeck and are
          carefully considering our options for when we finally depart from the EU.
          The Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) has come under pressure financially over the
          last few years as mortality rates increased and market returns fell. The Pensions Act 2004
          requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective which aims to have sufficient and
          appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the most recent valuation date of 31
          March 2017, the technical provisions exceeded the assets of the scheme by £7.5 billion – a
          funding ratio of 89%. This led to the pension trustee proposing a new deficit recovery plan which
          increased the College share of the pension liability from £11.1 million to £31.8 million.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          More importantly, an initial proposal from USS recommended that the defined benefit aspect of
          the scheme be removed and that contribution rates would need to increase. This led to a period
          of strike action from academic staff in 2017. At the time, Birkbeck was vocal in its support for the
          creation of a Joint Expert Panel (JEP) made up of representatives from employers and members
          to review the valuation assumptions and propose alternate solutions which retained a defined
          pension benefit. As a result, the first report from the JEP led to the USS trustee retaining a
          defined benefit whilst also increasing employer and employee contributions to reduce the deficit.
          The JEP is scheduled to provide a second report in the autumn of 2019 which looks at the long
          term position of the scheme. It was tasked with developing strategies which led to a financially
          sustainable, affordable and inter-generationally fair scheme. The USS trustee agreed to
          undertake an extra valuation as at 31 March 2018 in an effort to reduce further contribution
          increases which had been proposed by the 2017 valuation and to allow for a two-year period to
          consider the second report from the JEP. College Governors are concerned about the increasing
          costs of the scheme and the impact it has on both the College and employees in terms of
          affordability. They are supportive of the aims of the JEP and in particular wish to see a scheme
          developed which does not require future members to make increased contributions or suffer
          reduced benefits in order to fund decisions taken today. Inter-generational fairness along with
          affordability will be the key focus of any College response to consultations on the future of the
          scheme.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          Although USS has required a fair amount of management focus over the last couple of years and
          remains a risk for the future, we are pleased to note that the Superannuation Arrangements of
          the University of London (SAUL) was fully funded at the most recent valuation. SAUL provides
          pension benefits for non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and institutions, including Birkbeck.
                                                                                  
          The impact on the financial position of the College following lower student income as a result of
          Brexit and higher staff costs, in part from the increasing contributions to USS, can be
          demonstrated in Chart 1.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases and increment
          advancement) exceeds the inflationary increase in in our main source of income (primarily due to
          the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees). As a consequence, not only
          have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but without significant remedial
          action these deficits will grow as the gap between staff costs and tuition income widens. We are
          also mindful that student recruitment in an increasingly competitive environment post-Brexit is
          challenging and that developing plans based on student number growth alone will be risky.
          Our institutional strategy commits us to a series of investments designed to improve the quality
          of our core teaching and research activities and to modernise our material and organisational
          infrastructure. Cumulatively the goal is to ensure that we keep true to our unique mission and
          look and perform at a level in keeping with our reputation for excellence.
                                                                                  
          Crucial strands of this strategy are:                                   
                                                                                  
            •   Student experience review implementation, ensuring that our diverse student body is
                properly supported to succeed resulting in strong National Student Survey (NSS) and
                Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF) outcomes;
            •   Estates strategy for expansion and modernisation of the estate, addressing
                longstanding issues about teaching space and delivering appropriate research facilities;
            •   Improved research support infrastructure to cement our place in the top tranche of
                research intensive institutions at the REF.                       
                                                                                  
          None of our three key institutional goals are self-funding. All require upfront investment and the
          primary gains are in terms of depth and quality and in moving the experience of students and
          staff on to a par with the comparator institutions against which we benchmark ourselves. Whilst
          in the long term there will be financial gains - directly through improved retention and research
          funding and indirectly as a result of reputational impact – these will not be at a level that in and
          of itself sustains a higher equilibrium.                                
                                                                                  
          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with
          turnover of £100 to £250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we
          are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost
          pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and
          student body adds major complexity and inflexibility to our underlying business model. Provision
          at the heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue
          other activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity into 15 hours
          a week in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be
          addressed.                                                              
          More fundamentally, in addition to tuition fee and income, our benchmark competitors currently
          have significant additional income streams, primarily through campus/facility related income and
          through knowledge transfer/spin off/commercialisation activities. As we have neither residences
          nor a science park/innovation hub, we lack these income streams.        
                                                                                  
          These comparisons do indicate that in order to function effectively we need to generate
          additional income streams of our own. Whilst growth based on our existing portfolio is an
          important part of any recovery plan we also need to spread risk by investing in growth across a
          range of initiatives.                                                   
                                                                                  
          To do so, we have looked to our unique mission and unrivalled location and attempted to turn
          them to our advantage rather than see them solely as drivers of increased cost and complexity.
          As an institution embedded in the social fabric of a metropolis we are seeking to generate

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          additional activity and income streams aligned with the needs of London’s culture, economy and
          society.                                                                
                                                                                  
          In tandem with developing additional income streams and increasing student numbers we must
          also closely manage our staff cost base. We are committed to maintaining promotion and
          recruitment processes which develop and reward talent. We are also making interventions in
          relation to our equalities and diversity strategy and looking to integrate and support teaching and
          scholarship staff who are currently on sessional contracts (some on an open-ended basis as part
          of an ongoing role, others in response to specific and non-recurrent needs). In this context the
          adoption of an expectations and workload framework for academic staff, alongside
          appraisal/review, is a significant development which enables us to ensure that we are using our
          resources effectively.                                                  
          The issues of complexity, and the incremental layering of new activities onto pre-existing
          structures as the College has sought to rapidly adapt, identified in relation to teaching is also true
          for the College’s professional and support services and School-based administrations. Whilst
          elements of this have been and are being tackled with focused reviews of specific processes, the
          current situation requires a more holistic externally supported review that focuses additionally on
          organisation, capacity, capability and resource that will inform service planning and delivery in
          this new climate. Cumulatively both the development trajectory we are proposing, and these
          initiatives, do constitute a significant level of organisational change.
                                                                                  
          In order to deliver the strategic objectives whilst returning to a sustainable financial position we
          have agreed to focus on the following core building blocks:             
                                                                                  
            •   Rebase staff costs so that the College can return a break-even budget (before
                exceptional items) with 9,000 students (FTE):                     
                                                                                  
                We successfully launched a voluntary severance and early retirement scheme in the
                autumn of 2018 and achieved recurrent savings of around £3.0 million in staff costs. A
                review of the efficiency and effectiveness of administration will commence in 2020
                backed by benchmark data from the Uniforum methodology (a process used by many
                Russell Group universities in recent years) and it is assumed that further staff savings
                will be identified from this process. Further academic savings are also likely as we
                modernise our portfolio and delivery.                             
            •   Reduce non-staff budgets by £2.0 million from a 2017/18 base and maintain levels at
                the same cash position year-on-year:                              
                                                                                  
                Governors approved a non-staff budget for 2019/20 which (before exceptional items)
                was £2.0 million lower than in 2017/18.                           
                                                                                  
            •   Deliver recovery plan projects:                                   
                                                                                  
                A range of new activities and projects were identified in 2019 which aim to maximise
                returns from existing resources whilst developing income diversification initiatives which
                build on the unique nature of our position in the higher education sector in London.
                Each project has a senior member of staff tasked with delivery and all support the
                mission and values of the College.                                
                                                                                  
          Our prudent financial forecasts aim to move us from an underlying deficit before exceptional
          items of £5.0 million in 2018/19 to a break-even budget in 2020/21, with increasing surpluses
          thereafter.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Although financial recovery will be challenging we are different to most multi-faculty, daytime-
          teaching, predominantly undergraduate universities. Having demonstrated our teaching quality
          by achieving a silver award in the Teaching Excellence Framework and our research quality from
          a highly successful Research Excellence Framework assessment, this coupled with our unique
          mode of delivery gives us strong encouragement that we will successfully achieve our ambitious
          plans.                                                                  
          We were pleased to see a recognition in the Augar report that falling part-time student numbers
          needed to be reversed. We have lobbied long and hard since 2012 and believe that a lifelong
          funding scheme that supports mature learners to upskill, change career or indeed to enter higher
          education for the first time is essential. Although the implementation of the recommendations in
          the Augar review is uncertain given current political turmoil we have noted the positive
          statements in the recent letter from the Minister to the Office for Students (OfS) which included
          part-time and flexible study as one of the governments priorities for the OfS for 2019/20. We
          look forward to helping to develop strategies.                          
                                                                                  
          Although there are positive recommendations for us in the Augar report there are also some
          uncertainties. A reduction in undergraduate fees where funding directly from students is not
          replaced by grant funding and the introduction of differential fees depending on subject area
          would set our recovery plan back. Whilst these two concerns are likely to affect most of the
          sector, one that could affect the College disproportionately could be the methodology used to
          monitor value for money (which is also a core objective for the OfS). Our students work during the
          day, often full time, and as a consequence are time poor in comparison with their daytime-study
          peers elsewhere. Birkbeck offers working Londoners a unique way to study whilst working and
          the imposition of contact time metrics without recognition of this uniqueness could be
          detrimental. We will continue to focus on the development of government policy to ensure that
          our current and future students are given the opportunities and support that they need.
                                                                                  
          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
          Birkbeck set out his vision:                                            
               ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’
                                                                                  
          This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,
          work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer
          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,
          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. Within an increasingly volatile
          operating environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and
          contribution to science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all
          of our activities.

          Awards                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards and honours
          received during the year.                                               
          Professor Joanna Bourke from Birkbeck’s Department of History, Classics and Archaeology has
          been appointed as Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College, London’s oldest higher education
          institution. The Professorship of Rhetoric at Gresham dates back to the College’s founding in
          1597, in accordance with the will of Sir Thomas Gresham, builder of the Royal Exchange. In this
          role, Professor Bourke will continue a 422-year-old tradition of giving free educational lectures to
          the general public within the City of London and beyond. Past Gresham Professors of Rhetoric
          include the poets Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis, the historian Sir Richard Evans and the
          writer and literary scholar Sir Jonathan Bate.                          
                                                                                  
          Professor Bourke is a well-known social and cultural historian, a Fellow of the British Academy
          and outgoing Chair of its Modern History Section and a prizewinning author of thirteen books.
          She is a prolific public speaker and is College Orator at Birkbeck, as well as a frequent and
          award-winning contributor to TV and radio programmes.                   
                                                                                  
          Dr Antoine Bousquet, Reader in International Relations, was awarded the Science, Technology
          and Art in International Relations (STAIR) Book Award for his recent book, The Eye of War: Military
          Perception from the Telescope to the Drone. The Eye of War offers a timely and ground-breaking
          genealogy of military perception that elucidates the socio-technical foundations of the
          contemporary condition of “fatal visibility,” in which anything that can be perceived can be
          targeted with lethal force. In addition to providing a history of global and increasingly granular
          practices of targeting, the book explores their wider implications for the landscape of
          international security in the twenty-first century and further reflects on the place of the human
          subjects within the late modern war machine.                            
                                                                                  
          In making the award, the judging committee highlighted “the creativity of conceptual and
          empirical work, the ways in which the book fractures established ways of reading targeting,
          including critical engagements” and its exemplary “transversal work across disciplinary
          boundaries.” The STAIR Book Award is conferred annually for the best book that develops
          interdisciplinary advances to how science, technology and arts permeate international politics.
          The award recognises a book that advances innovative research agendas on the intersections
          between international relations and the politics of science, technology and art.
          Dr Sarah Lloyd-Fox was awarded the Wiley Prize in Psychology from the British Academy in
          recognition of her outstanding contribution to the study of infants. Dr Lloyd-Fox recently led a
          project exploring the levels of brain activity in babies in response to social stimuli such as peek-a-
          boo and the sound of laughter, finding what could be the earliest marker of autism to date.
                                                                                  
          In July 2019, the British Academy also announced that three Birkbeck academics; Professors
          Susan James, Esther Leslie and Julia Lovell would be awarded fellowships for their achievements
          in the humanities and social sciences. The three professors will join a group of 1,400 academics
          who make up the UK’s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          facilities. Governors approved an Estate Strategy which determined that a number of projects
          were required to improve the quality of our research and teaching space and also to increase the
          amount of teaching space that was under the direct, or shared, control of the College.
                                                                                  
          A governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards
          (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design teams,
          senior College staff and independent Governors) which feed in to the Strategic Estates
          Committee (a sub-committee of Governors). The structure aims to ensure that all aspects of each
          project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is obtained, the
          building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on major projects
          are also provided to each meeting of the Finance & General Purposes and Audit committees to
          provide assurance that all risks are being appropriately managed.       
          For the past twenty years, the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development’s (CBCD) BabyLab has
          been investigating the psychological processes in infants’ brains and they have uncovered major
          insights into child development. The BabyLab scientists have identified the earliest marker of
          autism in babies, examined the links between Down’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease and
          investigated the effects of screen time on babies as young as six-months-old. The first project to
          commence construction is a purpose built ToddlerLab to extend the research of CBCD to older
          children.                                                               
                                                                                  
          The ToddlerLab will be equipped with sophisticated wireless technology which allows toddlers to
          carry out normal activities while tracking their brain activity and monitoring their behaviour. An
          example of the cutting-edge technology is a virtual environment known as the “CAVE” which
          simulates real-world surroundings, such as a farm or a supermarket, and monitors how toddlers’
          brain activity changes depending on the world around them. Construction of the ToddlerLab is
          progressing and is scheduled to open in 2020.                           
                                                                                  
          In April 2018 the College received planning permission from the London Borough of Camden to
          renovate and extend a 1920’s building, called Cambridge House, on Euston Road. London-based
          architect, Penoyre & Prasad, added a copper-clad two-storey lecture theatre to the top of the
          existing structure to create a flexible and high quality teaching space. The plans also include a
          café and active learning space on the ground floor and basement and teaching classrooms on
          the upper floors. The building will add around 440 square metres of additional teaching space to
          the College building portfolio providing capacity for over 600 students and staff. Construction
          commenced in 2019 with the building due to open for the start of the 2020/21 academic year.
          In addition to the new building projects the original Estates Strategy identified two additional
          projects with an estimated cost of around £100 million – construction of a new multi-storey
          annex adjacent to our Bloomsbury headquarters and demolition/re-construction of an old
          extension block in the same vicinity. Further opportunities to improve the quality of our teaching
          space have since arisen and significant structural works to some of our Georgian buildings have
          been identified. We also need to continue to invest in long term maintenance, infrastructure and
          capital equipment. With many competing priorities and a financial plan that is based on
          consolidation and recovery, the College is carefully considering its position. The key objectives
          outlined in the Estates Strategy remain valid, and Governors are keen to invest in the estate
          where it benefits teaching and research, but the timing and scale of estates projects are currently
          being re-evaluated against affordability criteria. The Strategic Estates Committee will review
          existing and potential projects during the year.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Gender pay gap                                                          
                                                                                  
          Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, the
          College was required to report gender pay data to the government for the first time in March
          2018. The metrics used were based on data to 31 March 2017 and updated 12 months later. As
          well as reporting on the gender pay gap. Birkbeck undertakes a full pay audit periodically to
          provide analysis and recommendations in relation to reward and related management strategies,
          policies and practices across the institution (most recent 2018). We support the principle of
          equal pay for work of equal value and are committed to operating a pay system that is
          transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which rewards staff in line with the
          College’s commitment to equality and diversity. These reviews analyse pay gaps by ethnicity,
          disability and sexual orientation as well as gender.                    
          The gender pay data published in March 2019 for hourly pay and bonus pay is summarised in
          Tables 1 and 2:

            Gender pay gap 8.5% lower Gender pay gap 10.2% lower Total employees 1,913
          Table 1: Gender pay gap – hourly pay                                    
                                                                                  
          The 2018 figures show an increase in both the mean and median gender pay gap compared to
          2017, up 0.9% and 5.0% respectively.                                    
                                                                                  
          The changes are due in part to the upgrading of the College HR and payroll databases which
          have allowed better contractual management of seasonal and casual workers. This has reduced
          the total number of employees who were active at the census point. The population change
          accounts for a small proportion of the mean gender pay gap but is more significant to the median
          gender pay gap increase. Another factor was the difference in the average increase of the hourly
          rates. In the year preceding the census date 40% of female staff did not receive the incremental
          pay increase because they were at the top of the pay scale, a proportion that is double that of
          male colleagues. The result was that the mean hourly rate increased by 5.0% for men and 3.9%
          for women.                                                              
          Whilst the 2018 figures are not as positive as the previous year, Birkbeck remains committed to
          further progress on equal pay and has set out both an action plan and monitoring targets.

          Birkbeck makes a relatively low number of bonus payments in comparison to the wider sector -
          the sector average is 8.4% of staff receiving a bonus payment, at Birkbeck it is 2.6%. A
          consequence of this is that outlier payments distort gender bonus pay gap. This can be seen in
          the 32% difference between the mean and the median bonus gender pay gap. Removing two
          outlier payments, one female and one male, brings the mean bonus pay gap to 1.2% which is
          more representative of the recognition practices at the College.

          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal
          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the
          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted
          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena
          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the
          academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application
          and promotion rate of women to more senior academic roles. Work continues on this issue.
          The College Equal Pay Audit 2018 examines gender but also includes analyses of pay gaps by
          ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. The full report, which includes actions and benchmark
          data, can be found at http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/equality/equal-pay-audit
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2018
          to 31 March 2019                                                        
                                                                                  
          The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
          April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
          range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility Time is the
          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown on the
          next page.

                philanthropy to the areas of greatest need, be it students, infrastructure or research.

          Last year, 285 volunteers donated over 3,800 hours of their time to help enhance the student
          experience and support learners across the College. By giving their time our volunteers directly
          helped nearly 550 students. These volunteers continue to play an important role in aiding
          student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives.

          The Financial Statements presented to the Governors comprise the consolidated results of the
          College and its subsidiary. The principal activities undertaken by the Group are teaching and
          research together with ancillary activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include
          rendering academic services to a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations.
                                                                                  
          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of
          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2015 and in
          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard
          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,
          has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are
          prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed
          assets and derivative financial instruments).

          The recurrent teaching grant from the government has been falling steadily since undergraduate
          tuition fees were increased in 2012 and fell by a further £0.6 million in 2018/19 (a reduction of
          9.5% year-on-year). Teaching grant now represents only 5.1% of College income in comparison
          with 47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in
          2005/06 to 63.9% in 2018/19 (up by £1.1 million on 2017/18).            
          Income from research grants and contracts is £4.1 million lower than the previous year largely
          due to the recognition as income of a non-government funded equipment grant of £3.3 million in
          2017/18. Although the electron microscope that was purchased was capitalised with
          depreciation being charged over a ten-year period, FRS102 required that the non-government
          grant was released in full.                                             
          A consortium of Bloomsbury Colleges which included Birkbeck, agreed to sell their shared
          interest in a property to one of the members of the consortium. The property had originally been
          purchased in part using capital funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England
          (HEFCE) as a base in which to undertake joint international development projects. The activity
          became less strategically important over time resulting in agreement to dispose. The property
          was independently valued and resulted in a profit on sale for the College of £0.6 million once the
          deferred capital grant and accumulated depreciation had been accounted for. Sale proceeds of
          £0.7 million were received.                                             
          Other income has remained broadly static over the last few years.

          Chart 6: Main levels of study enrolment trends 2011/12 to 2018/19       
          The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since 2011/12 continues but appears
          to be slowing. After much lobbying by the College since the undergraduate fee was increased in
          2012, we are pleased to see “innovative and flexible provision” outlined as one of the Secretary
          of State for Education’s strategic priorities for the Office for Students (letter from Rt Hon Gavin
          Williamson CBE MP to Sir Michael Barber, Chair of the OfS. dated 16 September 2019). In
          particular, the minister states that he “would like to see the OfS continue to focus on part-time
          and flexible learning through a set of ambitious plans to deliver real choice and flexibility
          throughout working lives, and in response to the needs of business.” This of course chimes with
          our own mission. Further emphasis is placed on the importance of providing lifelong learning
          opportunities for mature students and for developing funding arrangements which increase
          student choice. An interim report is expected in March 2020 and we hope that policy decisions
          quickly follow which reverse the declines in mature and part-time numbers following previous
          Government decisions.                                                   
          Our strategy to introduce full-time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be
          seen in Chart 6. We continue to recruit well in a competitive undergraduate market in London
          despite enrolments being affected by a reduction in EU nationals. Chart 7 starkly demonstrates
          the significant impact the Brexit referendum in June 2016 had on recruitment of EU nationals
          with numbers falling by 18.4% in 2017/18 (the first full recruitment cycle after the referendum)
          and a further 12.2% in 2018/19.

          In 2016/17, postgraduate recruitment showed a marked increase (Chart 6) due to the
          introduction of the postgraduate loan. Full-time numbers then fell slightly in 2017/18, partly due
          to the fall in EU students but also to increased competition as more institutions advertised the
          new student loan which had originally been announced close to the start of the 2016/17
          academic year. Recruitment picked up again in 2018/19 with postgraduate masters students
          representing 28.5% of total enrolments (2017/18: 27.4%).                
          Income from full-time Home and EU students decreased by £0.1 million as greater numbers of
          home students offset the continuing fall of students from the EU. Income from international
          students rose by £0.7 million (an increase of 9.2%) and now represents 7.9% of total income
          (2017/18: 7.0% of total income). International student income has steadily grown over the last
          five years and we believe that there is scope for further increases, particularly with the re-
          introduction of the post-study work visa. Income from part-time students rose by £0.6 million –
          the first year-on-year increase since the dramatic fall in numbers from 2012.

          The analysis of expenditure confirms that the College continues to invest heavily in education
          and research with only 20.8% of total expenditure (2017/18: 21.1%) spent on administration
          and other professional services.                                        
                                                                                  
          Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and
          restructuring costs) has risen from 59.6% in 2015/16 to 69.5% in 2018/19 (see Table 3). The
          College does not own any student residences (which increase income without a corresponding
          increase in staff costs) so this percentage is one of the highest in the sector.

          Tuition fees and education contracts provided 65.1% of total income in 2018/19 (2017/18:
          62.3%). Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff
          costs. A post-Brexit fall in students enrolling from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs
          switched this around as indicated in Chart 10. A Voluntary Severance and Early Retirement
          Scheme was launched in 2018 which will deliver around £3.0 million of annual savings from

          2019/20. This will go some way towards reducing the current deficit but further staff savings will
          be required. A staff costs as a percentage of total income ratio above 60% will not be sustainable
          and reducing costs still further along with increasing income through diversification are the two
          key objectives of our recovery plan.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Following a number of years of income growth and the generation of surpluses, the impact on
          enrolments of the EU referendum in 2016 and increasing pressure on our budget due to staff
          costs, led to an adjusted deficit before other gains and losses of £0.9 million in 2017/18. This
          increased to an underlying deficit of £5.0 million in 2018/19 as the College developed plans for
          recovery.                                                               
          In June 2019, Governors agreed a recovery plan which aims for an underlying budget deficit of
          £3.0 million in 2019/20 followed by break-even the year after. Recognising the increased
          competition for students as the UK leaves the EU, our forecasts have now been set on modest
          student number growth to 9,000 FTE in two years (2018/19: 8,738). Although our forecasts
          have prudently capped student numbers against our existing portfolio we believe that there are
          opportunities. A number of strands are currently being developed including: portfolio
          development; improved retention; increased application to enrolment conversion rates;
          introduction of access programmes to facilitate progression to postgraduate programmes;
          increased focus on international recruitment; development of additional on-line delivery etc. In
          addition, income diversification initiatives will be developed and we will ensure that all costs are
          efficiently and effectively managed. The College has a unique mode of delivery so we are
          confident that our plans will succeed and we will then return to generating annual surpluses.
                                                                                  
          The years of generating surpluses placed the College in a relatively strong position as it
          embarked on financial recovery. The level of cash accrued provided Governors with assurance
          that revenue recovery initiatives could be phased and that a couple of years of planned deficits
          could be supported. The cash reserves also allowed us to continue with the first two building
          projects in our estates strategy: a new teaching building and an annex to a research facility. Both
          projects are scheduled for completion in 2020 and in addition to capital equipment purchases,
          represented a cash investment of nearly £6.0 million in the year. The timing and scope of further
          building projects will need to be reconsidered in line with progress against our recovery plan.
                                                                                  
          The triennial valuation of the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) as at 31 March 2017
          led to increased contribution rates for both employees and employers and the adoption of a new
          deficit recovery plan. This resulted in an increase in the obligation for the College to fund its
          estimated share of the pension liability from £11.1 million to £31.8 million. The change in liability
          increased the charge to staff costs recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income &
          Expenditure by £21.0 million. As summarised in the analysis in Table 4, the College was already
          posting an underlying deficit before other gains and losses with the deficit increasing
          substantially following the inclusion of the change in pension liability. Pension liability increases
          of three times the 2018 position have been experienced by all members of USS.
          Having completed the 2017 valuation, the USS Trustee agreed to undertake an additional
          valuation as at 31 March 2018 and to consider the proposals presented by the Joint Expert
          Panel (JEP) in their report published in September 2018. The JEP was set up in early 2018 with
          representatives from Universities UK (on behalf of scheme employers) and the University &
          Colleges Union (on behalf of scheme members) to review the assumptions used in the 2017 USS
          valuation.                                                              
                                                                                  
          The 2018 valuation of USS, which incorporated some of the JEP recommendations, was
          completed after the Balance Sheet date of 31 July 2019. This valuation proposed slightly lower
          contribution increases than those included in the 2017 valuation and outlined a two-year period
          in which employer and employee representatives could review the second report of the JEP which
          considers the long term sustainability of the pension fund (due to be published Autumn 2019).
          The valuation also outlined an amended deficit recovery plan which reduces the College share of
          the liability from £31.8 million to an estimated £18.2 million. This is to be accounted for as a
          non-adjusting post-Balance Sheet event in the 2018/19 financial statements with the positive
          adjustment being reflected next year.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          College Governors are concerned about the increasing costs of the scheme and the impact it has
          on both the College and employees in terms of affordability. They are supportive of the aims of
          the JEP and in particular wish to see a scheme developed which does not require future
          members to make increased contributions or suffer reduced benefits in order to fund decisions
          taken today. Inter-generational fairness along with affordability will be the key focus of any
          College response to consultations on the future of the scheme.          
          Posting underlying deficits and undertaking capital building projects is eroding our cash but this
          is currently manageable given the reserves we have accrued. The USS pension liability is an
          ongoing risk from an affordability perspective and has skewed the revenue outturn and total net
          assets posted for the year. Although we have a lot of work to do to overcome our financial
          challenges, and being mindful of the unprecedented uncertainty in the higher education sector
          and wider UK economy, we believe that the unique mode of delivery of the College will provide us
          with many opportunities.                                                
                                                                                  
          Risk Management                                                         
                                                                                  
          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  
                                                                                  
          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to
          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit
          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key
          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main
          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        
                                                                                  
          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and
          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and
          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,
          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The
          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual
          report on internal control and risk for 2018/19 was presented to the Audit Committee in May
          2019.                                                                   
          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  
                                                                                  
          The top risks for the College for 2019/20 outlined in the annual report are:
                                                                                  
            •  Student recruitment                                                
                                                                                  
               Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance
               on tuition fees as our main source of income. During the year the same trend as the
               previous year was apparent and although enrolments were 6% higher year on year we did
               not meet the recruitment targets needed to offset an underlying deficit. There is fierce

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
               competition for students among higher education institutions with private and alternative
               providers joining universities on the Office for Students’ register. A continuing decline in
               the number of 18-year olds has prompted institutions that have not previously been
               competitors to edge into the more mature student market to maintain their numbers. Our
               recruitment of EU students fell following the referendum and although EU students can
               still obtain financial support to study in the UK they are choosing not to.
               The level of risk is likely to stay high in 2019/20. We have controls in place which aim to
               maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the application, offer and enrolment
               processes. The Vice Master chairs a recruitment monitoring group and is also leading an
               admissions and enrolment review. During the year we also introduced centralised
               admissions decision making for UCAS programmes to improve offer turnaround times.
                                                                                  
               Other measures aimed at recovering student numbers include developing new provision
               to attract new students. The Degree with Foundation Year has proved to be successful
               and we are putting more resource into international recruitment with a view to increasing
               numbers for 2020/21 and beyond. We are also working with partners to expand the
               range of on-line programmes we offer. With a high reliance on tuition income, this risk
               has been given a net risk score of 14.0 (red).                     
                                                                                  
            •  Financial sustainability                                           
                                                                                  
               Following a number of years in which the College returned significant surpluses as a
               percentage of income, post referendum we have seen staff costs exceeding tuition
               income for the first time as student numbers fell below our recruitment targets. A deficit
               budget was set for 2018/19 and recovery plans have been developed which aim to
               return us back to an underlying break-even position by 2020/21 (before exceptional
               adjustments such as changes to the pension liability).             
                                                                                  
               In April 2019 the Office for Students published a report titled Financial Sustainability of
               Higher Education Providers in England which noted: “In a financially challenging
               environment for higher education providers, and with the UK 18-year old population
               continuing to decline in the short term, the OfS has particular concerns about the
               credibility of providers’ student number forecasts. Our analysis suggests that over the
               next few years the sector in aggregate is assuming a level of growth in student numbers,
               and related fee income, which is not likely to be achievable.” Analysis of our own
               enrolment trends concluded that forecasting growth for the College in the current
               environment was risky and we based our financial forecasts on static student numbers.
               Having rebased our student recruitment target to the current level with an aspiration for
               growth, rather than planning for growth, we have focused on efforts to rebuild through
               careful cost reduction and delivering a range of recovery programme projects. The
               projects are ambitious and will not produce increased student numbers or income
               immediately but their successful delivery is critical to planned financial recovery. To
               mitigate the risk of projects being delayed or not delivering the forecast returns, project
               leads have been appointed and progress is being monitored by a group chaired by the
               Vice Master. Regular reports are provided to the Strategic Planning Committee and
               Governors.                                                         
                                                                                  
               In light of our strategy not to plan for increased student numbers our need to reduce
               costs has strengthened. We introduced a Voluntary Severance and Early Retirement
               Scheme in 2018/19 which succeeded in reducing staff costs by around £3.0 million. The
               College has joined the Uniforum benchmarking programme undertaken by Russell Group

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
               institutions with the aim of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of administration.
               Costs savings are expected to be delivered from this review from 2020. Further reviews
               of the cost effectiveness of activities across the College are planned for 2019/20
               overseen by the Vice Master and College Secretary.                 
                                                                                  
               The College has a unique position in the sector being the only evening provider of higher
               education. The recovery plan seeks to build on our unique selling point by maximising
               recruitment to existing programmes, diversifying income streams through the
               development of new modes of study or programmes and by reducing costs. Governors
               remain committed to the aspirations underpinning our Estates Strategy and improving the
               student experience so it is critical that we focus our attention on projects which return us
               to a position of financial sustainability.                         
               School Executive Deans and key strategic staff regularly meet to consider areas for
               investment and to oversee the delivery of projects identified in the recovery plan.
               Strategic Planning Committee is the executive body responsible for returning the College
               to a sustainable financial position and reports on progress and risks are provided to
               Governors through the committee structure. Financial sustainability is inextricably linked
               to student recruitment and, therefore, has been given the same net risk score of 14.0
               (red).                                                             
                                                                                  
            •  Estates Strategy                                                   
                                                                                  
               A number of risks have been noted in relation to the Estates Strategy including: projects
               do not effectively meet the stated objectives; project budgets are not appropriately
               managed; and the impact of estates projects on our financial sustainability. The
               governance structure for overseeing major estates and infrastructure projects has
               changed slightly for 2019/20 with the Strategic Estates Committee (a majority Governor
               and Governor chaired committee) replacing the Estates Committee (a majority executive
               and executive chaired committee). With a range of aspirational and critical projects to
               consider in a financially tricky period, we believe that the new committee will provide the
               robust challenge and oversight required.                           
               Project Boards (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the
               external design teams, senior College staff and independent Governors) remain in place
               for the building projects under way and they will feed in to the Strategic Estates
               Committee. The Finance & General Purposes and Audit committees continue to oversee
               the financial and risk management aspects of building and infrastructure projects and
               the management of major projects is routinely reviewed by our internal auditor.
                                                                                  
               It is our aim that all Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck
               facilities or in buildings shared with other HE institutions. As a consequence, we are
               looking for further opportunities to increase the amount of space meeting this objective.
               Some of our Georgian buildings require major remedial works and we need to ensure that
               our space is appropriate for the continuing delivery of high quality research. The risks
               associated with the delivery (or non-delivery given the financial position of the College) of
               the Estates Strategy have been assigned an overall net score of 12.25 (amber).

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Brexit, the fluid political environment and the long term impact of the Universities
          Superannuation Scheme on the College have not been included in our risk register as specific
          risks due to the uncertain outcomes and our inability to control them. Reports on the possible
          impact on the College and associated risks are routinely prepared and discussed at Strategic
          Planning Committee and with Governors.                                  
          Audit Committee was provided with an update in September of the main developments since
          they approved the College risk register in May. The net scores for each of the main risks
          remained unchanged.                                                     
                                                                                  
          Public Benefit Statement                                                
                                                                                  
          The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:                         
                                                                                  
          “The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
          who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
          instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
          any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
          may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
                                                                                  
          As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
          required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Act describes 13
          broad areas of charitable activity. The Governing Body has regard to the Charity Commission’s
          guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in the following manner.
                                                                                  
          The advancement of education                                            
                                                                                  
          The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
          the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   
          The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins
          everything we do.                                                       
                                                                                  
          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
          the Charities Act (see below for examples). The following table summarises our research income
          over the last three years:

          Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. The College currently has a
          portfolio of live research projects linked to over £50 million in external grant funding.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The prevention or relief of poverty                                     
                                                                                  
          The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
          disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
          resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
          health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
          It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
          concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
          (prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
          contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.
          Birkbeck is an evening university, predominantly delivering teaching in the evening, retaining our
          historic mission to educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its
          doors to people who may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to
          enabling access for mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of
          younger students, through our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a
          widening access institution and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming
          from under-represented groups. We remain committed to driving this agenda in the higher
          education sector.                                                       
                                                                                  
          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are BAME
          or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 93% of our part-time
          students and 67% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who
          wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities
          for students who otherwise would not be able to study.                  
                                                                                  
          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that
          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes
          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time
          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and
          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to
          continue with our current approach on access.                           
          The following sections are taken from the College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to
          2024/25 as examples which demonstrate our performance against various measures in recent
          years.                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Higher education participation, household income, or socioeconomic status
                                                                                  
          We believe that providing part-time and flexible education can facilitate social and economic
          mobility and we have a long and proud history of enabling learners who may not have previously
          had the opportunity, to access degree-level study.                      
                                                                                  
          The standard measure of participation, POLAR3/4, does not work well in London, with very few
          postcodes falling into the lowest quintiles despite London having significant areas of deprivation.
          We, therefore, use the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) as a more robust measure of
          the socio-economic backgrounds of our students. 61% of all undergraduate entrants come from
          the lowest two quintiles of IMD deprivation with our own survey data showing a significant
          proportion living in households with low annual income - 39% of full-time undergraduate students
          living in households with an annual income of less than £25,000 per annum and 46% of part-
          time students coming from a household with annual income below £40,000 per annum. These

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          rates have been consistent over a number of years in both full-time and part-time student
          populations.                                                            
                                                                                  
          Attainment of a “good degree” can be a challenge for disadvantaged students. The gap between
          those from the lowest quintiles and those from the highest at Birkbeck has considerably
          improved amongst full-time students, from a gap of 17% in 2014/15 to 7% in 2017/18. This gap
          is smaller than the sector and London averages. The gap in our part-time degree student
          population is just above the sector average at 16% and is something we are developing
          strategies to address.                                                  
          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by
          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In
          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.
          We also offer all self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free
          monthly instalments over the academic year.                             
                                                                                  
          Disability                                                              
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck admits a much larger proportion of students with disabilities than the sector as a whole:
          over 23% of our full-time entrants in 2016/17 disclosed a disability compared with 13% in the
          sector (HESA 2017/18 data). 16% of our students have a mental health condition, with two
          thirds of this group also having multiple disabilities. Our disabled students tell us that our
          evening provision is helpful to them as their conditions often prevent them from travelling during
          rush hour or attending morning lectures. It is not uncommon for a psychiatric care plan to
          encourage a patient to embark on studies at Birkbeck as part of their recovery. We welcome this
          client body and are committed to providing support to ensure a level playing field for such
          students, to attain further qualifications and change their lives.      
                                                                                  
          When looking at the continuation rates of students with disabilities compared to those without, at
          Birkbeck they continue at the same rate as, or in the case of part-time, better than students with
          no disabilities. In fact part-time students with disabilities at Birkbeck continue at a 9% higher rate
          than their non-disabled peers (in the sector disabled students’ continuation is 6% poorer than
          non-disabled). This positive gap has been seen consistently over the last few years and is
          testament to the high levels of support they receive. Attainment of a good degree by disabled
          students is also higher when compared to their non-disabled peers:      
          Ethnicity                                                               
                                                                                  
          Our widening access provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than
          focusing on ethnicity but as our work is exclusively in London our approach means that we work
          with high numbers of students from BAME groups. Consequently, our student body is ethnically
          diverse. While the BAME proportion of London’s population is 40%, 56% of our full-time and 42%
          of our part-time undergraduate entrants identify as BAME                
                                                                                  
          Continuation and attainment gaps between different ethnic groups at the College are being
          closely monitored and progress has been made over the last few years. As an example, whilst
          continuation rates for black students are better than the sector average there is still a gap when
          compared to all other students at the College, particularly for those studying part time (see Chart
          11).

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019

          Chart 11: Continuation rates                                            
                                                                                  
          The gap in attainment of a good degree in our black, compared to white, full-time student
          population has improved from a high of 50% in 2014/15 to 31% now. Despite this considerable
          improvement, the current gap, and the equivalent part-time gap of 39%, is concerning. We have
          undertaken data analysis in order to understand this issue better, looking at factors including the
          age and subject of study of black students. Through linear regression analysis we find these
          attributes do not have any significant impact on the attainment of black students at Birkbeck. We
          calculate that just under a third of the gaps in attainment are attributable to entry qualifications
          and other student characteristics and that there is an “unexplainable” gap of 18% for full-time
          and 24% for part-time students. Reducing these gaps in attainment is our main priority in the
          Access and Participation Plan cycle.

          A unique interactive digital platform that allows users to visually peel back the layers of London’s
          history was launched during the year. The Layers of London project uses maps, films and
          personal memoirs to document how London has changed from Roman times to the present day.
                                                                                  
          Project Director Professor Matthew Davies (Executive Dean of Birkbeck's School of Social
          Sciences, History and Philosophy) worked with colleagues at the Centre for Metropolitan History
          at the Institute of Historical Research, the British Library, the Museum of London Archaeology
          (MOLA), Historic England, London Metropolitan Archives and The National Archives. Layers of
          London also includes contributions from the public, who show how Londoners have responded to
          events through history and adapted to their changing city.              
                                                                                  
          The project is designed to be a treasure trove of fascinating and quirky information about life
          through the ages. Among details chronicled are how it was possible to barter a Christmas cake
          for a chicken in East London in 1954, how painting a white cross by your door would guarantee
          you would be woken up for work and how 17th century maps would have included ‘the Road to
          Oxford’ rather than what we now know as Oxford Street in central London.
                                                                                  
          The project is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Stavros Niarchos foundation, the Ford
          Britain Trust and the Institute of Historical Research Trust.

          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The advancement of health or saving of lives                            
                                                                                  
          A study by researchers at Birkbeck has found evidence that regularly practising a tricky online
          memory game can improve mental well-being in teenagers. Compared to a control group,
          adolescents who trained their working memory using the game reported a significant reduction in
          depression and anxiety scores at the end of their training with symptom reduction even more
          pronounced one month later.                                             
          The findings, published in Developmental Science, found that adaptive training led to an 11%
          reduction in self-reported depression at the end of training and a 25% reduction at one-month
          follow-up. Depression scores in the control group were unchanged after training and had
          increased by 11% after one month. Anxiety ratings in the adaptive training group dropped by 13%
          at one-month follow-up, compared to a non-significant decrease (3.75%) in the control group. The
          adolescents participating in the study were not a clinically depressed or anxious group.
                                                                                  
          Similar positive effects of cognitive training have been seen in adults but this was the first study
          to show these training effects in typical adolescents. Patricia Beloe, a PhD student at Birkbeck
          who conducted the study noted that the findings are evidence of causal links between working
          memory and emotional vulnerability in teenagers and demonstrate that it may be possible to
          address vulnerability to anxiety and depression with easy-to-implement interventions that target
          cognitive factors.                                                      
                                                                                  
          The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of
          religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity                   
                                                                                  
          The first national study of prejudice in over a decade revealed widespread experiences of
          prejudice affecting different groups in Britain. The study, led by Professors Diane Houston
          (Birkbeck) and Dominic Abhrams (Kent) along with Dr Hannah Swift (Kent), sampled nearly 3,000
          adults. An additional survey of minority groups to ensure sufficient numbers to provide
          confidence in findings was also completed. Published by the Equality and Human Rights
          Commission (EHRC), the research found that in the last year: 70% of Muslims surveyed
          experienced religion-based prejudice; 64% of people from a black ethnic background
          experienced race-based prejudice; 61% of people with a mental health condition experienced
          impairment-based prejudice; and 46% of lesbian, gay or bisexual people experienced sexual
          orientation-based prejudice.                                            
          David Isaac, Chair of the EHRC, said: “It’s very clear that some people are still conflicted about
          equality and that prejudices still risk fostering discrimination in Britain. It’s disturbing that some
          people feel comfortable expressing negative views about others – especially members of the
          Gypsy, Roma and Traveller, Muslim and transgender communities. Openly voicing negative
          attitudes can hinder constructive debate about the barriers people face and creates divisions
          and mistrust in society. Understanding people’s attitudes and the extent of prejudice in all its
          forms is key to unlocking the barriers that may hold many people back. This report sets out a
          workable model that we believe the government should build on to understand the current state
          of prejudice and discrimination in Britain. One person's gain does not mean that others lose out.
          If everyone gets a fair chance in life, we all thrive.”                 
                                                                                  
          By bringing together a set of measures of people’s experiences of prejudice and of people’s
          attitudes, the survey provides the most comprehensive picture available of prejudice and
          discrimination in Britain, and helps us to understand the impact of prejudice on people’s lives.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE GOVERNORS' RESPONSIBILITIES                    
                                                                                  
          In accordance with the Charter and Statutes of the College, the Governors are responsible for
          exercising the powers of the College. Governors have oversight of the College's affairs and are
          responsible for ensuring effective administration, management and internal control. The
          Governing Body is required to present audited financial statements for each financial year.
                                                                                  
          The Governors act as the trustees of the College and are responsible for ensuring that proper
          accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
          position of the College; and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements are prepared
          in accordance with the College’s Charter and Statutes and the Statement of Recommended
          Practice on Accounting for Further and Higher Education and FRS102: The financial reporting
          standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. In addition, within the Terms and
          Conditions of Funding for Higher Education Institutions set out by the Office for Students
          (successor to the Higher Education Funding Council), the Governors, through the Master as the
          accountable officer, are required to submit an annual accountability return including financial
          statements which comply with the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction and give a true and fair
          view of the College's state of affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses,
          changes in reserves and cash flows for the year.                        
          In causing the financial statements to be prepared, the Governors have ensured that:

          • they are satisfied that the College has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
            foreseeable future (for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019

          The key elements of the College’s system of internal financial control, which is designed to
          discharge the responsibilities set out above, include the following:    
                                                                                  
          •    clear definitions of the responsibilities of, and the authority delegated to, Executive
               Deans, Directors of Operation (Schools), Assistant Deans and Directors of Professional
               Services;                                                          
                                                                                  
          •    a comprehensive medium and short-term planning process, supplemented by detailed
               annual income, expenditure, capital and cash flow budgets and forecasts;
          •    regular reviews of key performance indicators and business, operational, compliance and
                                                                                  
               sustainability risks and reports of variance from the annual income and expenditure
               budget;                                                            
          •    clearly defined and formalised requirements for approval and control of expenditure, with
               investment decisions involving capital or revenue expenditure being subject to formal
               detailed appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the Governors;
                                                                                  
          •    comprehensive Financial Regulations, detailing financial controls and procedures,
               approved by the Audit Committee and Finance and General Purposes Committee; and
                                                                                  
          •    a professional Internal Audit Service whose annual programme is approved by the Audit
               Committee. The Audit Committee receives reports on internal audit activity within the
               College. The Chair of Audit Committee provides the Governors with reports on internal
               audit activity and an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the College's system
               of internal control, including internal financial control.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT                                          
                                                                                  
          Corporate governance and accountability arrangements                    
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck College is a body incorporated by Royal Charter. Although the College does not have
          shareholders, and is not a listed company, the Governing Body is committed to achieving high
          standards of corporate governance in line with accepted best practice. This summary describes
          the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in the UK Corporate
          Governance Code insofar as they relate to universities. Its purpose is to help the reader of the
          accounts understand how the principles have been applied.               
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body                                                      
          The Governing Body (“Governors”) comprises independent members, students, alumni and
          employees appointed under the Statutes of the College, the majority of whom are non-executive.
          There is a majority of independent members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the
          Governing Body are separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.
                                                                                  
          The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and
          Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities. The Governing
          Body is responsible for the ongoing strategic direction of the College, approval of major
          developments and the receipt of regular reports from Senior Management on the day to day
          operations of its business.                                             
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is responsible for the College's system of internal control and for reviewing
          its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
          against material misstatement or loss.                                  
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including
          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and
          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of
          reference. All independent members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the
          Governors on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.           
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE
          (now the Office for Students) and the Committee for University Chairs (CUC) for regular
          effectiveness reviews. The review concluded that the Governing Body, individually and
          collectively, is effective. The review put in place measures to improve new Governor selection and
          induction and to give Governors more opportunities for engagement with the College outside
          formal Governors’ meetings. The diversity of the Governing Body has increased following the
          appointment of new independent governors through an open call for expressions of interest.
          The Governing Body agreed to carry out a proportionate review of its effectiveness, based on the
          CUC HE Code of Governance, in 2019/20 once the new Chair of Governors has started his term
          of office.                                                              
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of
          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. In 2018
          the Governing Body agreed changes to the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference and
          reporting protocol, to increase transparency and accountability in line with new guidance from
          the CUC. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's
          processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code. The Governing Body has
          approved, and annually reviews, a set of Key Performance Indicators linked to College strategic
          objectives.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
          managing the College's significant risks, linked to the achievement of strategic objectives, that
          the process has been in place for the year ended 31 July 2019 and up to the date of approval of
          the annual accounts, that it is regularly reviewed by the Governing Body and that it accords with
          the internal control guidance for directors in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the
          principles in the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.
          Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee                   
                                                                                  
          On all academic matters the Governors must consider, but not necessarily follow, the advice of
          the Academic Board, which is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the
          College. The Academic Board has a membership of around 150 drawn almost entirely from
          academic staff and the students of the College and chaired by the Master. It delegates some of
          its powers to its Executive Committee.                                  
                                                                                  
          Finance and General Purposes Committee                                  
                                                                                  
          The Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&GPC) reviews and then recommends to the
          Governors the College’s annual revenue and capital budgets and monitors performance in
          relation to the approved budgets. It reviews and then recommends to Governors the financial
          regulations and financial policies that are applied to management. It reviews the annual financial
          statements and considers financial strategy. In addition, the Investment Committee is
          responsible for the College investments on behalf of F&GPC.             
                                                                                  
          The Finance and General Purposes Committee met three times during the year.
                                                                                  
          Nominations Committee                                                   
                                                                                  
          The Nominations Committee considers nominations for independent member vacancies in the
          Governing Body membership under the relevant Statute and for Governing Body appointed
          vacancies on College Committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into account the
          balance of skills, knowledge and experience of members and are based on assessment against
          objective criteria. It also considers issues of succession planning and diversity within the
          Governing Body.                                                         
          The Nominations Committee met once during the year and also held a Special Meeting to
          consider the appointment of a new Chair of Governors (to be in post from 1 October 2019).
                                                                                  
          Remuneration Committee                                                  
                                                                                  
          In 2018/19 the Remuneration Committee determined the annual remuneration of the Master
          and of professorial and senior administrative staff. Independent members of Governing Body
          receive no remuneration for their services although expenses incurred in attending meetings are
          met by the College. Members of the Governing Body who are employees of the College receive no
          additional remuneration for their services to the Governing Body. The cost of living salary
          increases for all staff are determined by national pay negotiations for all universities. The
          employee members have no involvement in determining their own salaries. 
                                                                                  
          The Remuneration Committee met two (2017/18: three) times during the year to consider the
          annual remuneration of professorial and senior professional services postholders; and the
          remuneration of the Master. It was noted that the Master had not made an application for any
          increase in remuneration for the academic year 2018/19.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Further to the Committee for University Chairs’ new guidance on remuneration committees
          (published in 2018), and in response to its recommendations, the College Remuneration
          Committee revised its terms of reference. The revisions include confirmation that the
          Committee’s membership is wholly independent and does not include any College staff, a focus
          on remuneration of the core senior team, a stronger link between remuneration and individual
          and institutional performance, and more extensive and transparent reporting of the Committee’s
          decisions.                                                              
          These were approved by the Governing Body and the revised terms of reference are in operation
          from 2018/19.                                                           
                                                                                  
          Remuneration Committee also considered the requirements in the OfS Accounts Direction for
          these financial statements to include a justification for the total remuneration package for the
          Master and a pay multiple ratio expressing the relationship between the Master’s remuneration
          and that for all other employees. It has agreed these elements, which are in note 7 of the
          financial statements, noting that they have been produced retrospectively and relate to decisions
          made during the reporting period.                                       
                                                                                  
          Audit Committee                                                         
                                                                                  
          The Audit Committee comprises wholly independent members drawn from the Governing Body
          and includes a co-opted member so has no executive responsibility. Members have recent,
          relevant financial and other appropriate experience. The Audit Committee met four times during
          the year.                                                               
                                                                                  
          The Audit Committee relies substantially on the work of the internal and external auditors, on the
          information provided by management and the response of management to the questions it
          raises.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The remit of the Audit Committee includes:                              
            •  reviewing the effectiveness of the College’s systems of internal control and risk
               management;                                                        
            •  satisfying itself and assuring the Governors that satisfactory arrangements are in place to
               promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness thereby securing value for money;
            •  reviewing and approving the remit of the internal audit function;  
            •  advising the Governors, as necessary, on the appointment and remuneration of the
               internal and external auditors, and their quality, reliability and effectiveness;
            •  reviewing with the external auditors the scope and nature of the audit, including the
               report to Audit Committee written by the external auditors; and    
            •  assessing compliance with the HE regulatory framework.             
                                                                                  
          The external and internal auditors have a standing arrangement to meet with the Audit
          Committee regularly without senior officers present. The auditors also attend meetings with
          senior officers to consider the items listed above and to review plans for the audit process.
          The College’s internal audit function provides, by undertaking review, independent objective
          assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk
          management framework and the design and effectiveness of the operation of internal controls
          that are intended to control critical business application risks. Internal audit also helps the
          College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating
          and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by
          working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by
          internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews
          are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate
                                      Page 40

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                    
                                                                                  
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
          Audit Committee (continued)                                             
                                                                                  
          action confirmed to the Audit Committee. The head of the internal audit has unfettered access to
          the Audit Committee.                                                    
                                                                                  
          The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
          dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
          monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
          that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the
          Audit Committee.                                                        
          The senior management team and the Audit Committee receive regular reports, including value
          for money reports, from internal audit which include recommendations for improvement. The
          Audit Committee's role in this area is to carry out a high level review of the arrangements for
          internal financial control. The Audit Committee and the Strategic Planning Committee review risk
          and control during the annual compilation of the risk register and report to the Governing Body.
          The Audit Committee also reports on the effectiveness of the College’s management of risks to
          the Governing Body each term. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance
          and not merely reporting by exception. At its summer 2019 meeting, the Governing Body
          approved the risk management report for 2018/19 and the risk register for 2019/20, taking into
          account reports from College management and the Audit Committee. In November 2019 the
          Governing Body considered and approved the annual report of the Audit Committee on its work
          during 2018/19, including a report from the internal auditor.           
                                                                                  
          Strategic Planning Committee                                            
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Planning Committee consists of College officers with strategic management
          responsibility. Its remit is to consider College-wide strategic issues and priorities and to advise
          Governors accordingly. It is responsible for internal planning and resource allocation policy and
          procedures. It oversees the annual planning and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools
          and Professional Services on developing plans and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for

          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,         
          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON                                                    
                                                                                  
          REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                         
                                                                                  
          Opinion                                                                 
          We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the College”) and
          its subsidiary (“the Group”) for the year ended 31 July 2019 which comprise the Consolidated
          and College Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure, Consolidated and College
          Statement of Changes in Reserves, the Consolidated and College Balance Sheets and notes to
          the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
          reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
          Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial
          Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally
          Accepted Accounting Practice).                                          
          In our opinion, the financial statements:                               
            •  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the College’s affairs as at 31
               July 2019 and of the Group’s and the College’s income and expenditure, gains and
               losses, changes in reserves and of the group’s and the College’s cash flows for the year
               then ended;                                                        
            •  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
               Accounting Practice; and                                           
            •  have been properly prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
               Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education and relevant legislation.
                                                                                  
          Basis for opinion                                                       
          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
          (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are
          independent of the Group and College in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
          relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
          and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
          believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
          for our opinion.                                                        
                                                                                  
          Conclusions relating to going concern                                   
          We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK)
          require us to report to you where:                                      
            •  the board of governors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of
               the financial statements is not appropriate; or                    
            •  the board of governors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified
               material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the College’s
               ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least
               twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
          Other information                                                       
          The board of governors are responsible for the other information. Other information comprises
          the information included in the Strategic Report and Corporate Governance Statement, other
          than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
          statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
          conclusion thereon.                                                     
                                                                                  
          In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
          information including the Strategic Review and Corporate Governance Statement and, in doing
          so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
                                      Page 42

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019

          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON                                                    
                                                                                  
          REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)             
                                                                                  
          statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
          misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
          misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the
          financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
          we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information
          we are required to report that fact.                                    
          We have nothing to report in this regard.                               
                                                                                  
          Opinion on other matters required by the Office for Students (“OfS”) and Research England
                                                                                  
          In our opinion, in all material respects:                               
            •  Funds from whatever source administered by the higher education institution for specific
               purposes have been properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with
               relevant legislation.                                              
            •  Funds provided by the OfS and Research England have been applied in accordance with
               the Terms and Conditions of Funding and any other terms and conditions attached to
               them.                                                              
            •  The requirements of the OfS’s accounts direction have been met.    
                                                                                  
          Responsibilities of the governors’                                      
          As explained more fully in the governors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 32, the
          governors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied
          that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the governors determine is
          necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
          misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.                            
                                                                                  
          In preparing the financial statements, the governors are responsible for assessing the Group and
          the College’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
          going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the governors either
          intend to liquidate the Group or the College or to cease operations, or have no realistic
          alternative but to do so.                                               
                                                                                  
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements    
          Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
          whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
          auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
          is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
          material misstatement when it exists.                                   
          Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
          aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
          on the basis of these financial statements.                             
                                                                                  
          A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on
          the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
          description forms part of our auditor’s report.                         
                                                                                  
          In addition, we also report to you whether income from funding bodies, grants and income for
          specific purposes and from other restricted funds administered by the College have been
          properly applied only for the purposes for which they were received and whether income has

       for the year ended 31 July 2019                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       1.    Basis of preparation                                                 
             These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
             Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2015 and in accordance with Financial
             Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
             Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
             requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
             convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
                                                                                  
       2.    Basis of consolidation                                               
             The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to 31
             July 2019. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
                                                                                  
             The financial year-end of the College's subsidiary, Cambridge House Ltd, is 31 October. Transactions to 31
             July 2019 are included in the consolidation.                         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union
             as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
                                                                                  
       3.    Income recognition                                                   
             Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
             Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms of
             the contract have been satisfied.                                    
                                                                                  
             Fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the Consolidated
             Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.
             Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is
             shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not deducted
             from income.                                                         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure
             on a receivable basis.                                               
                                                                                  
             Grant funding                                                        
             Government revenue grants, including funding council teaching and research grants, are recognised as
             income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended
             to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income within
             creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more than one year as
             appropriate.                                                         
                                                                                  
             Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
             College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received in
             advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors
             and released to income as the conditions are met.

             Donations and endowments                                             
             Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
             endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
             when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is
             utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
                                                                                  
             Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
             during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to
             the terms applied to the individual endowment fund.                  
                                                                                  
             There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
                                                                                  
          a) Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular
             objective;                                                           
          b) Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
             invested to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College; and
          c) Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
             invested to generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
                                                                                  
             Capital grants                                                       
             Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the
             funds were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the
             College has satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       4.    Accounting for retirement benefits                                   
             College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation
             Scheme (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The
             schemes are primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued
             every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries. 
                                                                                  
             Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and
             liabilities of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a
             defined contribution retirement benefit schemes.                     
                                                                                  
             A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
             schemes.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2019                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       4.    Accounting for retirement benefits (continued)                       
                                                                                  
             Defined contribution plan                                            
             A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed
             contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
             amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
             expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
                                                                                  
             Defined benefit plan                                                 
             Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to
             determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed
             by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
             recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
             through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       5.    Employment benefits                                                  
             Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
             expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are
             accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused
             entitlement.                                                         
                                                                                  
       6.    Finance leases                                                       
             Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
             asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
             corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
             and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
                                                                                  
             Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
             outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
             a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.

       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2019                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       7.    Service concession arrangements                                      
             Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
             present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
             financial liability.                                                 
                                                                                  
             Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
             charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
             arrangement.                                                         
                                                                                  
       8.    Operating leases                                                     
             Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
             premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.       
                                                                                  
       9.    Foreign currency                                                     
             Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
             transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
             are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
             differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income and
             Expenditure for the year.                                            
                                                                                  
       10.   Fixed assets                                                         
             Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
             losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
             transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
             at the date of that revaluation.                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
             assets.                                                              
                                                                                  
             Land and buildings                                                   
             Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
             initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
             benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
             life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.         
                                                                                  
             The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
             depreciated as follows:                                              
             Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                           
             Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                        
             Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years                                  
                                                                                  
             Leasehold land: the life of the lease                                
             Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2019                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       10.   Fixed assets (continued)                                             
                                                                                  
             Equipment                                                            
             Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
             equipment is capitalised.                                            
                                                                                  
             Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
             lives are as follows:                                                
             - Computer hardware: 3 years                                         
                                                                                  
             - Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
             - Other equipment: 3 to 5 years                                      
                                                                                  
             Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
             Balance Sheet.                                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       11.   Heritage assets                                                      
             Works of art and other valuable artefacts have been capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
             acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not depreciated
             as their long economic life means that any depreciation would not be material.
                                                                                  
       12.   Intangible assets                                                    
             Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
             software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial
             phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current intangible asset is 8 years.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       13.   Investments                                                          
             Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
             Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
             investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
             year.                                                                
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       14.   Stock                                                                
             Stock is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value and is measured using an average cost formula.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2019                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2019                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       15.   Cash and cash equivalents                                            
             Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months and
             overdrafts.                                                          
                                                                                  
       16.   Provisions                                                           
             Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:          
          a) The College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
          b) It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
          c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     
                                                                                  
             The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
             pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.          
                                                                                  
       17.   Taxation                                                             
                                                                                  
             The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is
             potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered
             by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of
             Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable
             purposes.                                                            
                                                                                  
             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
             included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
             cost.                                                                
                                                                                  
             The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial
             organisation.                                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       18.   Reserves                                                             
             Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
             which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
             must hold in perpetuity.                                             
                                                                                  
             Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
             therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.      
                                                                                  
       19.   Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
             In preparing these financial statements the College has made the following judgements:
                                                                                  
          a) As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is recognised as a
             liability on the balance sheet. The provision is currently based on the USS deficit recovery plan agreed
             after the 2017 actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of future
             salaries between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each
             triennial valuation of the scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future
             salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out
             in note 28.

           Along with all other staff of the College, the Master received the national pay award of 2.0% from August
           2018.                                                                  
           The Governors agreed alternate pension arrangements for the Master in 2016/17. The College continues to
           contribute 2.1% of salary towards the USS pension deficit - the same percentage as for all members of the
           scheme.                                                                
                                                                                  
           The Master's basic salary is 9.0 times (2017/18: 9.0) the median pay of staff, where the median basic salary
           is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis for the basic pay of all staff.
                                                                                  
           The Master's total remuneration is 8.4 times (2017/18: 8.4) the median total remuneration of staff, where
           the median total remuneration is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis for the total remuneration of all
           staff.                                                                 
                                                                                  
           In calculating the basic salary and total remuneration ratios we have excluded agency and atypical workers'
           salaries as permitted under the 2019 accounts direction (OfS 2019.41).

           Remuneration of the Master                                             
                                                                                  
           The Master’s remuneration has been determined and reviewed through appropriate and robust processes in
           terms of independence, objectivity, and assessment of individual and overall institutional performance.

           The Master’s remuneration has been set and reviewed by a remuneration panel comprised of independent
           Governors. The panel includes the Chair of Governors, but in accordance with good practice, is chaired by
           another independent Governor. The Master is not a member of this panel and does not attend or participate
           in its meetings or business. The panel is supported by the College Secretary & Clerk to the Governors and,
           additionally, advice is provided, or commissioned, by the Director of Human Resources.

           • The panel reviews the remuneration of the Master annually in the light of the following information:
                                                                                  
           • Sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other sources for a range of
             relevant comparator institutions.                                    
           • Retention and continuity of senior leadership through a period of profound challenge and transformation
             for the College has been a priority, thus additional institutions have been added to the benchmarking
             profile to support objective consideration of retention issues.      
                                                                                  
           • The outcome of the Master’s annual appraisal conducted by the Chair of Governors. This is a formal
             documented process in which annual objectives are set and performance against those objectives are
             reviewed.                                                            
                                                                                  
           • The broader context provided by institutional performance information and institutional KPIs agreed by
             Governors.

           The Master last received an increase in base salary, over and above the level of the national pay award, in
           2012. He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. The Master’s current salary reflects sustained quality
           and continuity of leadership over a 15 year period which has had transformational impact. The College has
           met, managed and overcome major strategic threats - the loss of 40% of core teaching funding due to
           government policy change in 2007 and the fundamental 60% decline in traditional part-time study post
           2012. The College’s distinct mission stands out in the sector: widening access, opportunity and flexibility for
           students in an environment informed by the best research. Birkbeck is one of only twenty UK institutions that
           rate highly in both REF and TEF. Delivering successfully on its mission in this environment has required the
           College to restructure, reposition, re-invent and innovate. The Master’s role in delivering this change,
           operating in a long-standing, collegial environment, building the widest base of support amongst students,
           staff, stakeholders and funders, has been vital to the viability and success of the College.

           During the year the Remuneration Committee took the decision that the 2019/20 pay review processes for:
           Senior College post holders – the Master, Vice Master, Pro Vice Masters, College Secretary and Executive
           Deans; and, Professorial and Director level Professional Services staff will not run this year.
                                                                                  
           The Committee recognise the ongoing contribution from senior staff but equally view it as important that
           there is visible leadership from the College’s senior management and the senior members of the College
           community in the current climate. In reaching this decision the Committee was mindful both of the position of
           the College and the broader guidance from the Office for Students in relation to pay restraint when
           considering the pay of senior staff.                                   
                                                                                  
           Severance Payments                                                     
                                                                                  
           During the year the Institution undertook significant restructuring which resulted in £3,308k in compensation,
           91 employees. (2017/18: £401k, 20 employees).                          
                                                                                  
           All compensation for loss of office in respect of higher paid staff are approved by the College's Remuneration
           Committee. Amounts for compensation for loss of office and redundancy for all other staff are approved in
           line with the scheme and in accordance with delegated authority.

           Pension provision                                                      
           The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the
           contractual obligation with the USS to make deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. In
           calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the
           duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out in note 29.
                                                                                  
           The adoption of the new deficit recovery plan following the 2017 actuarial valuation has given rise to a
           significant increase in the deficit provision which has increased from £11.1 million to £31.9 million. See
           also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs. More details on the 2017 actuarial valuation are
           set out in note 28.                                                    
                                                                                  
           Since the year-end, following the completion of the 2018 actuarial valuation, a new deficit recovery plan has
           been agreed. This amends the existing deficit recovery plan as set out in the 2017 valuation Schedule of
           Contributions. This new plan requires deficit payments of 2% of salaries from 1 October 2019 to September
           2021 and then 6% of salaries from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2028. As at 31 July 2019 and assuming all
           other assumptions used to calculate the provision remain unchanged, this would have resulted in a revised
           provision of £18.2 million, a decrease of £13.6 million from the current year-end provision. The decrease in
           provision would result in a lower charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of £7.5 million giving a
           revised total deficit of £13.2 million.                                
                                                                                  
           Other provisions - restructuring                                       
           During the year the Institution undertook significant restructuring which resulted in £3,308 thousand in
           compensation, 91 employees. (2017/18: £401 thousand, 20 employees). A provision has been recognised
           for amounts agreed due to be paid after the year-end.

           All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any significant
           personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the composition of the
           Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations) it is inevitable that
           transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of staff may have an interest.
           During the year the group entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related parties.
           Transactions entered into, and balances outstanding at 31 July 2019 are as follows:
                                                                                  
           The College has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 102 and has not disclosed transactions with its
           wholly owned subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Limited.

       for the year ended 31 July 2019

           The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students' Union
           as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £340,000
           (2017/18: £360,000) was provided to the Union.                         
           During the year a loan of £175,000 was issued to the Students' Union. The loan was issued to support the
           Students' Union return to a position of financial sustainability. The loan is repayable over seven years, no
           interest is due.                                                       
                                                                                  
           At the year-end a balance of £83,000 was due to the Students' Union (2017/18: £21,000)

           As set out in Note 28 in respect of the USS pension scheme, a new schedule of contributions based on the
           2018 actuarial valuation has been agreed. Using the adjusted discount rate of 1.3%, this results in a decrease
           of £13.6 million in the provision for the obligation to fund the deficit on the USS pension which would instead
           be £18.3 million. This adjustment will be reflected in the College's financial statements for the year ended 31
           July 2020.

           Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
           •Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS); and                        
           • The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL).  
                                                                                  
           Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered
           funds.                                                                 
           The total cost charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure was:

           The institution participates in Universities Superannuation Scheme. The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,
           providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme
           are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are
           not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore
           exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of
           the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by
           Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a
           wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
           the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery
           Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution
           recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate
           to the deficit) and therefore an expense is recognised.

       28  Pension schemes (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of
           a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme
           is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such
           as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer
           has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results
           in the recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that
           they relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS
           102. College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a
           multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual
           contributions under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2017 (the
           valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method. A valuation as at 31 March 2018
           was underway but not complete. Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income
           Builder assets and liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities
           as a whole.                                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The 2017 valuation was the fourth valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime
           introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to
           have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of
           the assets of the scheme was £60.0 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £67.5
           billion indicating a shortfall of £7.5 billion and a funding ratio of 89%.
                                                                                  
           In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its
           obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).
                                                                                  
           The key financial assumptions used in the 2017 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the
           Statement of Funding Principles.

           The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based
           on analysis of the scheme's experience carried out as part of the 2017 actuarial valuation. The mortality
           assumptions used in these figures are as follows:

           The provision figures have been produced using the following assumptions as at 31 March 2018 and 2019.
                                                2019         2018

           Pensionable salary growth             n/a          n/a                 
                                                                                  
           Pension increases                   2.11%        2.02%                 
           A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2017 valuation and is set out in the new Schedule
           of Contributions dated 28 January 2019. This requires payment of 5% of salaries over the period 1 April
           2020 to 30 June 2034. In accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 and the SORP, the College has
           made a provision for this contractual commitment to fund the past deficit. In the prior year, the deficit
           payments were 2.1% of salaries up to March 2031.                       
                                                                                  
           This significant increase in deficit contributions has given rise to a substantial increase in the deficit
           provision which has increased from £11.1 million to £31.8 million as set out in note 19.
                                                                                  
           The 2018 actuarial valuation was finalised after the year-end which indicated a shortfall of £3.6 billion and a
           funding ratio of 95%.

       28  Pension schemes (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           Since the year-end, following the completion of the 2018 actuarial valuation, a new deficit recovery plan has
           been agreed. This amends the existing deficit recovery plan as set out in the 2017 valuation Schedule of
           Contributions. This new plan requires deficit payments of 2% of salaries from 1 October 2019 to September
           2021 and then 6% of salaries from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2028. As at 31 July 2019 and assuming all
           other assumptions used to calculate the provision remain unchanged, this would have resulted in a revised
           provision of £18.2 million, a decrease of £13.6 million from the current year-end provision and a lower
           charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of £7.5 million.       
                                                                                  
           (ii)The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL) 
                                                                                  
           The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the
           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the S2P.
                                                                                  
           SAUL is an independently managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
           institutions with links to higher education.                           
           Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on either a final salary basis or a career average
           revalued earnings (“CARE”) basis. Following a consultation with members, it was agreed that the final salary
           section would close from 31 March 2016 and all members would subsequently build up benefits on a CARE
           basis.                                                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations
           under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the
           amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
           spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.
                                                                                  
           SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
           the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The trustees adopt
           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits
           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from members’ accrued
           pension rights to be met.                                              
           The assumptions used to calculate the Technical Provisions include appropriate margins to allow for the
           possibility of events turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not
           completely remove the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the
           future.                                                                
                                                                                  
           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.
           Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        
                                                                                  
           The funding principles were reviewed at SAUL’s next formal valuation in 2017. The valuation confirmed that
           there is no deficit to correct and as a result no further recovery plan contributions or provision is required.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The trustees and employers agreed that the Technical Provisions deficit at the 31 March 2014 valuation will
           be addressed by employer contributions of 3% of salaries between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2018
           (inclusive). As a result the overall level of the employers’ contributions increased from 13% of salaries to
           16% of salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.
