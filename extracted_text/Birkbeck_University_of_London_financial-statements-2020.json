As a consequence, most of our students are\n          mature and have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The fact that we are\n          different from the majority of higher education providers in the UK (who mostly teach young\n          undergraduates during the day) often means that Government policy and other external factors\n          have a different, and often unexpected, influence on Birkbeck. As an example, the advent of the\n          Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) policy and the 2012 undergraduate funding changes,\n          resulted in significant shifts in our student profile. As a specialist part-time study institution, we\n          were forced to quickly develop and introduce full-time evening programmes in 2010 as a risk\n          mitigating strategy against the policy changes which did not affect predominantly full-time\n          universities. Our part-time undergraduate population contracted by over 60% with full-time\n          evening degrees compensating for this decline. The College now has around 3,200 full time\n          equivalent (FTE) full-time undergraduates including those studying a foundation year (from\n          around zero in 2009) and 1,500 FTE part-time undergraduates (falling from 3,800 in 2011/12).\n          The coronavirus pandemic has hit all sectors of the UK economy in 2020 and changed the lives\n          of billions of people worldwide. In late March we moved all teaching materials on-line and swiftly\n          engaged with staff to ensure that they had the facilities to be able to work remotely. Although all\n          UK universities ultimately took the same course of action we were very mindful that many of our\n          students might be in groups at higher risk of contracting the virus, who were caring for vulnerable\n          family members or who were experiencing challenges with their employment. The safety of our\n          staff and students has been paramount as we implemented revised policies and ways of working.\n                                                                                  \n          Recognising that the Covid-19 outbreak was having an impact on everyone we were one of the\n          first UK universities to introduce a no detriment assessment policy for our students. Where\n          possible, assessments and examinations were moved on line and students were encouraged to\n          complete them. The policy ensures that students who attempted assessment and submitted on\n          time were not disadvantaged by completing assessment during the period of Covid-19 disruption\n          and they did not need to submit a mitigating circumstances claim. The widespread stress and\n          disruption is, therefore, automatically taken into account throughout the whole of our\n          assessment and examining process. For students unable to complete an assessment, or who\n          considered that their performance suffered as a direct result of significant personal or family\n          illness, bereavement or serious personal, emotional or financial challenges, either related or\n          unrelated to the outbreak of COVID-19, they could submit a mitigating circumstances claim for\n          sympathetic consideration by assessment boards.                         \n          Having quickly dealt with the immediate issues brought about by lockdown we developed a\n          Teaching Preparation Project (TPP) overseen by the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education) with support\n          from the Digital Education Team. It was clear to us that irrespective of how other universities\n          approached the Autumn term we would need to consider the unique make up of our student\n          body whilst being flexible enough to be able to quickly respond to changing government\n          guidelines. Our objective for 2020/21 is to ensure that all students are able to complete the\n          whole year of their studies remotely if they wish to or their circumstances require them to. Events\n          on campus, essential access to teaching laboratories for students and access to the library would\n          be made available when it was safe to do so.                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

Over the summer, 500 academic colleagues transformed their modules to ensure that\n          they would be more immersive for students during 2020/21. Elements of self-study remain a\n          core part of the pedagogy for students at Birkbeck but remote study will be led by our research\n          active staff. Rather than face-to-face teaching on campus, in-person teaching on-line will be the\n          norm. The TPP will ensure that all students receive a quality of education that we are proud to\n          deliver, that is consistent across all modules and which should ensure that our students are\n          satisfied with the quality of their educational experience at Birkbeck. \n          Although the Library opened as a space for self-study at the start of the Autumn 2020 term\n          safety measures and remote study will limit access to our book stock for students. To mitigate\n          this, the Library has invested heavily in on-line e-books and digitisation to make sure that reading\n          lists and course materials are available on student devices and computers.\n                                                                                  \n          We have also recognised that many of our students will not have access to suitable work spaces\n          nor adequate digital hardware, software or skills. As well as opening up the self-study space in\n          the Library we have made available funds to support students with financial hardship to\n          purchase suitable IT equipment. To help transition new students to the world of on-line study and\n          to maintain the services that current students need, a number of support mechanisms have\n          been developed and quickly introduced this year including:              \n                                                                                  \n                •  A 3-day on-line Careers Summer Boot Camp was attended by 300 students. In\n                   previous face-to-face versions of these type of activities we would attract a few\n                   dozen students to campus at most. Students save travel time and money\n                   undertaking student support sessions at a time and place of their convenience;\n                                                                                  \n                •  Careers & Employability services traditionally have a 30% attendance rate (from\n                   sign up) to their events but over the summer this attendance figure is more like 60-\n                   70%. Our reach via the on-line careers platform and a new bitesize podcast series\n                   has increased during lockdown;                                 \n                                                                                  \n                •  The Studiosity on-line writing and feedback pilot was extended to cover all taught\n                   students in 2019/20 and has retained over 90% student approval ratings with\n                   users. The service provides students with regular constructive comments on the\n                   style and content of their writing thereby helping them improve consistently during\n                   the year rather than having to await formal assessment feedback;\n                                                                                  \n                •  On-line study skills workshops have attracted 1,558 students so far this summer\n                   with nine more sessions to go (at the time of writing). 80% of students gave the\n                   classes feedback scores of 4 out of 5 or above;                \n                •  Orientation will be fully online this year and comprehensively covers the whole of\n                   the student journey. It has been designed to be applicable to welcome new\n                   students and re-orientate continuing ones. At the time of writing the number of\n                   students working through the 4-5 hours of content is growing daily and forecast to\n                   far exceed the student numbers attending the traditional Saturday Orientation Day\n                   before term starts.                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

Although these interventions were developed\n          to facilitate the move to on-line learning the rates of take-up may confirm that our busy\n          commuter students are looking for on-demand services that wrap around work, caring and study\n          time. Students at Birkbeck have consistently welcomed the learning opportunities that face-to-\n          face interactions with tutors and other students bring and we will retain that, but we will also be\n          analysing whether the move to in-person on-line study provides our unique type of student with\n          additional flexibility that may be welcomed by them for the long term.  \n          Birkbeck was very successful in the 2014 Research Assessment Exercise (REF) submitting 83%\n          of eligible staff with approximately three-quarters of their research being rated either ‘world\n          leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). Although the pandemic has had a significant\n          impact on colleagues’ ability to undertake much of their planned research we believe that all of\n          our eligible staff have acquired the necessary outputs to be submitted to the next REF in 2021\n          where we are aiming for at least the same level of success as in 2014.  \n                                                                                  \n          The pandemic has restricted movement within the UK and abroad and many of our portfolio of\n          research projects have been placed on hold with funding bodies agreeing to no cost extensions.\n          This has reduced the external research income recorded in our financial statements this year\n          although the contribution to overheads is broadly similar to last year. With the majority of our\n          research active staff concentrating on converting their teaching modules as part of the TPP\n          research is recommencing gradually: we ensured that we re-opened our research laboratories as\n          soon as it was safe to do so in a Covid-19 safe way; in September staff could access their offices\n          once again (albeit in a way that followed our safety guidelines); and, although international travel\n          is still heavily restricted at the start of term, other activities such as participant testing is taking\n          place once again. We have also increased the size of our internal Research Innovation Fund as a\n          way to support early career researchers. Academic colleagues will be able to access the fund for\n          a range of needs, including the costs of childcare, to assist with their research during a potential\n          second wave of coronavirus infections.                                  \n          The immediate financial consequences of the pandemic and the possible impact on student\n          recruitment in 2020/21 and beyond, will be discussed in the Financial Review alongside an\n          assessment of the financial sustainability of the College. It is, however, worth reflecting on the\n          fact that the pandemic also interrupted the second year of the College recovery plan.\n                                                                                  \n          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since\n          2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off\n          equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of\n          £5.0 million in 2018/19. The main cause of this was a significant fall in EU students in 2017/18,\n          the first full recruitment cycle after the EU referendum on 23 June 2016. In 2017/18, we\n          recruited nearly 400 fewer EU students than in 2016/17. Although many UK universities\n          experienced a reduction in applicant numbers that year, the effect on Birkbeck was more\n          marked. A high proportion of our students from the EU already live and work in London and it was\n          from this group that we saw the highest fall in enrolments. We believe that this was a direct\n          result of Brexit related uncertainty over employment and residency.     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 11",

In financial terms this\n          equated to a reduction in income of £4.0 million. New enrolments for 2019/20 saw a year-on-\n          year increase of 128 student FTEs (21% year-on-year) and based on application and offer\n          numbers another rise is expected in 2020/21. This is likely to be a “dead cat bounce” effect as\n          students from the EU rush to start their programmes before the UK Government removes their\n          right to loan funding. 2020/21 will be the final year that EU students will receive financial\n          support for their studies and we fully expect numbers to fall drastically from 2021 onwards.\n          Although a fall in numbers is likely, it is possible that charging EU students higher fees may\n          compensate financially although this is a risky assumption. A range of post-Brexit scenarios are\n          being considered as part of our financial planning.                     \n          The Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) has come under pressure financially over the\n          last few years as mortality rates increased and market returns fell. The Pensions Act 2004\n          requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective which aims to have sufficient and\n          appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. The triennial scheme valuation in 2017 and\n          the additional valuation in 2018 had the effect of raising employer contributions to the scheme\n          by 3.1% of payroll to 21.1% with another rise of 2.6% scheduled to come in October 2021.\n          Member contributions will have risen by 3% to 11.0% in the same period if the October 2021\n          increase is introduced. Across the sector it is now estimated that between 18 and 20% of eligible\n          staff opt out of the pension scheme, largely on affordability grounds.  \n                                                                                  \n          A Joint Expert Panel (JEP) was created with equal membership from the University and College\n          Union (UCU) representing members and Universities UK (UUK) representing employers. The JEP\n          made a number of recommendations aimed at re-building trust in the scheme valuation process\n          as well as considering ways to ensure that the scheme was affordable, sustainable and inter-\n          generationally fair. The 2020 triennial valuation (which unfortunately values the scheme at the\n          low point of the pandemic economic downturn at the end of March 2020) will hopefully include\n          some of the JEP recommendations. A consultation on the technical provisions which underpin the\n          2020 valuation has just been commenced by USS. It is quite likely that the latest USS valuation\n          will place further pressure on the College finances and this risk has been included in our long\n          term financial forecasts.                                               \n          The impact on the financial position of the College following lower student income as a result of\n          Brexit and higher staff costs, in part from the increasing contributions to USS, can be\n          demonstrated in Chart 1.                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

All require upfront investment and the\n          primary gains are in terms of depth and quality and improving the experience of students and\n          staff on to a par with the comparator institutions against which we benchmark ourselves. Whilst\n          in the long term there will be financial gains -directly through improved retention and research\n          funding and indirectly as a result of reputational impact – these will not be at a level that in and\n          of itself sustains a higher equilibrium.                                \n          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with\n          turnover of £100 to £250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we\n          are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost\n          pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and\n          student body adds major complexity and inflexibility to our underlying business model. Provision\n          at the heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue\n          other activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity into 15 hours\n          a week in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be\n          addressed.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          More fundamentally, in addition to tuition fee and income, our benchmark competitors currently\n          have significant additional income streams, primarily through campus/facility related income and\n          through knowledge transfer/spin off/commercialisation activities. As we have neither residences\n          nor a science park/innovation hub, we lack these income streams.        \n                                                                                  \n          These comparisons do indicate that in order to function effectively we need to generate\n          additional income streams of our own. Whilst growth based on our existing portfolio is an\n          important part of any recovery plan we also need to spread risk by investing in growth across a\n          range of initiatives.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          To do so, we have looked to our unique mission and unrivalled location and attempted to turn\n          them to our advantage rather than see them solely as drivers of increased cost and complexity.\n          As an institution embedded in the social fabric of a metropolis we are seeking to generate\n          additional activity and income streams aligned with the needs of London’s culture, economy and\n          society.                                                                \n          In tandem with developing additional income streams and increasing student numbers we must\n          also closely manage our staff cost base. We are committed to maintaining promotion and\n          recruitment processes which develop and reward talent. We are also making interventions in\n          relation to our equalities and diversity strategy and looking to integrate and support teaching and\n          scholarship staff who are currently on sessional contracts (some on an open-ended basis as part\n          of an ongoing role, others in response to specific and non-recurrent needs). In this context the\n          adoption of an expectations and workload framework for academic staff, alongside\n          appraisal/review, is a significant development which enables us to ensure that we are using our\n          resources effectively.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The issues of complexity, and the incremental layering of new activities onto pre-existing\n          structures as the College has sought to rapidly adapt, identified in relation to teaching, is also\n          true for the College’s professional and support services and School-based administrations. Whilst\n          elements of this have been and are being tackled with focused reviews of specific processes, the\n          current situation requires a more holistic externally supported review that focuses additionally on\n          organisation, capacity, capability and resource that will inform service planning and delivery in\n          this new climate. Cumulatively both the development trajectory we are proposing, and these\n          initiatives, do constitute a significant level of organisational change.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 14",

The recovery plan assumed a break-even budget for 2020/21, with increasing\n          surpluses thereafter.                                                   \n          The coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of 2020 impacted on our recovery plan in a number of\n          ways but we have been clear throughout that both the rationale and strategy underpinning\n          recovery remained valid. Although we would inevitably have to adapt our plans in the short, and\n          possibly medium, term it was critical that we did not simply say that the required actions were on\n          hold. As indicated by Chart 1, any delay in rebasing staff costs would simply widen the gap\n          between costs and income and make resolution more complicated.          \n                                                                                  \n          To facilitate financial planning conversations internally, we had already separated core business\n          income and expenditure from unusual income and costs such as changes to pension liabilities,\n          restructuring costs, new endowments etc. Although these items are all important, they can be\n          quite volatile from year to year thereby masking the financial performance of the core business.\n                                                                                  \n          We successfully launched a voluntary severance and early retirement scheme in the autumn of\n          2018 and achieved recurrent savings of around £3.0 million in staff costs. A review of the\n          efficiency and effectiveness of administration was scheduled to commence in 2020 backed by\n          benchmark data from the Uniforum methodology (a process used by many Russell Group\n          universities in recent years) although developing action plans to reduce costs has been delayed\n          until the start of 2021 due to the pandemic.                            \n                                                                                  \n          During 2019/20 we had also planned to continue to work with departments with low staff\n          student ratios (SSR) and non-sustainable financial contributions with a view to addressing\n          inefficiencies in costs whilst identifying opportunities to grow income. Similarly, market research\n          had identified departments which could be reshaped to take advantage of the ever-changing\n          needs of employers and students. Although many of the planned interventions could not be\n          progressed as we wished due to the re-focus on responding to the pandemic and the challenges\n          associated with remote working, we have still made progress towards the objectives laid out in\n          our recovery plan.                                                      \n          In particular, with support from the College trade unions, a redeployment scheme was agreed to\n          limit the risk of redundancies. Not all optional modules were converted to on-line mode so some\n          staff, particularly those on hourly paid contracts, had their teaching loads reduced. These staff\n          have been put into a redeployment pool and offered the opportunity to apply for any vacancies\n          that arose across the College. This process of restricting replacements whilst also trying to\n          protect jobs is nevertheless delivering financial savings.              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 15",

Even if estimates are made to reflect the direct financial\n          impact of Covid-19, we still delivered a small surplus compared with a budget deficit of £3.0\n          million. The financial position, along with the potential impact of the virus on future years, is\n          discussed in detail in the Financial Review section of this report.     \n          Although financial recovery will be challenging we are different to most multi-faculty, daytime-\n          teaching, predominantly undergraduate universities. Having demonstrated our teaching quality\n          by achieving a silver award in the Teaching Excellence Framework and our research quality from\n          a highly successful Research Excellence Framework assessment, this coupled with our unique\n          mode of delivery gives us strong encouragement that we will successfully achieve our ambitious\n          plans.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          We were pleased to see a recognition in the Augar report that falling part-time student numbers\n          needed to be reversed. We have lobbied long and hard since 2012 and believe that a lifelong\n          funding scheme that supports mature learners to upskill, change career or indeed to enter higher\n          education for the first time is essential. At the beginning of October 2020 we welcomed the\n          Government’s announcement that it is to create a new four-year lifelong learning allowance and\n          to provide loans for students to cover the fees of studying on short courses. Whilst we are still\n          waiting for the details of these new initiatives to be published, they are promising moves that\n          reflect changes which we have been pressing the Government to introduce. On the back of this\n          government proposal we will once more reinforce the need to abolish the rule that prevents\n          someone from doing a higher education qualification that is at the same level or lower than those\n          that they already have (ELQ).                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Awards                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research\n          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution.

This follows Professor Joanna Bourke’s appointment as Professor of\n          Rhetoric at the college last year. By gaining the role, Professor Hart joins a number of major\n          figures in mathematics who have been appointed Gresham Geometry Professors in the past,\n          including Henry Briggs, Robert Hooke, Karl Pearson, Sir Roger Penrose, and John D Barrow.\n                                                                                  \n          Professor Hart is an active researcher, publishing mainly in the area of pure mathematics known\n          as group theory, which has many applications both inside and outside of mathematics, for\n          example in coding theory and cryptography. Professor Hart is also Vice-President of the British\n          Society for the History of Mathematics and a keen mathematics communicator, speaking to a\n          wide variety of audiences at numerous public lectures and talks in schools on topics such as\n          mathematics and art.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 16",

The Chairs are named after French diplomat Jean\n          Monnet (1888-1979), a key figure in the founding of the European Union. \n          Professor Bonnie Wallace, Professor of Molecular Biophysics, has been named the winner of the\n          Royal Society of Chemistry’s Khorana Prize. Professor Wallace won the award for the pioneering\n          development of biophysical methods and bioinformatics tools to enable the characterisation of\n          ion channel-drug molecule complexes. Professor Wallace’s lab was the first to determine the\n          three-dimensional (crystal) structure of an open, active, full-length sodium channel, and to\n          identify the locations of the three sodium ions within the channel selectivity filter, and the\n          features that define their unique specificity for sodium versus other types of ions. This\n          information is helping guide the development of new pharmaceutical drugs.\n                                                                                  \n          The OOpen Library of Humanities project (OLH) was recognised as a ‘force of nature’ in the Open\n          Publishing Awards, with the judges noting that their open access economic model is\n          ‘comprehensive and inspiring.’ The Open Publishing Awards were set up by the Coko Foundation,\n          an organisation that facilitates the scholarly communications sector to take control of their\n          infrastructure.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          The OLH is an online publishing platform founded by Dr Caroline Edwards and Professor Martin\n          Eve from the Department of English, Theatre and Creative Writing. It was created to address the\n          issue of high subscription costs for academic journals and the ‘serials crises’ in the sector, as\n          library budgets struggle to keep up with the prices set by the publishers. The platform recognises\n          that humanities subjects are not afforded the same level of funding as STEM subjects and seeks\n          to redress this disadvantage by getting funding through a model of Library Partnership Subsidies,\n          instead of Article Processing Charges, to fund a number of journals and its own multidisciplinary\n          journal. Since its conception, the platform has gained a number of supporters throughout the\n          world, ensuring its success as a sustainable platform.                  \n          Professor Sir Roger Penrose OM was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work carried out\n          at Birkbeck in the 1960s that demonstrated that black holes were an inevitable consequence of\n          Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. The award is shared with Professors Rheinhard Genzel\n          and Andrea Ghez for their experimental discovery of a supermassive black hole at the centre of\n          the Milky Way.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n          Penrose was appointed Reader of Applied Mathematics at Birkbeck in 1964 and made Professor\n          two years later. In between these events, in 1965, he published a seminal mathematical proof\n          that a singularity in space-time will occur in a gravitational collapse of a massive star. It is for this\n          work that he has been awarded the Nobel Prize.                          \n                                                                                  \n          Dr Mark Williams, Director of the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology's Biophysics Centre\n          at Birkbeck reflected that: \"It’s always an honour as a present member of staff to reflect on the\n          long and continuing tradition of outstanding science here at Birkbeck.

We can all hope for such inspirations!\"                     \n          Birkbeck’s first female professor, DDame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan has been commemorated with a\n          blue plaque at Flat 93, Bedford Court Mansions in Bloomsbury – her London home near the\n          College for almost 50 years. Professor Gwynne-Vaughan was a prominent English botanist and is\n          recognised for her significant contributions to military and public service. After becoming Head of\n          the Botany Department at Birkbeck in 1909 she gained her professorship in 1921. Across the\n          capital, over 900 plaques on buildings- humble and grand- honour the notable men and women\n          who have lived or worked in them. Only 14 per cent of London’s blue plaques celebrate women, a\n          matter which English Heritage is seeking to address.                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Estates                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary space,\n          to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to improve research\n          facilities. Governors approved an Estates Strategy which determined that a number of projects\n          were required to improve the quality of our research and teaching space and also to increase the\n          amount of teaching space that was under the direct, or shared, control of the College.\n                                                                                  \n          A governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards\n          (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design teams,\n          senior College staff and independent Governors) which feed in to the Strategic Estates &\n          Infrastructure Committee (a sub-committee of Governors). The structure aims to ensure that all\n          aspects of each project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is\n          obtained, the building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on\n          major projects are also provided to each meeting of the Finance & General Purposes and Audit\n          committees to provide assurance that all risks are being appropriately managed.\n          For the past twenty years, the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development’s (CBCD) BabyLab has\n          been investigating the psychological processes in infants’ brains and they have uncovered major\n          insights into child development. The BabyLab scientists have identified the earliest marker of\n          autism in babies, examined the links between Down’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease and\n          investigated the effects of screen time on babies as young as six-months-old. A purpose built\n          ToddlerLab to extend the research of CBCD to older children is scheduled to open in late 2020.\n                                                                                  \n          The ToddlerLab will be equipped with sophisticated wireless technology which allows toddlers to\n          carry out normal activities while tracking their brain activity and monitoring their behaviour. An\n          example of the cutting-edge technology is a virtual environment known as the “CAVE” which\n          simulates real-world surroundings, such as a farm or a supermarket, and monitors how toddlers’\n          brain activity changes depending on the world around them.              \n                                                                                  \n          In April 2018 the College received planning permission from the London Borough of Camden to\n          renovate and extend a 1920’s building, called Cambridge House, on Euston Road. London-based\n          architect, Penoyre & Prasad, added a copper-clad two-storey lecture theatre to the top of the\n          existing structure to create a flexible and high quality teaching space. The plans also include a\n          café and active learning space on the ground floor and basement and teaching classrooms on\n          the upper floors. The building will add around 440 square metres of additional teaching space to\n          the College building portfolio providing capacity for over 600 students and staff. Construction\n          commenced in 2019 with the building due to open in early 2021.          \n                                      Page 18",

Design works were commenced in 2019 to repair and improve the terrace in\n          Gordon Square to ensure that it provided suitable space for staff and students for the\n          foreseeable future. Although Governors have allocated budget to conclude the current phase of\n          design it is likely that the impact of the global pandemic on our cash flow will result in a delay to\n          the construction phase. The position will be reviewed in the Spring of 2021 when the cash\n          position is better understood. We will also need to consider whether building projects identified\n          pre-pandemic still provide the most effective solutions to support our post-pandemic strategy.\n          Short term interventions to ensure that Gordon Square remains safe to occupy may need to be\n          developed.                                                              \n          In addition, we need to continue to invest in long term maintenance, infrastructure and capital\n          equipment. Improvements were made during the summer of 2020 to the College IT system to\n          facilitate the move to remote working and teaching. Aspects of network security were also\n          improved to reduce the increased external risks likely from remote working. Critical projects to\n          replace the roof, windows and heating at our main building in Malet Street are also being\n          prioritised over the next 24 months.                                    \n                                                                                  \n          With many competing priorities and a financial plan that is based on consolidation and recovery,\n          the College is carefully considering its position. The key objectives outlined in the original Estates\n          Strategy remain valid, and Governors are keen to invest in the estate where it benefits teaching\n          and research. However, the timing and scale of estates projects will continue to be measured\n          against affordability criteria by the Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committee.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Gender pay gap                                                          \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to\n          operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which\n          rewards staff in line with the College commitment to equality and diversity. The Gender Pay Gap\n          report is produced each year as part of our ongoing commitment to monitor gender equality and\n          diversity pay issues in our workforce. We have been publishing equal pay audits since 2009 and\n          continue this practice in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific\n          Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on certain metrics\n          annually. Despite the UK Government suspending formal reporting in March 2020 due to the\n          pandemic we still completed our report on this important matter.        \n          In addition to the mandatory annual Gender Pay Gap report, Birkbeck also undertakes a full pay\n          audit periodically (most recent 2018) to provide analysis and recommendations in relation to\n          reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the institution.

We remain committed to further progress on equal pay and have set out both an\n          action plan and monitoring targets.                                     \n           Publication      Mean bonus pay  Median bonus pay Total receiving bonus\n           ddate       Femaale ((£) Male (£) Female (£) Male (£) Female Male      \n                                                                                  \n           March 2019     1,046   1,870      941    1,070     2.9%  2.2%          \n                        Gender pay gap 44.1% Gender pay gap 12.1% Total receiving bonus\n                                   lower             lower            49          \n                                                                                  \n           March 2020     1,156     835    1,163     689      3.0%  1.8%          \n                        Gender pay gap 38.3% Gender pay gap 68.8% Total receiving bonus\n                                  higher            higher            46          \n          Table 2: Gender pay gap – bonus pay                                     \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck makes a relatively low number of bonus payments in comparison to the wider sector -\n          the sector average is 8.4% of staff receiving a bonus payment, at Birkbeck it is 2.4%. We operate\n          a number of contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different conditions\n          required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to demonstrate\n          excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal circumstances and all\n          committee members undertake both formal equality & diversity and unconscious bias training.\n          Reward scheme data is annually reviewed by the College for equality & diversity issues in\n          application and success rates.                                          \n                                                                                  \n          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in\n          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal\n          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the\n          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted\n          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena\n          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the\n          academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application\n          and promotion rate of women to more senior academic roles. Work continues on this issue.\n          The College Equal Pay Audit 2018 examines gender but also includes analyses of pay gaps by\n          ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. The full report, which includes actions and benchmark\n          data, can be found at http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/equality/equal-pay-audit\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2019\n          to 31 March 2020                                                        \n                                                                                  \n          The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1\n          April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a\n          range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility Time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the\n          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when\n          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open\n          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.\n                                      Page 20",

Last year 515\n          students benefitted from the support, guidance and advice given by our 324 volunteers who gave\n          a total of 5,050 hours of time (a 36% increase from 2018/19).           \n                                                                                  \n          Whilst the pandemic has caused adverse circumstances and uncertainty for so many of our\n          students, staff, alumni and donors, it has shown the real and pressing need for flexible support.\n          We are confident that our community will continue to come together to provide vital funding and\n          expertise to ensure that Birkbeck students and researchers continue to have access to the tools,\n          support and services that enable them to thrive.                        \n                                                                                  \n          As we move towards our 200th anniversary in 2023, our alumni and supporters will be vital in\n          helping us to achieve our ambitious strategic priorities. Over the coming year we will broaden our\n          fundraising activity, deepen our relationships with current supporters and attract new donors to\n          support these ambitions.                                                \n                                                                                  \n          As the new academic year begins I am pleased to reflect on the remarkable ways in which the\n          College community has worked together to support each other to address and overcome the\n          unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that Covid-19 has presented over the past six\n          months. There will undoubtedly continue to be many more challenges ahead. It would be\n          remarkable if everything were to run smoothly without any hiccups this term but by continuing to\n          work together, I am sure that we will be able to overcome them. After months of hard work by\n          staff across the College, we should all be extremely proud of the largely virtual university that we\n          have launched. The high-quality online platform that we have developed, backed up with in-\n          person sessions where they are required, such as for laboratory practical sessions,\n          complemented by bookable campus facilities, will allow our students to continue to benefit safely\n          from the full Birkbeck learning experience during the pandemic.         \n          Birkbeck, like other Universities up and down the country, has been through a tumultuous period\n          in the unprecedented situation caused by the pandemic. It is testimony to the collective effort of\n          all our staff that we are emerging in a much better position than many other Universities, having\n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 23",

It must be recognised that this\n          would not have been possible without the commitment to Birkbeck and its unique mission which\n          is shared right through the staff community. Academic and professional staff have had to work in\n          new ways as in an emergency we have shifted to largely remote working and online teaching\n          delivery, and the levels of flexibility that we have shown in adjusting workloads and workstreams\n          to cope with new needs has not been easy, Nevertheless, it has been vital in our reaching the\n          position that we are ending 2021 in. There clearly are challenges ahead as we progress through\n          the next stages of the pandemic and emerge into a new demographic and economic context\n          shaped by Brexit and Covid-19 impacts on London. However, in our emergency response we have\n          learned about the potential of operating in different ways and now is the moment for us to be\n          bold, to think through which aspects of our pandemic response could bring lasting benefits in\n          embedding flexibility for students and staff and to develop a new Birkbeck model that meets the\n          future needs of our city and country.                                   \n          A number of lay governors as well as staff and student members of our governing body stood\n          down this year after reaching the end of their terms. They have all given freely of their time,\n          experience and energy and have shown real support and commitment to the College and the\n          unique services it provides. I thank each and every one of them for their roles in moving the\n          College forward. Replacement lay governors have been identified with the assistance of an\n          independent search consultant and will join incoming staff and student representatives chosen\n          by relevant standing orders. We look forward to welcoming them all in the autumn.\n                                                                                  \n          Following a range of discussions across the College it has been agreed that the historic title of\n          Master of Birkbeck will be changed with immediate effect to Vice-Chancellor. All colleagues\n          agreed that Vice-Chancellor more appropriately reflected the role being undertaken by the head\n          of institution at a university in the 21st Century. Birkbeck is a member of the University of London\n          and the role of Vice-Chancellor has previously been reserved to the head of the university and\n          was not available to the member colleges. Draft legislation has been prepared to allow\n          constituent colleges to also use the Vice-Chancellor title if they wished but passage through\n          Parliament has been delayed due to the virus. We are grateful to the current Vice-Chancellor for\n          agreeing to the use of the title whilst we await the formal approval.   \n          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George\n          Birkbeck set out his vision: ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of\n          knowledge’ This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have\n          made between, work, study, culture, research and society. As we move into a post-pandemic,\n          post-Brexit world and approach our third century we will continue to offer transforming\n          educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial, practical or\n          otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will shortly commence cross-College\n          discussions to update our strategy for the next five years to both build on the remarkable on-line\n          developments of the summer and to ensure that we are positioned to meet the needs of our\n          future students. We will work closely with employers and government to assist with the up-skilling\n          and re-skilling of individuals which will be vital to the recovery of the regional and national\n          economy. Within an increasingly volatile operating environment, we will maintain and develop our\n          distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and\n          better space and facilities for all of our activities.                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Professor David S.

The principal activities undertaken by the Group are teaching and\n          research together with ancillary activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include\n          rendering academic services to a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations.\n                                                                                  \n          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of\n          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in\n          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard\n          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,\n          has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are\n          prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed\n          assets and derivative financial instruments).                           \n          The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on families, businesses and economies\n          across the world. Education has been curtailed during the period of lockdown and examinations\n          have been severely disrupted. This has led to direct and indirect financial consequences for UK\n          universities including Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.\n                                                                                  \n          At the beginning of the year we acknowledged that the virus would create disruption and\n          uncertainty so adapted both the management accounts for the year and the future forecasts.\n          Having returned an underlying deficit (before pension and other adjustments) in 2018/19 the\n          College had developed a plan to return to surpluses within three years. Although focus would\n          need to be shifted to dealing with the immediate issues thrown up by the pandemic it was also\n          important to maintain progress towards recovery. Estimates for the direct financial impact of the\n          pandemic during both 2019/20 and 2020/21 were separated from the underlying “business as\n          usual” position to facilitate discussion and decision making. This Financial Review will comment\n          on the business as usual position and the financial impact of the pandemic. Comment will also\n          be provided on pension and other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of\n          Comprehensive Income and capital expenditure.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 25",

Teaching grant now represents only 4.3% of College income in comparison\n          with 47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in\n          2005/06 to 65.5% in 2019/20 (up by £3.8 million on 2018/19).            \n          Recurrent grant from Research England rose by £0.7 million in 2019/20, an increase of 7.3%. In\n          part this related to an additional £138,000 for research support and a one-off additional\n          payment of £274,000. External research activity was affected by the lockdown during the latter\n          part of 2019/20 and a number of projects needed to be suspended. Zero cost extensions have\n          been agreed with most funders in recognition of the enforced delay in delivering outputs. As a\n          consequence, we were unable to recognise income from research grants and contracts to the\n          same extent as in previous years with a fall of £0.4 million compared with 2018/19.\n                                                                                  \n          Whilst the majority of academic and professional support staff across the College were able to\n          work from home successfully a small number of research, nursery, cleaning and facilities staff\n          could not. These staff were furloughed but continued to receive full salary. In line with the\n          guidelines for universities £350,000 was claimed from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme as\n          a contribution towards the salaries of the furloughed staff. This is included in Other Income.\n                                                                                  \n          As an evening provider of higher education Birkbeck rents much of its space to other universities\n          during the daytime and rents space from them in the evening to support the teaching of its own\n          students. With lockdown preventing any activity on campus in the summer term a net loss of\n          rental income of around £0.3 million resulted. Catering income was also impacted falling £0.7\n          million below our budget expectations.                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 27",

After much lobbying by the College since the undergraduate fee was increased in\n          2012, we welcomed the Government’s announcement in October 2020 that it is to create a new\n          four-year lifelong learning allowance and to provide loans for students to cover the fees of\n          studying on short courses. Whilst we are still waiting for the details of these new initiatives to be\n          published, they are promising moves that reflect changes which we have been pressing the\n          Government to introduce. On the back of this proposal we will once more reinforce the need to\n          abolish the rule that prevents someone from studying a higher education qualification that is at\n          the same level or lower than those that they already have (ELQ). Re-skilling and up-skilling of the\n          UK workforce will be critical for post-pandemic, post-Brexit economic recovery.\n          Our strategy to introduce full-time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be\n          seen in Chart 6. We continue to recruit well in a competitive undergraduate market in London\n          despite enrolments being affected by a reduction in EU nationals. Chart 7 starkly demonstrates\n          the significant impact the Brexit referendum in June 2016 had on recruitment of EU nationals\n          with numbers falling by 18.4% in 2017/18 (the first full recruitment cycle after the referendum)\n          and a further 12.2% in 2018/19.                                         \n          More recently, we enhanced our access routes to higher education for students without\n          traditional qualifications by introducing a degree with foundation year route. Recruitment has\n          increased dramatically each year giving students an opportunity to commence a university\n          programme which might otherwise have been denied to them.               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 28",

Full-time numbers then fell slightly in 2017/18, partly due\n          to the fall in EU students but also due to increased competition as more institutions advertised\n          the new student loan which had originally been announced close to the start of the 2016/17\n          academic year. Recruitment has increased steadily since then with postgraduate masters\n          students representing 28.9% of total enrolments. Postgraduate enrolments in 2019/20\n          represent an increase of 30.6% over 2015/16 which was the final year pre-loans.\n          Income from full-time Home and EU students increased by £2.2 million arresting the declines of\n          previous years due to the reduction in EU student numbers. Income from international students\n          rose by £0.9 million (an increase of 10.8%) and now represents 8.5% of total income (2018/19:\n          7.9% of total income). International student income has steadily grown over the last five years as\n          we have placed more emphasis on international brand management and awareness. We believe\n          that there is scope for further increases, particularly with the re-introduction of the post-study\n          work visa. Income from full time international students has now increased 37.1% in five years.\n          Income from part-time students rose by £0.7 million – the second year-on-year increase since the\n          dramatic fall in numbers from 2012. It is hoped that developing Government policy with the\n          extension of student loans to short courses will provide the part-time market with overdue\n          reinvigoration.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 29",

The staff now have access to the SAUL pension scheme alongside\n          other benefits associated with being a member of staff at the College. The part year effect of this\n          was to reduce other operating expenditure by £0.5 million with a corresponding increase in staff\n          costs. A review of whether the College can also insource catering staff will continue in 2021.\n          Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and\n          restructuring costs) has been rising consistently over a number of years and has become\n          unsustainable. A Voluntary Severance and Early Retirement scheme was introduced in 2018/19\n          and contributed to the reduction as a percentage of total income in 2019/20 (see Table 3). The\n          College does not own any student residences (which increase income without a corresponding\n          increase in staff costs) so this percentage is one of the highest in the sector.\n                                                                                  \n                                      2016/17  2017/18  2018/19  2019/20          \n                                        £’000    £’000    £’000    £’000          \n                                                                                  \n           Gross salaries               66,369  70,226   73,313   73,942          \n           Movement on pension provision (181)    (660)  20,481  (14,884)         \n           Restructuring costs              -     401     3,308     299           \n                                                                                  \n           Total expenditure on salaries 666,1188 69,967 97,102   59,357          \n                                                                                  \n           Gross salaries (excluding movement 61.1% 64.4% 69.5%    68.0%          \n           on pension provision and restructuring                                 \n           costs) as a percentage of total income                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Table 3: Change in underlying staff costs 2016/17 to 2019/20            \n                                                                                  \n                   Staff costs and tuition income 2015/16  to                     \n                                                                                  \n                                    2019/20                                       \n                                                                                  \n                             80                                                   \n            )m£(                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n            erutidnepxe/emocnI                                                    \n                             75                                                   \n                             70                                                   \n                             65                                                   \n                             60                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                             55                                                   \n                             50                                                   \n                                 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20          \n                Tuition fees       66     68     66      67     71                \n                 Staff costs (excl pension                                        \n                                   64     66     70      73     74                \n                provision and restructuring)                                      \n          Chart 10: Staff costs and tuition income 2015/16 to 2019/20             \n                                      Page 31",

With undergraduate fees fixed by the\n          UK government there is a mismatch between the inflationary increase in income and the\n          additional staff costs. Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking\n          the rise in staff costs. A post-Brexit fall in students enrolling from the EU coupled with increasing\n          pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 10 and directly led to the underlying\n          deficit in 2018/19. In 2019/20, lower staff costs following the VSER scheme coupled with\n          increased student income brought the two lines closer together. We still have some way to go to\n          return a financially sustainable position which delivers underlying surpluses of 5% of income.\n          The coronavirus pandemic closed our campus in April 2020 and required us to quickly move\n          activity on-line for both staff and students. Inevitably, additional costs were incurred as we moved\n          to change the way we worked and delivered education. At the same time, income was affected\n          through the closure of buildings but costs were also saved from a number of sources. It is difficult\n          to ascertain exactly what the financial impact in 2019/20 has been but a comparison of\n          performance from April 2020 against the phased budget can provide some indicators.

With remote working affecting our ability to work with certain\n          academic departments to improve their financial position in the way that we had planned, we\n          needed to revise our approach. In large part progress towards further staff cost savings was\n          achieved not through an additional cost reduction scheme but through a freeze on new and\n          replacement posts coupled with a redeployment scheme agreed with our trade union\n          representatives. This had the effect of increasing staff savings during the year by £0.4 million.\n          Due to the restrictions on travel imposed this year and to recognise the hard work put in by staff\n          to cope with the move to remote working and teaching, our annual leave rules were adjusted for\n          the year. 10 days of leave rather than the usual 5 were allowed to be carried forward. At the end\n          of each financial year we are required to assess the accrued costs associated with untaken leave\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 32",

With an assumption that most staff would have taken less leave this year the\n          accrual was increased by £0.8 million in comparison with previous years. This non-cash\n          adjustment will reverse in 2020/21.                                     \n                                                                                  \n          Our budget for 2019/20 for the College (rather than the Group) aimed for us to move from an\n          underlying deficit of £5.9 million in 2018/19 to a deficit of £3.0 million in 2019/20 (where the\n          underlying position is before: adjustment to pension liabilities; restructuring costs; endowments;\n          profit on sale of fixed assets and gain/loss on investments). The outturn for the year was a\n          surplus of £1.9 million. With an estimated direct pandemic impact of around £1.4 million this\n          meant that the indirect effect, coupled with tighter budgetary control and receipt of income above\n          budget, led to a positive underlying variance of £3.4 million.          \n          In summary, it is likely that even without the pandemic affecting us from the start of 2020 we\n          would have achieved a break-even underlying outturn for the year.       \n                                                                                  \n          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2017 with the effect\n          that the scheme deficit increased. A repayment plan was agreed in 2018/19 and the College\n          recognised the increase in its share of the pension liability. This had the effect of reducing total\n          comprehensive income for the year by £20.7 million. A joint Expert Panel (JEP) was set up with\n          members representing employers and members to review the assumptions used in the valuation.\n          A follow up valuation was undertaken at 31 March 2018 using slightly amended assumptions\n          recommended by the JEP. These assumptions led to a reduction in the scheme deficit and a\n          recovery plan with a slightly extended repayment period. The resulting impact on the College total\n          comprehensive income was an increase of £14.9 million. Although the pension schemes have a\n          material impact on the financial position of the College, the valuations create volatile changes to\n          the reported staff cost figures and are, therefore, excluded when we consider underlying\n          performance. A third valuation of the pension scheme is currently being undertaken and is likely\n          to have an impact in the 2021/22 financial year.                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 33",

Recognising the increased\n          competition for students as the UK leaves the EU, our recovery plan forecasts were set on\n          modest student number growth to 9,000 FTE. Although the forecasts prudently capped student\n          numbers against our existing portfolio we believe that there are opportunities and a number of\n          recovery projects were identified to grow and diversify income. At the same time, the recovery\n          plan required tight control over costs and a rebalancing of staff costs, both academic and\n          administrative.                                                         \n          The years of generating surpluses placed the College in a relatively strong position as it\n          embarked on financial recovery. The level of cash accrued provided Governors with assurance\n          that revenue recovery initiatives could be phased and that a couple of years of planned deficits\n          could be supported.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          The arrival of Covid-19 at the start of 2020 and the quick move to lockdown and remote working\n          in April 2020 placed a significant strain on the UK and world economy and all businesses were\n          required to adapt quickly. The College quickly moved to remote working and teaching and then\n          began to develop and introduce plans to provide high quality on-line solutions for our students,\n          not just as a reactionary measure to the coronavirus, but as a longer term solution.\n                                                                                  \n          During the Spring of 2020 not only did we look at our operational plans we also developed\n          financial models to try and understand the short and medium term impact of the pandemic on\n          our finances. A number of underlying principles were agreed with Governors:\n                                                                                  \n            •  We would need to invest to properly develop our response plans, particularly in respect of\n               delivering high quality education and support to our students;     \n                                                                                  \n            •  The pandemic would not alter our underlying structural challenges and we would need to\n               retain a focus on the outcomes articulated in our recovery plan;   \n                                                                                  \n            •  The cash reserves we had built up would provide us with a level of cover although any\n               substantial loss of income would require a reassessment of, and likely delays to, our\n               recovery plans;                                                    \n                                                                                  \n            •  Although there was likely to be a significant negative impact on our financial position due\n               to the pandemic we would not seek to mitigate losses in a single year given the likelihood\n               of a general bounce-back in demand within the next few years.      \n          As a consequence, our financial forecasts were adapted to try and split the direct and indirect\n          impact of the pandemic on income and expenditure from our underlying “business as normal”\n          position. This enabled us to determine how to remain on track against the critical recovery plan\n          we had already agreed whilst overlaying the financial cost of the virus. Using this model, financial\n          forecasts under a range of scenarios were developed for the following 10 years.\n                                                                                  \n          In addition to pessimistic, mid-case and optimistic student recruitment scenarios, a fourth\n          scenario was also developed which acted as a stress test of our continuing solvency ie how many\n          students would we need to lose before we required a significant response to remain solvent and\n          how might we deal with such a scenario. We felt that although this had a low probability it\n          indicated that preparing the ground for an application to the government backed Coronavirus\n          Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) would be a sensible risk mitigation strategy.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 35",

A range of operational interventions were introduced to\n          ensure that applicants and current students were aware of the College strategy for teaching in\n          the Autumn. In simple terms, our messaging from the outset was that you could study the whole\n          of the 2020/21 academic year on-line if you wished through a combination of in-person\n          academic delivery (i.e. live lectures and tutorials) supported by self-study. On-campus activities\n          would be introduced where it was safe to do so but, with the exception of laboratory teaching,\n          these would not be compulsory to attend.                                \n          Our messaging to applicants and returning students was successful and enrolments exceeded\n          all the scenarios we had been modelling.

We expect the number of students from the EU\n          to fall and increases in pension contributions are also being estimated. Once again, a range of\n          scenarios has been considered. Capital plans will be reviewed in the Spring term as the forecasts\n          continue to evolve and at present it is only assumed that critical long-term maintenance will take\n          place. Due to the better than expected performance of both 2019/20 and 2020/21 we do not\n          currently anticipate any going concern issues and will not need to apply for CLBILS support. As\n          such the governors are satisfied that the accounts should be prepared on a going concern basis.\n          The pandemic has been a jolt to the system but our quick and collegial response has led to\n          strong recruitment. We need to continue to work on our recovery plan to return to surpluses of\n          5% of turnover and need to be very mindful that there are further uncertainties on the horizon.\n          We have a healthy cash balance, no loan debt to service and no student residences to worry\n          about so are likely to be in a more comfortable position than a number of higher education\n          institutions. We have a unique business model which has proved to be resilient during the\n          pandemic and which is well suited to take advantage of Government plans to upskill and reskill\n          the workforce to help strengthen the economy. Having rapidly developed a high quality on-line\n          teaching model delivered by research intensive academic staff we believe that we are in good\n          shape to continue to weather uncertainty and develop strategies to take advantage of future\n          opportunities.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n          Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to\n          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit\n          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key\n          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main\n          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        \n                                                                                  \n          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and\n          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,\n          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The\n          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual\n          report on internal control and risk for 2019/20 was presented to the Audit Committee in May\n          2020.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          In the Spring of 2020, KPMG undertook a scheduled review of strategic risk management at the\n          College as part of their internal audit plan for the year. The work to be undertaken was\n          summarised in their report as follows:                                  \n                                                                                  \n          “We will undertake deep dives into a sample of the strategic risks recorded on the risk register in\n          order to assess the effectiveness of their management to achieve a tolerable level of risk. We will\n          consider whether mitigations implemented are appropriate to address the nature of the risk\n          identified, whether actions identified have been implemented as planned and whether they have\n          been effective in reducing the level of risk to an acceptable level.    \n                                      Page 37",

College\n          management agreed to implement a number of recommendations during 2020/21.\n          KPMG also presented a Reflections on Risk Management paper to the May 2020 Audit\n          Committee meeting as a direct response to the risk environment created by the pandemic. The\n          paper identified four stages of response to the pandemic: Reaction, Resilience, Recovery and\n          New Reality. The paper provided a helpful framework for the Committee and College\n          management to consider the heightened risks and develop plans to manage a period of\n          extended uncertainty.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          Rather than add a wide-ranging (and possibly unmanageable) single Covid-19 risk to our risk\n          register we added a number of new columns to each of the separate risks in the risk register to\n          reflect the impact of the pandemic. The columns reflected the risks and our actions across the\n          four phases of response outlined by KPMG. The Resilience phase (the period during lockdown)\n          was also split into financial, operational and academic risk.           \n                                                                                  \n          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved\n          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The pandemic has naturally increased the scores for many of the existing risks in the register and\n          added some addition ones. The top risks for the College for 2020/21 outlined in the annual\n          report are:                                                             \n                                                                                  \n            •  Student recruitment                                                \n               Gross risk 22.50, residual risk 15.00 (2019/20: gross risk 18.00; residual risk 14.00)\n                                                                                  \n               Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance\n               on tuition fees as our main source of income. At the start of the 2019/20 student\n               recruitment cycle we put sustained and considerable effort into marketing and\n               recruitment with a new branding and advertising campaign. Centralised management of\n               routine admissions work which had been done in Schools and Departments was\n               introduced to improve efficiency and speed up the turnaround time of responses to\n               students. Monitoring of applications and offers was undertaken by the new Recruitment\n               Strategy and Management Group with action taken where improvement was needed.\n                                                                                  \n               There is still fierce competition for students among HE institutions, with private and\n               alternative providers joining universities on the OFS register. Coupled with a continuing\n               decline in the number of 18 year-olds many institutions that have not previously been\n               competitors have begun to edge into the more mature student market to maintain their\n               numbers. Despite the increased risks our mitigating actions allowed us to increase\n               numbers slightly in 2019/20 albeit that tuition income ended the year below budget (but\n               within the range allowed for by a contingency).                    \n                                                                                  \n               At the time of updating the risk register, the level of risk for 2020/21 recruitment had\n               been exacerbated by the pandemic: international students may not be able, or wish to,\n                                      Page 38",

A deficit\n               budget was set for 2018/19 and recovery plans were developed which aimed to return\n               us back to an underlying break-even position by 2020/21 (before exceptional\n               adjustments such as changes to the pension liability).             \n                                                                                  \n               In April 2019 the Office for Students published a report titled Financial Sustainability of\n               Higher Education Providers in England which noted: “In a financially challenging\n               environment for higher education providers, and with the UK 18-year old population\n               continuing to decline in the short term, the OfS has particular concerns about the\n               credibility of providers’ student number forecasts. Our analysis suggests that over the\n               next few years the sector in aggregate is assuming a level of growth in student numbers,\n               and related fee income, which is not likely to be achievable.” Analysis of our own\n               enrolment trends concluded that forecasting growth for the College in the current\n               environment was risky and we based our financial forecasts (before the impact of the\n               pandemic) on static student numbers.                               \n                                                                                  \n               Having rebased our student recruitment target to the current level with an aspiration for\n               growth, rather than planning for growth, we focused on efforts to rebuild through the\n               Recovery Programme projects including Degree with Foundation Year, Access to\n               postgraduate taught programmes, digital provision, international programmes and short\n               courses/CPD, and the recommendations of the Student Experience Review.\n                                                                                  \n               Our strategy for reducing costs has led to a revised budget setting process based on\n               centrally agreed instructions rather than relying on amalgamating local plans. Around\n               £3.0 million in staff costs were saved following a Voluntary Severance and Early\n               Retirement scheme in the first half of 2019.                       \n                                                                                  \n               The pandemic has of course impacted on our recovery plans – student income in\n               2020/21 was uncertain when the risk was reviewed and our ability to continue to reduce\n                                      Page 39",

We plan to\n          continue with our current approach on access.                           \n                                                                                  \n          The following sections are taken from the College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to\n          2024/25 as examples which demonstrate our performance against various measures in recent\n          years.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Higher education participation, household income, or socioeconomic status\n                                                                                  \n          We believe that providing part-time and flexible education can facilitate social and economic\n          mobility and we have a long and proud history of enabling learners who may not have previously\n          had the opportunity, to access degree-level study.                      \n                                                                                  \n          The standard measure of participation, POLAR3/4, does not work well in London, with very few\n          postcodes falling into the lowest quintiles despite London having significant areas of deprivation.\n          We, therefore, use the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) as a more robust measure of\n          the socio-economic backgrounds of our students. 61% of all undergraduate entrants come from\n          the lowest two quintiles of IMD deprivation with our own survey data showing a significant\n          proportion living in households with low annual income - 39% of full-time undergraduate students\n          living in households with an annual income of less than £25,000 per annum and 46% of part-\n          time students coming from a household with annual income below £40,000 per annum. These\n          rates have been consistent over a number of years in both full-time and part-time student\n          populations.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n          Attainment of a “good degree” can be a challenge for disadvantaged students. The gap between\n          those from the lowest quintiles and those from the highest at Birkbeck has considerably\n          improved amongst full-time students, from a gap of 17% in 2014/15 to 7% in 2017/18. This gap\n          is smaller than the sector and London averages. The gap in our part-time degree student\n          population is just above the sector average at 16% and is something we are developing\n          strategies to address.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by\n          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In\n          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.\n          We also offer all self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free\n          monthly instalments over the academic year.                             \n                                                                                  \n          Disability                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck admits a much larger proportion of students with disabilities than the sector as a whole:\n          over 23% of our full-time entrants in 2016/17 disclosed a disability compared with 13% in the\n                                      Page 42",

Our disabled students tell us that our\n          evening provision is helpful to them as their conditions often prevent them from travelling during\n          rush hour or attending morning lectures. It is not uncommon for a psychiatric care plan to\n          encourage a patient to embark on studies at Birkbeck as part of their recovery. We welcome this\n          client body and are committed to providing support to ensure a level playing field for such\n          students, to attain further qualifications and change their lives.      \n          When looking at the continuation rates of students with disabilities compared to those without, at\n          Birkbeck they continue at the same rate as, or in the case of part-time, better than students with\n          no disabilities. In fact part-time students with disabilities at Birkbeck continue at a 9% higher rate\n          than their non-disabled peers (in the sector disabled students’ continuation is 6% poorer than\n          non-disabled). This positive gap has been seen consistently over the last few years and is\n          testament to the high levels of support they receive. Attainment of a good degree by disabled\n          students is also higher when compared to their non-disabled peers:      \n                                                                                  \n          Ethnicity                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          Our widening access provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than\n          focusing on ethnicity but as our work is exclusively in London our approach means that we work\n          with high numbers of students from BAME groups. Consequently, our student body is ethnically\n          diverse. While the BAME proportion of London’s population is 40%, 56% of our full-time and 42%\n          of our part-time undergraduate entrants identify as BAME                \n                                                                                  \n          Continuation and attainment gaps between different ethnic groups at the College are being\n          closely monitored and progress has been made over the last few years. As an example, whilst\n          continuation rates for black students are better than the sector average there is still a gap when\n          compared to all other students at the College, particularly for those studying part time (see Chart\n          11).                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Chart 11: Continuation rates                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 43",

Despite this considerable\n          improvement, the current gap, and the equivalent part-time gap of 39%, is concerning. We have\n          undertaken data analysis in order to understand this issue better, looking at factors including the\n          age and subject of study of black students. Through linear regression analysis we find these\n          attributes do not have any significant impact on the attainment of black students at Birkbeck. We\n          calculate that just under a third of the gaps in attainment are attributable to entry qualifications\n          and other student characteristics and that there is an “unexplainable” gap of 18% for full-time\n          and 24% for part-time students. Reducing these gaps in attainment is our main priority in the\n          Access and Participation Plan cycle.                                    \n          The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science               \n                                                                                  \n          According to a report and database recently published by Birkbeck and funded by the Arts and\n          Humanities Research Council, the museum sector in the UK has more than tripled in size since\n          1960, with numbers increasing from 1,052 in 1960 to 3,314 in 2015. The large-scale research\n          project documented and analysed the growth and development of the UK museum sector\n          between 1960 and 2020.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Expansion was mainly driven by the foundation of independent museums: since 1960, their\n          numbers have more than quadrupled and, as of 2017, independent museums made up 71.5% of\n          the sector. The majority of the new museums are also small (defined as having fewer than\n          10,000 annual visits), and now make up 56% of the sector. The rising numbers of small\n          independent museums point to the role of community and special interest groups in driving the\n          museums boom. These groups set up their own museums that address topics important to them.\n          The surge of local history museums is notable in this respect as they now account for almost a\n          quarter of the UK sector.                                               \n                                                                                  \n          In 2016 the number of closures outpaced the number of openings for the first time and since\n          then the sector has contracted. In total, 758 museums closed between 1960 and 2017, which is\n          18.7% of the museums open during this period. In particular, the growth in the number of local\n          authority museums slowed from the 1990s onwards. The assumption that museums survive and\n          that they keep collections for posterity is misplaced. The project director, Professor Fiona\n          Candlin, Professor of Museology at Birkbeck, hopes that the research will shape the design of\n          policy and how we set about further research on the sector in the future\n          A free to use database containing information on over 4,000 museums, resources linked to the\n          project and links to the project publications can be found on the Mapping Museums website.\n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of environmental protection or improvement              \n                                                                                  \n          Research led by Birkbeck’s Dr James Hammond indicates the presence of molten rock beneath\n          the Changbaishan/Mt. Paektu volcano, which was responsible for one of the largest volcanic\n          eruptions in known history -the ‘Millenium Eruption’ of 946 CE. The volcano sits in the\n          China/Korean peninsula. This study was the first cross-border study of the region, and therefore\n          represents a unique scholarly collaboration between the UK, China and the Democratic People’s\n          Republic of Korea (DPRK). Using data from both China and DPRK, Dr Hammond and his\n          colleagues from Beijing, Pyongyang and Cambridge examined the crustal structure underneath\n          the volcano. They found a sharp velocity reduction approximately 7km beneath the volcano,\n          extending approximately 30km from the volcano’s base. This suggests the presence of molten\n          rock beneath the base of the mountain showing the volcano to still be active.\n                                                                                  \n          This new evidence of an active magmatic system highlights the importance of sustained\n          operational surveillance going forward.

It causes economic and social\n          harm, puts pressure on prison conditions and increases the risk of crime. Pre-trial detention\n          statistics held on ICPR’s World Prison Brief database showed that, since 2000, pre-trial prison\n          populations had grown substantially across much of the world. This is despite increased\n          availability of cheaper, less restrictive measures like electronic monitoring. The research included\n          analysis of national legal systems followed by interviews with 60 experienced criminal defence\n          lawyers across ten countries.                                           \n                                                                                  \n          The research identified a number of issues including that people from backgrounds of\n          disadvantage are more likely to be arrested, often don’t have money to pay bail, are less likely to\n          have good legal representation – and for these reasons, are more likely to be detained pre-trial.\n          Aspects of the wider criminal justice ‘machinery’ are also part of the picture: under-resourced\n          police and prosecution services that can’t investigate quickly and effectively; inadequate legal\n          aid; lack of judges and court staff; unmodernised court infrastructure and technology; too few\n          alternatives to custody. All these factors lead to misuse and prolongation of pre-trial\n          imprisonment.                                                           \n                                                                                  \n          The authors hope that governments will address the issues including using cheaper and less\n          restrictive means to ensure that someone turns up to court.             \n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of health or the saving of lives                        \n          Supported by funding from the Wellcome Trust a seven-year, multi-centre research study has\n          shed new light on how a painkiller commonly used by vets for cats and dogs could be repurposed\n          to fight drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). The drug, Carprofen, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\n          drug (NSAID) in the same group of painkillers as ibuprofen and aspirin and was first found to kill\n          the bacteria responsible for TB in research led by Professor Sanjib Bhakta, Professor of\n                                                                                  \n          Molecular Microbiology and Biochemistry, at Birkbeck in 2013. The new study, which has seen\n          Professor Bhakta working alongside scientists from five different research centres, has revealed\n          that the drug most likely works by inhibiting the ‘efflux mechanisms’ that protect bacteria from\n          substances that harm them.                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The research also found that it is not possible to generate bacteria that are resistant to Carprofen\n          and that it most likely kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis through multiple routes. In addition, it\n          found that Carprofen can reverse antimicrobial drug resistance in TB. These important findings\n          offer the promise that, when used in combination with other drugs, Carprofen may prove effective\n          in the fight against both TB and importantly, drug-resistant TB, which can occur when the bacteria\n          become resistant to the two most powerful antibiotics used to treat it. \n                                                                                  \n          Every year worldwide over 10 million people are diagnosed with TB, and 1.6 million die of the\n          disease, mainly because they cannot get the drugs that would make them better.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 45",

Accounting for retirement benefits                                    \n            College staff are members of two principal pension schemes -the Universities Superannuation\n            Scheme (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL).

Each fund is valued\n            every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries.  \n            Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and\n            liabilities of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as\n            a defined contribution retirement benefit schemes.                    \n            A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the\n            schemes.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 61",

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an\n            expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                                                                                  \n            DDefined benefit plan                                                 \n            Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n            defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n            employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n            returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n            the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n            plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n            employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to\n            determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed\n            by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n            recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either\n            through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n       55.  Employment benefits                                                   \n            Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an\n            expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are\n            accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused\n            entitlement.                                                          \n       66.

Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the\n            corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value\n            and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.\n                                                                                  \n            Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the\n            outstanding liability.

Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.          \n            The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is\n            depreciated as follows:                                               \n            Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                            \n                                                                                  \n            Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                         \n            Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years                                   \n            Leasehold land: the life of the lease                                 \n            Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 63",

The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan agreed in the 2018\n            actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of future salaries between\n            1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each triennial valuation of the\n            scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future salary inflations, changes in\n            staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount.

This is a multi-year enhancement programme, accelerated in 2019/20, with\n           a strategic focus of reallocating expenditure from financial support to student success as noted in\n           section four of the 2019/20 access and participation plan. The focus of new activities and resources is\n           on improving student retention and student success.                    \n                                                                                  \n           In the 2018/19 academic year we reviewed our student financial support package and replaced the\n           Birkbeck undergraduate bursary scheme with the Birkbeck Needs Based Assessment (BNBA). The\n           Birkbeck undergraduate bursary scheme was a fixed amount given to all students who met the\n           eligibility criteria whereas the BNBA provides support based on need, on a student’s application. This\n           review was part of the wider move to invest more in student success and outcomes, and less in\n           student financial support.                                             \n           The rationale for this change is that:                                 \n                                                                                  \n           • the introduction of the student maintenance loan for part-time students meant for the first time\n             most of Birkbeck’s undergraduate students had access to funding for living costs. As a result, the\n             blanket application of a bursary to disadvantaged students was no longer appropriate;\n           • internal research demonstrated financial support had no measurable impact on the retention of\n             (cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:86)(cid:30)(cid:3)\n           • our expenditure on student financial support was significantly above benchmark for the sector. In\n             2017/18 over half of our access agreement expenditure was on financial support, and our\n             expenditure was 28.4% of additional fee income (benchmark: 22.5%);   \n           • in the context of the SER - a major review of Birkbeck’s approach to education for all students –\n             the College decided to invest significantly in student success – i.e. support services for students\n             and interventions to support better outcomes.                        \n           The fundamental shift in financial support available (maintenance loans and the introduction of BNBA)\n           introduced considerable uncertainty into modelling both the uptake of BNBA, and the spend per\n           student. The model was based on the Birkbeck bursary scheme and the expectation that most eligible\n           students would apply for the support however the uptake was much lower. This is not linked to\n           eligibility as 90% of students who applied for the support received it.\n                                                                                  \n           We see a similar underspend in 2019/20, chiefly due to:                \n           • the access and participation plan for 2019/20 being submitted in May 2018, before the\n             2018/19 uptake of the BNBA was known;                                \n           • recruitment of undergraduate students in 2019/20 being 8% lower than expected;\n                                                                                  \n           • the introduction of the part-time maintenance loan by the Government for 2018/19 being\n             significantly delayed (students were only able to apply for the scheme from summer 2018) and\n             the availability of the new loans was not widely publicised by government. This meant that the\n             impact of maintenance loans on demand for the BNBA was not properly understood in 2018/19,\n             and using the 2018/19 experience to model 2019/20 was not appropriate;\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 73",

Key assumptions are set out in note 28.\n                                                                                  \n           The adoption of the deficit recovery plan following the 2017 actuarial valuation gave rise to an increase of\n           £11.1 million in the deficit provision at the last year-end. The 2018 actuarial valuation, completed shortly\n           after the 2018/19 year-end, agreed a new deficit recovery plan. This has reduced the provision from £31.9\n           million to £14.4 million.                                              \n           See also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs. More details on the 2018 actuarial\n           valuation are set out in note 28.                                      \n                                                                                  \n           Other provisions                                                       \n           A provision has been recognised for amounts which may become due to be paid after the year-end. This\n           provision relates to restructuring that took place before the year-end.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 80",

The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,\n           providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme\n           are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are\n           not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore\n           exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the\n           underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by Section 28\n           of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a wholly defined\n           contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the\n           contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan)\n           that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a\n           liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit)\n           and therefore an expense is recognised.                                \n                                                                                  \n           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a\n           collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a\n           scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as\n           Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has\n           entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the\n           recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they\n           relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.\n           College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-\n           employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under\n           the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 85",

Pension\n           benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings (\"CARE\") basis.\n           Following a consultation with members the final salary section closed from 31 March 2016 and all\n           members build up benefits on a CARE basis. At the same time that benefits changed, SAUL's employers\n           agreed to increase their ongoing contributions to 16% while the member rate remained at 6%. These rates\n           remain unchanged.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n           The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the(cid:3)\n           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the\n           S2P.                                                                   \n           The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations\n           under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the\n           amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be\n           spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.\n                                                                                  \n           SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by\n           the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The actuarial method\n           used in the calculation of Technical Provisions is the Projected Unit Method and is based on pensionable\n           service. The trustees adopt assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for\n           pensions and benefits already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from\n           members’ accrued pension rights to be met. The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and\n           employers in June 2018 and are due to be reviewed at SAUL's next formal valuation in 2020.\n                                                                                  \n           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and\n           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.\n           Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new\n           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        \n           The valuation carried out as at 31 March 2017 showed that SAUL had assets of £3.2 billion against(cid:3)\n           liabilities of £3.1 billion, representing a funding level of 102% on a Technical Provisions basis. SAUL was\n           fully funded on its Technical Provisions basis so no deficit contributions were required. The cost of accrual\n           was 28.7% versus member and employer contributions of 22%, the difference being known as the\n           contribution strain.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n           SAUL's most recent review undertaken as at 31 March 2019 indicates the scheme's surplus was £104m:\n           equivalent to a funding level of 103% and representing an improvement in the scheme's funding position\n           compared to both the 31 March 2017 valuation and the expected position at 31 March 2019.\n                                                                                  \n           The 2020 valuation is underway with the final outcomes to be agreed by 30 June 2021.\n                                                                                  \n           Details of the scheme and the 2017 valuation can be found at www.saul.org.uk.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 88",
