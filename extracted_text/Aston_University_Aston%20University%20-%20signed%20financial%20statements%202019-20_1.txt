Foreword by                                
                                       Professor Alec Cameron                     
                                       Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                This year has been a challenging year both globally and for the University as we have all had
                to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with our strategy, the beneficiaries
                of the University – students, business and the professions, and our region – have been at the
                forefront of our response to COVID-19 as their future success is critical to us.
                The year started positively with a growing student population as we welcomed students
                from over 120 different countries around the world. Aston has long been recognised
                as a university that equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in
                businesses and the professions and our integrated placement year remains very popular,
                with the majority of our students spending a year in business, a year abroad, or in pre-
                registration for subjects allied to medicine. As we move forward, our focus is on ensuring
                that as many students as possible are able to experience a placement despite challenges
                resulting from COVID-19.                                          
                                                                                  
                In March, with the UK in lockdown and the majority of students having returned home,
                we moved quickly to enable the delivery of teaching and assessments on-line and it is a
                testament to our staff how well this transition was implemented. This was supported by
                investment in our digital infrastructure and this will continue as the University accelerates
                the implementation of our Digital strategy. Our work continues to ensure that we
                maintain our high quality education experience through blended learning.
                We have continued to demonstrate our commitment to research excellence by establishing
                and investing in four University Research Institutes during 2018/19. This, along with our
                focus on collaborative research with high translation and impact, has seen us continue to
                grow our research to £30 million in new research grants, our best result to date. We
                continue to support both businesses and the region through our research, specifically
                focusing on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on society.       
                                                                                  
                During the pandemic the University has worked with a number of our beneficiaries, providing
                accommodation and PPE for key workers, as well as donating food to local charities and
                running a foodbank in connection with Aston Students’ Union.      
                Our financial performance in 2019/20 has been good despite the challenges to our
                commercial operations and delivery of research that arose as a result of lockdown. We have
                continued to invest in our campus provision with an increase in student study space, updates
                to teaching rooms and investment in research.                     
                                                                                  
                Looking forward, we continue to work to ensure that Aston University is as safe as possible
                for all our beneficiaries and staff as we welcome students back on campus for the coming
                academic year.

Statement of principal accounting policies

     These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP):
                                                                                  
     Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2015 and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards (FRS 102).
     The University is a public benefit entity and therefore has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102.
     The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of
     fixed assets).                                                               
                                                                                  
     Basis of consolidation                                                       
                                                                                  
     The consolidated financial statements include the University and all its subsidiaries for the financial year to 31 July
     2020. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Consolidated Statement
     of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. Intra-group
     transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the fair
     value method.                                                                
                                                                                  
     The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Aston Students' Union or Aston
     University Engineering Academy as the University does not exert control or dominant influence over the policy
     decisions for these entities.                                                
                                                                                  
     Going Concern                                                                
                                                                                  
     The Council has considered the University’s academic and financial position, with due regard to its cash flows, liquidity
     and borrowings and the factors likely to impact on future expectations as included in the Operating and Financial
     review above.                                                                
                                                                                  
     The University adopts a cautious approach to financial risk management. Funds are placed in low risk deposit
     accounts. While this limits the amount of return available, it does not expose these essential funds to undue risk.
                                                                                  
     Council believe that the University is well placed to manage its business risk successfully, despite the current
     uncertain economic outlook and student recruitment pressures facing the higher education sector and will continue to
     seek ways to drive efficiencies. Any risk to cash-flow will result in the capital plans being reviewed and amendment as
     required.                                                                    
                                                                                  
     Management have completed a thorough assessment of the appropriateness of the going concern assertion. This has
     included consideration of a number of budget scenarios for 2020/21 in light of Covid-19 and the impact of these
     scenarios and capital plans on cash balances, with these scenarios being extrapolated through five-year plans.
                                                                                  
     Prudent assumptions have been applied, and the capital plan has been re-phased to ensure cash balances are
     maintained through 2021/22 and beyond.                                       
     The University has drawn-down £15m of the agreed HSBC facility, and can draw-down the remaining £25m balance
                                                                                  
     on demand, as such at budget level available funds are not expected to fall below £60m. The start to 2020/21 has
     been positive, and activity has been reforecast accordingly. At both budget and forecast level the University plans to
     meet all debt covenant obligations with significant flexibility in these measures.

     Going Concern (continued)                                                    
                                                                                  
     The University has strong cash balances, uses prudent revenue and cost assumptions in forecasting, has reasonable
     levels of discretionary revenue and capital expenditure and forecasts compliance with debt covenants.
                                                                                  
     As such, Council is satisfied that the University has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable
     future and for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the preparation of the financial
     statements.                                                                  
                                                                                  
     Income recognition                                                           
                                                                                  
     Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and
     Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms of the contract have been
     satisfied.                                                                   
     Tuition Fee Income                                                           
                                                                                  
     Tuition fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the Consolidated
     Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students are studying. Where the
     amount of the tuition fee is reduced, by a discount for prompt payment, income receivable is shown net of the
     discount. Bursaries and scholarships which are not offered as a deduction on fees are accounted for gross as
     expenditure and not deducted from income.                                    
     Investment income                                                            
                                                                                  
     Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure on a
     receivable basis.                                                            
     Funds the University receives and disburses as paying agents on behalf of a funding body are excluded from the
     income and expenditure of the University where the University is exposed to minimal risk or enjoys minimal economic
     benefit related to the transaction.                                          
                                                                                  
     Grant funding                                                                
     Government revenue grants including funding council block grant and research grants are recognised in income over
     the periods in which the University recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Where
     part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income within creditors and allocated between
     creditors due within one year and due after more than one year as appropriate.
                                                                                  
     Grants (including research grants) from non-government sources are recognised in income when the University is
     entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received in advance of
     performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors on the balance sheet and
     released to income as the conditions are met.                                
     Donations and endowments                                                     
                                                                                  
     Donations and endowments are non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions. Donations and
     endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income when the University is entitled to the funds.
     Income is retained within the restricted reserve until such time that it is utilised in line with such restrictions at which
     point the income is released to general reserves through a reserve transfer.

     Income recognition (continued)                                               
                                                                                  
     Donations with no restrictions are recognised in income when the University is entitled to the funds.
     Investment income and appreciation of endowments is recorded in income in the year in which it arises and as either
     restricted or unrestricted income according to the terms or restrictions applied to the individual endowment fund.
                                                                                  
     There are four main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
       •  Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective.
       •  Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested to
          generate an income stream for the general benefit of the University.    
       •  Restricted expendable endowments - the donor has specified a particular objective other than the purchase or
          construction of tangible fixed assets, and the University has the power to use the capital.
       •  Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested to
          generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.      
                                                                                  
     Capital Grants                                                               
                                                                                  
     Government capital grants are recognised in income over the expected useful life of the asset. Other capital grants
     are recognised in income when the University is entitled to the funds subject to any performance related conditions
     being met.                                                                   
     Accounting for retirement benefits                                           
                                                                                  
     The three principal pension schemes for the University's staff are the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS),
     Scottish Widows Pension Scheme (SWPS) and Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). AUPS is now a closed
     scheme to new entrants and future accrual and all existing members now have deferred benefits.
     AUPS is a defined benefit scheme which was externally funded and for the period up to 5 April 2016 was contracted
     out of the State Second Pension (S2P). From 6 April 2016, contracting out ceased with the introduction of the
     Government’s new state pension. The fund is valued every three years by professionally qualified independent
     actuaries. The last formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2019.
                                                                                  
     USS is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits.
     The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the
     scheme, the assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The
     institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify
     its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by
     Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined
     contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions
     payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how
     each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for the contributions
     payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) with related expenses being
     recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.

     Accounting for retirement benefits (continued)                               
                                                                                  
     SWPS is a defined contribution plan, a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed
     contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
     contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive
     Income and Expenditure in the year during which services are rendered by employees.
     Further details on all pension schemes are disclosed in note 26.             
                                                                                  
     Employment benefits                                                          
     Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an expense in the
     year in which the employees render service to the University. Any unused benefits, such as holiday entitlements
     earned but not taken at the balance sheet date, are accrued and measured as the additional amount the University
     expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.                        
                                                                                  
     Finance leases                                                               
     Leases in which the University assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
     classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the corresponding lease liabilities
     are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease
     payments at inception of the lease.                                          
                                                                                  
     Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
     The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of
     interest on the remaining balance of the liability.                          
     Operating leases                                                             
                                                                                  
     Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any lease premiums or
     incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.                           
     Foreign currency translation                                                 
                                                                                  
     Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign
     exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
     at the balance sheet date are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
     Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised within the Statement of Comprehensive Income
     and Expenditure. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
     currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
     denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign
     exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.

     Fixed assets                                                                 
     Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Certain items of
     land and buildings that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 August 2014 are measured on the basis of
     deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation. Depreciation and impairment losses are
     subsequently charged on the revalued amount.                                 
                                                                                  
     Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components for the
     purposes of charging depreciation.                                           
     Land and buildings                                                           
                                                                                  
     Capitalisation: Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after initial purchase or construction, and prior to
     valuation, are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future benefits to the University.
     Depreciation: Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Freehold buildings
     are depreciated on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
                                                                                  
               New buildings and extensions  40 – 50 years                        
                                                                                  
               Refurbishments                10 – 20 years                        
               Building Improvements         10 – 15 years                        
                                                                                  
     Assets under construction are accounted for at cost, based on the value of architects’ certificates and other direct
     costs incurred to 31 July. No depreciation is charged on assets in the course of construction.
     Plant & machinery, fixtures, fittings & equipment, and intangible assets     
                                                                                  
     Capitalisation: Items costing less than £10,000 per individual item (where not part of a larger capital project) is
     recognised as expenditure in the year of acquisition. All other items are capitalised at cost.
     Depreciation and amortisation: Capitalised plant & machinery, fixtures, fittings & equipment, and intangible assets are
     depreciated/amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life as follows:
                                                                                  
               Major Systems and Equipment   5 – 10 years                         
               Computer Equipment and Software    3 – 5 years                     
                                                                                  
               Equipment acquired for specific research projects 1 – 5 years      
                                                                                  
               Motor Vehicles and General Equipment 3 – 5 years                   
     Depreciation and amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of
     each Balance Sheet.                                                          
                                                                                  
     Borrowing costs                                                              
     Borrowing costs are recognised as expenditure in the period in which they are incurred.
                                                                                  
     Heritage assets                                                              
     Works of art and other valuable artefacts and valued at over £10,000 have been capitalised and recognised at cost or
     value on acquisition, where such a valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not depreciated as their
     long economic life and high residual value mean that any depreciation would not be material.

     Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
                                                                                  
     Current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at fair value with movements recognised in the Statement of
     Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.                                        
     Investments in jointly controlled entities, associates and subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the
     University's accounts.                                                       
                                                                                  
     Stock                                                                        
                                                                                  
     Stock is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and is measured using an average cost formula.
     Cash and Cash Equivalents                                                    
                                                                                  
     Cash includes cash in hand, cash at bank, and deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts. Deposits are repayable
     on demand if they are in practice available within 24 hours without penalty. 
     Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amount of cash with
     insignificant risk of change in value.                                       
                                                                                  
     Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets                     
     Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:                  
                                                                                  
       •  the University has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,
       •  it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
       •  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.        
                                                                                  
     The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate
     that reflects risks specific to the liability.                               
     A contingent liability arises from a past event that gives the University a possible obligation whose existence will only
     be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the University.
     Contingent liabilities also arise in circumstances where a provision would otherwise be made but either it is not
     probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably.
     A contingent asset arises where an event has taken place that gives the University a possible asset whose existence
     will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the
     University.                                                                  
                                                                                  
     Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the notes.
                                                                                  
     Taxation                                                                     
     The University is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is therefore a charity
     within the meaning of Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the University is potentially
     exempt from UK Corporation Tax in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered by section
     478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 or section 256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent
     that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable purposes.    
                                                                                  
     The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is included
     in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their cost.

     Taxation (continued)                                                         
     Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that exist at the balance sheet date and that result in an obligation
     to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in
     periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or
     substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets shall be
     recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax
     liabilities or other future taxable profits.                                 
                                                                                  
     The University’s subsidiary companies are subject to Corporation Tax and VAT in the same way as any commercial
     organisation.                                                                
     Reserves                                                                     
                                                                                  
     Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances which, through
     endowment to the University, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the University must hold in perpetuity.
     Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and therefore the
     University is restricted in the use of these funds.                          
     Significant judgements and estimates                                         
                                                                                  
     Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The
     items in the financial statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:
     Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS)                                       
                                                                                  
     The University obtains a valuation from Hymans Robertson LLP who make decisions on behalf of the University on
     the financial assumptions used to calculate the net liability of the scheme. These assumptions include the RPI%,
     CPI%, salary increases, pension increases, mortality rates, discount rate and the estimate of the duration of employer
     liabilities.                                                                 
     The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill and judgement in setting these parameters as the
     pension experts rather than suggesting a rate.                               
                                                                                  
     Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach and
     the full actuarial valuation will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.
     Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)                                     
                                                                                  
     FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a
     collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a
     scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as Universities
     Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has entered into an
     agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the recognition of a liability
     for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the
     resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that USS
     meets the definition of a multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the
     contractual contributions under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
     The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit required in the financial statements has used
     assumptions on staff salary inflation percentages and the percentage change in staff numbers in subsequent years.
     In making the estimated percentages, management considered past movement in salary inflation and staff numbers
     as well as considering the University’s strategic plans, current economic climate and consistency with AUPS
     assumptions.

     Aston University has also chosen to apply the discount rate provided by Mercer Limited actuaries in the USS modeller.
     Mercer Limited have used a set of assumptions to arrive at the discount rate with Aston University accepting the set of
     assumptions as reasonable.

     There are two key areas that require judgement:                              
                                                                                  
       •  the recoverability of aged trade receivables based on the knowledge of the individuals or market. Where
          conditions suggest the full recoverability is doubtful, a provision will be recognised; and
       •  judgements as to whether any indicators of impairment are present for any of the University’s assets.
                                                                                  
     Neither of these judgement areas have resulted in a significant change to the University’s reported performance.

     The median employee salary figure used to calculate the above ratio is based on the annual full time salary of all
     included on the University’s payrolls. This includes all individuals that the University includes in its HESA staff record,
     including any individual service companies who are deemed employees under IR35.
     This excludes agency staff, individuals with honorary contracts where the contract is not deemed to be a contract of
     employment and self-employed individuals outside the scope of IR35. Agency staff are excluded as it is not possible
     with the current systems and processes in place to identify the equivalent annual salary at an individual level. Agency
     staff are used for a range of activities across the University, however, they are often not full-time, are charged for via
     third parties often on a consolidated basis and the rate charged includes a fee to the third party and VAT. Therefore, it
     is not possible to identify an accurate median salary for these individuals.

     The emoluments of the Vice Chancellor above exclude employer's social security. The Vice Chancellor is
     not a member of the USS pension scheme and therefore there were no employer contributions in 2019/20
     or 2018/19. The University made a benefit replacement payment in lieu of pension contributions to USS.
     The performance of the Vice Chancellor is monitored throughout the year including through 1:1
     performance appraisal with the Chair of Council. In previous years Executive officers, including the Vice-
     Chancellor, have had access to an annual bonus based on a combination of overall University performance
     against key performance measures agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the outset of the
     performance cycle and performance against individual objectives agreed with the Chair of Council. The
                                                                                  
     Nominations and Remuneration Committee decided not to award bonus payments to the Vice-Chancellor
     and other eligible members of the University Executive for 2017/18 and to discontinue the Executive Bonus
     Scheme.                                                                      
     In setting the pay of the Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Committee uses a variety of benchmark data
     sets to get a rounded picture of what fair and competitive base pay looks like for the role at Aston
     University. The primary comparison is carried out using several different data ‘cuts’ of the UCEA Senior
     Staff Remuneration Report which provide a well-rounded picture of where the incumbent sits relative to the
     wider Higher Education Sector. The conclusion of that comparison has determined that the base and total
                                                                                  
     reward for the role at Aston is fairly positioned against the market.        
     Additionally, the Remuneration Committee also commissioned an independent external review of senior
     remuneration which reported in September 2018. This included an analysis of the Vice-Chancellor’s reward
     using different metrics to help form a more-rounded picture of the appropriate level of pay when set against
     the University’s performance against a variety of measures. This review also used an analysis against the
     wider private and public sectors to provide a benchmark of levels of pay for senior roles found in these
     markets. This analysis has similarly concluded that the remuneration of the Vice-Chancellor is fair,
                                                                                  
     appropriate and justifiable.

     The total of the approved expenditure in our Access and Participation Plan for the year ended 31 July 2020
     was £5,340,842. Details of the approved 2019/20 plan can be found at         
                                                                                  
     https://www2.aston.ac.uk/about/documents/access-and-participation-plan-2018.pdf.
     2019/20 was the final year that the University planned and operated under the legacy Widening
     Participation categories (Access, Success, Progression and Investment in financial support). The
     £5,340,842 target in the published plan relates to these categories, and against these the University
     exceeded planned spend in year, with actual spend of £5,738,765 (£397,923 over target). Within this there
     was a small underspend against planned Access investment due to the impact of Covid-19.
                                                                                  
     OfS guidance required that spend for 2019/20, while planned based on the four categories noted above
     should be reported using the new categories in place for 2020/21 plans (Access Investment, Financial
     Support to Students, Support for disabled Students and Research and evaluation). As such, only spend
     incurred in 2019/20 that would meet the criteria for inclusion in the new categories is shown above.
     £182,070 of the above figures relate to staff costs for individuals who are intrinsic to the delivery of access
     and participation activity.

     As set out in the Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41), no prior-year comparatives are required.

     funds. The deficit in the schemes is required to be reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
     movements in the deficit to be reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and
     Expenditure.                                                                 
                                                                                  
     SWPS is a defined contribution plan, a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed
     contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
     Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
     income statement in the year during which services are rendered by employees.

     26. Pension schemes (continued)                                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
     USS                                                                          
                                                                                  
     The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2018 (the
     valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method. A valuation as at 31 March 2020 is
     underway but not yet complete.                                               
                                                                                  
     Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder (defined benefit) assets
     and liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.
                                                                                  
     The 2018 valuation was the fifth valuation for the scheme under the scheme-specific funding regime
     introduced by the Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which
     is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions. At the valuation date, the
     value of the assets of the scheme was £63.7 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was
     £67.3 billion indicating a shortfall of £3.6 billion and a funding ratio of 95%.
                                                                                  
     The key financial assumptions used in the 2018 valuation are described below:
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      Pension increases (CPI) Term dependent rates in line with the difference between the
                            Fixed Interest and Index Linked yield curves, less 1.3% p.a.

                            Years 11-20: CPI + 2.52% reducing linearly to CPI + 1.55% by year 21
                            Years 21 +: CPI + 1.55%                               
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
     The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are
     based on analysis of the scheme’s experience carried out as part of the 2018 actuarial valuation. The
     mortality assumptions used in these figures are as follows:

     The 2020 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan. The provision figures have been produced using the

     The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The Scheme is a defined
     benefit scheme which is funded and valued every three years by the actuary using the projected unit
     method, the rates of contribution payable being determined by the trustees on the advice of the actuary. A
     full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2019 by a qualified independent actuary (Hymans
     Robertson LLP). The material assumptions and other data used by the actuary were:

     The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of actuarial assumptions
     which are acceptable under the requirements of FRS102.                       
     The FRS102 valuation has used RPI as the inflationary index to calculate scheme liabilities for current
                                                                                  
     members and used CPI in respect of deferred members.

     From 1 August 2013, the University has been required to automatically enrol its workers into a workplace
     pension scheme if they meet certain qualifying criteria, and are not members of any other scheme. Auto-
     enrolment does not replace the existing arrangements for contractual enrolment into AUPS/USS for regular
     employees. However auto-enrolment does apply to regular employees that have opted out of AUPS or
     USS, or who may opt out in the future, USS pensioners and casual workers. The University has chosen to
     offer NEST (the National Employment Savings Trust) as its workplace pension scheme for its casual

     30. Financial instruments                                                    
     Risk management                                                              
                                                                                  
     The University operates a centralised treasury management function which is responsible for managing the
     credit, liquidity, interest and foreign currency risk. These financial risks are managed within the parameters
     specified by the Finance Committee approved Treasury Management Policy. The treasury management
     policy adopts the key recommendations of the Code of Practice on Treasury Management in Public Service
     as issued by Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) as recommended by the
     Office for Students and is reviewed and updated annually.                    
                                                                                  
     The University’s principal financial instruments are cash, investments and loans. The core objective of
     these financial instruments is to meet the financing needs of the University’s operations. Additionally, the
     University has other financial assets and liabilities arising directly from its operations i.e. trade debtors and
     creditors.                                                                   
                                                                                  
     Credit risk                                                                  
     Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a
     financial loss to the University.                                            
                                                                                  
     The University’s credit risk arises from bank balances, investments, student debtors and commercial
     organisations as customers. Management of credit risk is a prime objective of the Treasury Management
     Policy. At 31 July 2020, the maximum exposure is represented by the carrying value of each financial
     asset in the balance sheet.                                                  
                                                                                  
     The credit risk of liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with
     investment grade credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The University’s exposure
     and the credit ratings of its counterparties are monitored regularly. The credit exposure is limited by
     counterparty limits and minimum counter party credit ratings set within the Treasury Management Policy.

     30. Financial instruments (continued)                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
     Student and commercial debtors are reviewed on an-ongoing basis and a bad debt provision is made if
     recovery becomes uncertain. If a debtor is deemed irrecoverable it is written off. The concentration of risk
                                                                                  
     is limited due to a large number of diverse customers across both students and commercial customer
     populations.                                                                 
     Liquidity risk                                                               
                                                                                  
     Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the University will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
     due. Regular monitoring of liquidity risk is an essential feature of treasury management activities.
                                                                                  
     Cash flow forecasts form part of the University’s 5 year strategic model and are revised during the financial
     year. The University policy is to maintain a minimum of £10m in on-call cash balances. Excess funds are
     invested to maximise the return whilst observing the Treasury Management Policy limits.
     Foreign currency risk                                                        
                                                                                  
     Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that unfavourable movement in exchange rates may cause financial
     loss to the University. The University’s principal foreign currency exposure is to the euro. On an annual
     basis after satisfying euro denominated liabilities the University is left with a surplus of Euros. Surplus
     euros are converted at spot rates or via forward contracts that are used to mitigate the risk of adverse
     exchange rate movements.                                                     
                                                                                  
     Interest rate risk                                                           
                                                                                  
     Interest rate risk refers to the likelihood that changes in interest rates will result in fluctuations of the value
     of balance sheet items (i.e. price risk) or changes in interest income or expenses (i.e. re-investments risk).
     Financial instruments – fair values                                          
                                                                                  
     The fair values of each category of the University’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying
     value in the balance sheet.

Notes to the Accounts (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
     For the year ended 31 July 2020                                              
                                                                                  
     31. Related party transactions                                               
                                                                                  
     The University’s Council members are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the
     University’s operations and the composition of the University Council (with members drawn from local,
     public and private sector organisations), it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in
     which a member of Council may have an interest.                              
                                                                                  
     All transactions involving organisations in which a member of Council may have an interest, including those
     identified below, are conducted at arm’s length and in accordance with the University’s Financial
     Regulations and normal procurement procedures.                               
     Related parties were identified by examining returns submitted by members of Council and senior
     management team members for the financial year 2019/20, as well as performing an online check via
     Creditsafe.                                                                  
                                                                                  
     These financial statements include the following transactions with related parties. No information has been
     listed for organisations where the income and expenditure is less than £1,000 in the financial year.
