Until 2011-12, this scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. In\n      2011-12 the University reviewed this policy, and decided to account for the scheme as a defined\n      benefit scheme.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n      Contributions to USS are charged to the income and expenditure account so as to spread the cost of\n      pensions over employees’ working lives with the University in such a way that the pension cost is a\n      substantially level percentage of present and future pensionable payroll. Variations from regular costs\n      are spread over the expected average remaining working lifetime of members of the schemes after\n      making allowances for further withdrawals.

The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the scheme expected to\n      arise from employee service in the period is charged to the operating surplus. The expected return on\n      the scheme’s assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the scheme’s\n      liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in pension finance costs.

The valuation was performed by Chartered Surveyors DTZ Debenham\n        Thorpe on the basis of depreciated replacement cost for the main campus together with open market\n        value for properties off-campus. The total valuation at the time amounted to £52.8 million and the\n        resulting £41.1 million excess over net book value was taken to the Revaluation Reserve.

USS provides benefits based on final pensionable salary for\n      academic and academic-related employees of all UK universities and other employees. AUPS provides\n      similarly calculated benefits for other staff of the University. Whilst all of these schemes are defined benefit\n      schemes, for the reasons explained below USS is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme. For\n      the other schemes FRS17 requires the deficit in the scheme to be reflected in the accounts and the movements\n      in the deficit to be reflected partly as a pension cost in the Income and Expenditure account and partly in the\n      Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses. The University also participated in the Local Government\n      Pension Scheme (LPGS) which was closed this year when the University’s last active member retired.\n                                                                                  \n      The total pension cost for the University was:                              \n                                                          2012-13   2011-12       \n                                                            £000      £000        \n      Contributions to USS                                  8,568    8,276        \n      Contributions to AUPS including FRS 17 adjustment     1,491    1,209        \n      Contributions to LGPS                                   78       27         \n      Release of Enhanced Pension Provision                  (21)       -         \n      Total Pension Cost                                   10,116    9,512        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      These amounts include contributions due but not paid at the year end as follows:\n                                                          2012-13   2011-12       \n                                                            £000      £000        \n      USS                                                      -        -         \n      AUPS                                                   117      120         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Summary of FRS 17 Liabilities                                               \n      Analysis of the amount shown in the balance sheet:                          \n                                                  AUPS      LGPS     Total        \n                                                                    2012-13       \n                                                   £000     £000      £000        \n      Total market value of assets                65,128       -     65,128       \n      Present value of scheme liabilities        (66,211)      -    (66,211)      \n      Deficit in the scheme - Net pension liability (1,083)    -    (1,083)       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                 Aston University Annual Report and Financial Statements 31 July 2013 49",

The assets of the scheme are\n        held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The institution is unable to identify its share of the underlying\n        assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17\n                                                                                  \n        “Retirement benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\n        As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure account represents the contributions payable to\n        the scheme in respect of the accounting period.                           \n                                                                                  \n        The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2011. This was the second valuation for\n        USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes\n        to adopt a stator funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical\n        provisions. The actuary also carries out regular reviews of the funding levels. In particular, he carries out a\n        review of the funding level each year between triennial valuations and details of his estimate of the funding level\n        at 31 March 2013 are also included in this note.                          \n        The triennial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. The assumptions which have the most\n        significant effect of the result of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments (ie the\n        valuation rate of interest), the rates of increase in salary and pensions and the assumed rates of morality. The\n                                                                                  \n        financial assumptions were derived from market yields prevailing at the valuation date. An “inflation risk\n        premium” adjustment was also included by deducting 0.3% from the market-implied inflation on account of the\n        determined rates or amounts, the shortfall at 31 March 2014 is estimated to be £2.2 billion, equivalent to a\n        funding level of 95%. The contribution rate will be reviewed as part of each valuation and may be reviewed more\n        frequently.                                                               \n        The technical provisions relate essentially to the past service liabilities and funding levels, but it is also\n        necessary to assess the ongoing cost of newly accruing benefits. The cost of future accrual was calculated\n        using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the technical provisions but the allowance for\n        promotional salary increases was not as high. Analysis has shown very variable levels of growth over and\n        above general pay increases in recent years, and the salary growth assumption built into the cost of future\n        accrual is based on more stable, historic, salary experience. However, when calculating the past service\n        liabilities of the scheme, a cautionary reserve has been included, in addition, on account of the variability\n        mentioned above.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n        As at the valuation date the Scheme was still a fully Final Salary Scheme for future accruals and the prevailing\n        employer contribution rate was 16% of Salaries.                           \n                                                                                  \n        Following UK government legislation, from 2011 statutory pension increases or revaluations are based on the\n        Consumer Prices Index measure of price inflation. Historically these increases had been based on the Retail\n        Prices Index measure of prices inflation.                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        50",

The\n        University had one active member in the LGPS who retired in 2012-13 whereupon the scheme was closed for\n        Aston University active members. Until 2011-12, this scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution\n        scheme. In 2011-12 the University reviewed this policy, and decided to account for the scheme as a defined\n        benefit scheme in accordance with FRS 17 based upon an actuarial valuation of the fund by the scheme’s\n        qualified independent actuary. For 2012-13, the accounting for LGPS was changed from FRS 17: Retirement\n        Benefits to FRS 12: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (note 18).\n                                                                                  \n        The following information relates to the University’s part of the scheme, not the entire scheme.\n                                                                                  \n        The assumptions used by the actuary are:                                  \n                                                   2012-13  2011-12   2010-11     \n        Salary scale increases per annum              n/a    3.75%     4.55%      \n        Pension increases per annum                   n/a     2.0%      2.8%      \n        Discount rate                                 n/a     3.8%      5.1%      \n        Price inflation                               n/a     2.0%      2.8%      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        54",
