In order to support this we\nhave already created a PGRS and supervisor support page which signposts PGRS and\nsupervisors to University and external support in this area. To further improve this\nwe have asked our counselling team to create some digital resources for our\nresearch supervisors and we have also asked them to contribute a session to our\ncompulsory supervisor training. These new resources and training will be developed\nduring 2023/2024 and rolled out in 2024/2025.\n4. Develop a new policy and training for the use of AI in research\nThe Graduate School will develop a new policy on the ethical use of AI in research.\nGuidance for both research staff and PGRS will be developed. We will also develop\ntraining around the ethical use of AI and its strengths and limitations.\n5. Develop a new policy and training for Trusted Research\nThe Graduate School and Research, Enterprise, Innovation and Support teams will\nwork together to develop and roll out a University Policy and training on Trusted\nResearch to ensure all researchers understand the principles of Trusted Research\nand their responsibilities as researchers.\n6. Develop and undertake an evaluation of our researcher development provision\nTo ensure our researcher development programme is meeting the needs of both our\nstaff and PGRS we will undertake an evaluation of the programme in 2023/2024 to\nidentify areas for improvement. Evaluation of individual sessions is not currently\nundertaken due to the size of the offering and limited staff capacity. The programme\nwill therefore be reviewed more holistically as part of a University wide evaluation\nof our Learning and Development offer. The planned evaluation will focus on\nwhether the research programme has improved knowledge and has been applied in\npractice as well as identifying barriers to engagement with researcher development."
