STRATEGIC REVIEW
Vice Chancellor’s Report
Operating environment – global pandemic and recovery plan
Birkbeck is a unique institution providing access to degree education for working Londoners
through the provision of teaching in the evening. As a consequence, most of our students are
mature and have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The fact that we are
different from the majority of higher education providers in the UK (who mostly teach young
undergraduates during the day) often means that Government policy and other external factors
have a different, and often unexpected, influence on Birkbeck. As an example, the advent of the
Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) policy and the 2012 undergraduate funding changes,
resulted in significant shifts in our student profile. As a specialist part-time study institution, we
were forced to quickly develop and introduce full-time evening programmes in 2010 as a risk
mitigating strategy against the policy changes which did not affect predominantly full-time
universities. Our part-time undergraduate population contracted by over 60% with full-time
evening degrees compensating for this decline. The College now has around 3,200 full time
equivalent (FTE) full-time undergraduates including those studying a foundation year (from
around zero in 2009) and 1,500 FTE part-time undergraduates (falling from 3,800 in 2011/12).
The coronavirus pandemic has hit all sectors of the UK economy in 2020 and changed the lives
of billions of people worldwide. In late March we moved all teaching materials on-line and swiftly
engaged with staff to ensure that they had the facilities to be able to work remotely. Although all
UK universities ultimately took the same course of action we were very mindful that many of our
students might be in groups at higher risk of contracting the virus, who were caring for vulnerable
family members or who were experiencing challenges with their employment. The safety of our
staff and students has been paramount as we implemented revised policies and ways of working.
Recognising that the Covid-19 outbreak was having an impact on everyone we were one of the
first UK universities to introduce a no detriment assessment policy for our students. Where
possible, assessments and examinations were moved on line and students were encouraged to
complete them. The policy ensures that students who attempted assessment and submitted on
time were not disadvantaged by completing assessment during the period of Covid-19 disruption
and they did not need to submit a mitigating circumstances claim. The widespread stress and
disruption is, therefore, automatically taken into account throughout the whole of our
assessment and examining process. For students unable to complete an assessment, or who
considered that their performance suffered as a direct result of significant personal or family
illness, bereavement or serious personal, emotional or financial challenges, either related or
unrelated to the outbreak of COVID-19, they could submit a mitigating circumstances claim for
sympathetic consideration by assessment boards.
Having quickly dealt with the immediate issues brought about by lockdown we developed a
Teaching Preparation Project (TPP) overseen by the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education) with support
from the Digital Education Team. It was clear to us that irrespective of how other universities
approached the Autumn term we would need to consider the unique make up of our student
body whilst being flexible enough to be able to quickly respond to changing government
guidelines. Our objective for 2020/21 is to ensure that all students are able to complete the
whole year of their studies remotely if they wish to or their circumstances require them to. Events
on campus, essential access to teaching laboratories for students and access to the library would
be made available when it was safe to do so.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The move to on-line teaching in the Spring was a reactive move mainly delivered via recorded
lectures. Over the summer, 500 academic colleagues transformed their modules to ensure that
they would be more immersive for students during 2020/21. Elements of self-study remain a
core part of the pedagogy for students at Birkbeck but remote study will be led by our research
active staff. Rather than face-to-face teaching on campus, in-person teaching on-line will be the
norm. The TPP will ensure that all students receive a quality of education that we are proud to
deliver, that is consistent across all modules and which should ensure that our students are
satisfied with the quality of their educational experience at Birkbeck.
Although the Library opened as a space for self-study at the start of the Autumn 2020 term
safety measures and remote study will limit access to our book stock for students. To mitigate
this, the Library has invested heavily in on-line e-books and digitisation to make sure that reading
lists and course materials are available on student devices and computers.
We have also recognised that many of our students will not have access to suitable work spaces
nor adequate digital hardware, software or skills. As well as opening up the self-study space in
the Library we have made available funds to support students with financial hardship to
purchase suitable IT equipment. To help transition new students to the world of on-line study and
to maintain the services that current students need, a number of support mechanisms have
been developed and quickly introduced this year including:
• A 3-day on-line Careers Summer Boot Camp was attended by 300 students. In
previous face-to-face versions of these type of activities we would attract a few
dozen students to campus at most. Students save travel time and money
undertaking student support sessions at a time and place of their convenience;
• Careers & Employability services traditionally have a 30% attendance rate (from
sign up) to their events but over the summer this attendance figure is more like 60-
70%. Our reach via the on-line careers platform and a new bitesize podcast series
has increased during lockdown;
• The Studiosity on-line writing and feedback pilot was extended to cover all taught
students in 2019/20 and has retained over 90% student approval ratings with
users. The service provides students with regular constructive comments on the
style and content of their writing thereby helping them improve consistently during
the year rather than having to await formal assessment feedback;
• On-line study skills workshops have attracted 1,558 students so far this summer
with nine more sessions to go (at the time of writing). 80% of students gave the
classes feedback scores of 4 out of 5 or above;
• Orientation will be fully online this year and comprehensively covers the whole of
the student journey. It has been designed to be applicable to welcome new
students and re-orientate continuing ones. At the time of writing the number of
students working through the 4-5 hours of content is growing daily and forecast to
far exceed the student numbers attending the traditional Saturday Orientation Day
before term starts.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The comprehensive programme of activities we have developed will ensure increasing numbers
of students are study ready for the start of term which will then support retention and outcomes
for students during a particularly challenging time. Although these interventions were developed
to facilitate the move to on-line learning the rates of take-up may confirm that our busy
commuter students are looking for on-demand services that wrap around work, caring and study
time. Students at Birkbeck have consistently welcomed the learning opportunities that face-to-
face interactions with tutors and other students bring and we will retain that, but we will also be
analysing whether the move to in-person on-line study provides our unique type of student with
additional flexibility that may be welcomed by them for the long term.
Birkbeck was very successful in the 2014 Research Assessment Exercise (REF) submitting 83%
of eligible staff with approximately three-quarters of their research being rated either ‘world
leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). Although the pandemic has had a significant
impact on colleagues’ ability to undertake much of their planned research we believe that all of
our eligible staff have acquired the necessary outputs to be submitted to the next REF in 2021
where we are aiming for at least the same level of success as in 2014.
The pandemic has restricted movement within the UK and abroad and many of our portfolio of
research projects have been placed on hold with funding bodies agreeing to no cost extensions.
This has reduced the external research income recorded in our financial statements this year
although the contribution to overheads is broadly similar to last year. With the majority of our
research active staff concentrating on converting their teaching modules as part of the TPP
research is recommencing gradually: we ensured that we re-opened our research laboratories as
soon as it was safe to do so in a Covid-19 safe way; in September staff could access their offices
once again (albeit in a way that followed our safety guidelines); and, although international travel
is still heavily restricted at the start of term, other activities such as participant testing is taking
place once again. We have also increased the size of our internal Research Innovation Fund as a
way to support early career researchers. Academic colleagues will be able to access the fund for
a range of needs, including the costs of childcare, to assist with their research during a potential
second wave of coronavirus infections.
The immediate financial consequences of the pandemic and the possible impact on student
recruitment in 2020/21 and beyond, will be discussed in the Financial Review alongside an
assessment of the financial sustainability of the College. It is, however, worth reflecting on the
fact that the pandemic also interrupted the second year of the College recovery plan.
Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since
2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off
equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of
£5.0 million in 2018/19. The main cause of this was a significant fall in EU students in 2017/18,
the first full recruitment cycle after the EU referendum on 23 June 2016. In 2017/18, we
recruited nearly 400 fewer EU students than in 2016/17. Although many UK universities
experienced a reduction in applicant numbers that year, the effect on Birkbeck was more
marked. A high proportion of our students from the EU already live and work in London and it was
from this group that we saw the highest fall in enrolments. We believe that this was a direct
result of Brexit related uncertainty over employment and residency.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The trend continued into 2018/19 with enrolments of EU nationals falling a further 200 – a
cumulative drop of 30.3% between 2015/16 (pre-Brexit) and 2018/19. In financial terms this
equated to a reduction in income of £4.0 million. New enrolments for 2019/20 saw a year-on-
year increase of 128 student FTEs (21% year-on-year) and based on application and offer
numbers another rise is expected in 2020/21. This is likely to be a “dead cat bounce” effect as
students from the EU rush to start their programmes before the UK Government removes their
right to loan funding. 2020/21 will be the final year that EU students will receive financial
support for their studies and we fully expect numbers to fall drastically from 2021 onwards.
Although a fall in numbers is likely, it is possible that charging EU students higher fees may
compensate financially although this is a risky assumption. A range of post-Brexit scenarios are
being considered as part of our financial planning.
The Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) has come under pressure financially over the
last few years as mortality rates increased and market returns fell. The Pensions Act 2004
requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective which aims to have sufficient and
appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. The triennial scheme valuation in 2017 and
the additional valuation in 2018 had the effect of raising employer contributions to the scheme
by 3.1% of payroll to 21.1% with another rise of 2.6% scheduled to come in October 2021.
Member contributions will have risen by 3% to 11.0% in the same period if the October 2021
increase is introduced. Across the sector it is now estimated that between 18 and 20% of eligible
staff opt out of the pension scheme, largely on affordability grounds.
A Joint Expert Panel (JEP) was created with equal membership from the University and College
Union (UCU) representing members and Universities UK (UUK) representing employers. The JEP
made a number of recommendations aimed at re-building trust in the scheme valuation process
as well as considering ways to ensure that the scheme was affordable, sustainable and inter-
generationally fair. The 2020 triennial valuation (which unfortunately values the scheme at the
low point of the pandemic economic downturn at the end of March 2020) will hopefully include
some of the JEP recommendations. A consultation on the technical provisions which underpin the
2020 valuation has just been commenced by USS. It is quite likely that the latest USS valuation
will place further pressure on the College finances and this risk has been included in our long
term financial forecasts.
The impact on the financial position of the College following lower student income as a result of
Brexit and higher staff costs, in part from the increasing contributions to USS, can be
demonstrated in Chart 1.

Chart 1: Staff costs and tuition income 2015/16 to 2019/20
Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases and increment
advancement) exceeds the inflationary increase in in our main source of income (primarily due to
the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees). As a consequence, not only
have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but without significant remedial
action these deficits will grow as the gap between staff costs and tuition income widens. We are
also mindful that student recruitment in an increasingly competitive environment post-Brexit is
challenging and that developing plans based on student number growth alone will be risky.
Our institutional strategy commits us to a series of investments designed to improve the quality
of our core teaching and research activities and to modernise our material and organisational
infrastructure. Cumulatively, the goal is to ensure that we keep true to our unique mission and
look and perform at a level in keeping with our reputation for excellence.
Crucial strands of this strategy are:
• Student Experience Review implementation, ensuring that our diverse student body is
properly supported to succeed resulting in strong National Student Survey (NSS) and
Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF) outcomes;
• Estates strategy for expansion and modernisation of the estate, addressing long-
standing issues about teaching space and delivering appropriate research facilities;
• Improved research support infrastructure to cement our place in the top tranche of
research-intensive institutions at the REF.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2020
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
None of our three key institutional goals are self-funding. All require upfront investment and the
primary gains are in terms of depth and quality and improving the experience of students and
staff on to a par with the comparator institutions against which we benchmark ourselves. Whilst
in the long term there will be financial gains -directly through improved retention and research
funding and indirectly as a result of reputational impact – these will not be at a level that in and
of itself sustains a higher equilibrium.
When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with
turnover of £100 to £250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we
are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost
pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and
student body adds major complexity and inflexibility to our underlying business model. Provision
at the heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue
other activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity into 15 hours
a week in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be
addressed.
More fundamentally, in addition to tuition fee and income, our benchmark competitors currently
have significant additional income streams, primarily through campus/facility related income and
through knowledge transfer/spin off/commercialisation activities. As we have neither residences
nor a science park/innovation hub, we lack these income streams.
These comparisons do indicate that in order to function effectively we need to generate
additional income streams of our own. Whilst growth based on our existing portfolio is an
important part of any recovery plan we also need to spread risk by investing in growth across a
range of initiatives.
To do so, we have looked to our unique mission and unrivalled location and attempted to turn
them to our advantage rather than see them solely as drivers of increased cost and complexity.
As an institution embedded in the social fabric of a metropolis we are seeking to generate
additional activity and income streams aligned with the needs of London’s culture, economy and
society.
In tandem with developing additional income streams and increasing student numbers we must
also closely manage our staff cost base. We are committed to maintaining promotion and
recruitment processes which develop and reward talent. We are also making interventions in
relation to our equalities and diversity strategy and looking to integrate and support teaching and
scholarship staff who are currently on sessional contracts (some on an open-ended basis as part
of an ongoing role, others in response to specific and non-recurrent needs). In this context the
adoption of an expectations and workload framework for academic staff, alongside
appraisal/review, is a significant development which enables us to ensure that we are using our
resources effectively.
The issues of complexity, and the incremental layering of new activities onto pre-existing
structures as the College has sought to rapidly adapt, identified in relation to teaching, is also
true for the College’s professional and support services and School-based administrations. Whilst
elements of this have been and are being tackled with focused reviews of specific processes, the
current situation requires a more holistic externally supported review that focuses additionally on
organisation, capacity, capability and resource that will inform service planning and delivery in
this new climate. Cumulatively both the development trajectory we are proposing, and these
initiatives, do constitute a significant level of organisational change.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2020
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
In order to deliver the strategic objectives whilst returning to a sustainable financial position we
agreed a recovery plan in 2018/19 which aimed to focus on the following core building blocks:
• Rebase staff costs so that the College can return a break-even budget (before
exceptional items) with 9,000 students (FTE);
• Reduce non-staff budgets by £2.0 million from a 2017/18 base and maintain levels at
the same cash position year-on-year;
• Deliver recovery plan projects.
Our underlying budget (before restructuring and unusual costs) for 2019/20 was set at a deficit
of £3.0 million and moved us from an underlying deficit before exceptional items of £5.0 million
in 2018/19. The recovery plan assumed a break-even budget for 2020/21, with increasing
surpluses thereafter.
The coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of 2020 impacted on our recovery plan in a number of
ways but we have been clear throughout that both the rationale and strategy underpinning
recovery remained valid. Although we would inevitably have to adapt our plans in the short, and
possibly medium, term it was critical that we did not simply say that the required actions were on
hold. As indicated by Chart 1, any delay in rebasing staff costs would simply widen the gap
between costs and income and make resolution more complicated.
To facilitate financial planning conversations internally, we had already separated core business
income and expenditure from unusual income and costs such as changes to pension liabilities,
restructuring costs, new endowments etc. Although these items are all important, they can be
quite volatile from year to year thereby masking the financial performance of the core business.
We successfully launched a voluntary severance and early retirement scheme in the autumn of
2018 and achieved recurrent savings of around £3.0 million in staff costs. A review of the
efficiency and effectiveness of administration was scheduled to commence in 2020 backed by
benchmark data from the Uniforum methodology (a process used by many Russell Group
universities in recent years) although developing action plans to reduce costs has been delayed
until the start of 2021 due to the pandemic.
During 2019/20 we had also planned to continue to work with departments with low staff
student ratios (SSR) and non-sustainable financial contributions with a view to addressing
inefficiencies in costs whilst identifying opportunities to grow income. Similarly, market research
had identified departments which could be reshaped to take advantage of the ever-changing
needs of employers and students. Although many of the planned interventions could not be
progressed as we wished due to the re-focus on responding to the pandemic and the challenges
associated with remote working, we have still made progress towards the objectives laid out in
our recovery plan.
In particular, with support from the College trade unions, a redeployment scheme was agreed to
limit the risk of redundancies. Not all optional modules were converted to on-line mode so some
staff, particularly those on hourly paid contracts, had their teaching loads reduced. These staff
have been put into a redeployment pool and offered the opportunity to apply for any vacancies
that arose across the College. This process of restricting replacements whilst also trying to
protect jobs is nevertheless delivering financial savings.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
By continuing to focus on recovery whilst also dealing with the exceptional circumstances of the
pandemic it was pleasing to note that we delivered an outturn before exceptional items which
was significantly better than budget. Even if estimates are made to reflect the direct financial
impact of Covid-19, we still delivered a small surplus compared with a budget deficit of £3.0
million. The financial position, along with the potential impact of the virus on future years, is
discussed in detail in the Financial Review section of this report.
Although financial recovery will be challenging we are different to most multi-faculty, daytime-
teaching, predominantly undergraduate universities. Having demonstrated our teaching quality
by achieving a silver award in the Teaching Excellence Framework and our research quality from
a highly successful Research Excellence Framework assessment, this coupled with our unique
mode of delivery gives us strong encouragement that we will successfully achieve our ambitious
plans.
We were pleased to see a recognition in the Augar report that falling part-time student numbers
needed to be reversed. We have lobbied long and hard since 2012 and believe that a lifelong
funding scheme that supports mature learners to upskill, change career or indeed to enter higher
education for the first time is essential. At the beginning of October 2020 we welcomed the
Government’s announcement that it is to create a new four-year lifelong learning allowance and
to provide loans for students to cover the fees of studying on short courses. Whilst we are still
waiting for the details of these new initiatives to be published, they are promising moves that
reflect changes which we have been pressing the Government to introduce. On the back of this
government proposal we will once more reinforce the need to abolish the rule that prevents
someone from doing a higher education qualification that is at the same level or lower than those
that they already have (ELQ).
Awards
Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards and honours
received during the year.
Birkbeck Professor of Mathematics PProfessor Sarah Hart will take up the position of Professor of
Geometry at Gresham College in 2020/21, a position thought to be the oldest mathematics
professorship in the UK. This follows Professor Joanna Bourke’s appointment as Professor of
Rhetoric at the college last year. By gaining the role, Professor Hart joins a number of major
figures in mathematics who have been appointed Gresham Geometry Professors in the past,
including Henry Briggs, Robert Hooke, Karl Pearson, Sir Roger Penrose, and John D Barrow.
Professor Hart is an active researcher, publishing mainly in the area of pure mathematics known
as group theory, which has many applications both inside and outside of mathematics, for
example in coding theory and cryptography. Professor Hart is also Vice-President of the British
Society for the History of Mathematics and a keen mathematics communicator, speaking to a
wide variety of audiences at numerous public lectures and talks in schools on topics such as
mathematics and art.

Dr Dionyssis Dimitrakopoulos, Senior Lecturer in Politics and Programme Director of the MSc
European Politics and Policy, has been awarded a Jean Monnet Chair in Parliamentary
Democracy and European Integration. The corresponding funding will cover teaching and
research activities in the field of European integration over the next three academic years. Dr
Dimitrakopoulos is an active researcher, with research interests in the politics of European
integration at the European as well as the domestic levels. He is currently researching the EU’s
reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Jean Monnet Chairs are awarded through a highly competitive process by the European
Commission through the European Union’s Erasmus+ programme. The position is awarded based
on promoting excellence in teaching and research on EU studies, fostering debate around
European issues, encouraging active citizenship, and disseminating knowledge to the wider
public, in a critical and objective manner. The Chairs are named after French diplomat Jean
Monnet (1888-1979), a key figure in the founding of the European Union.
Professor Bonnie Wallace, Professor of Molecular Biophysics, has been named the winner of the
Royal Society of Chemistry’s Khorana Prize. Professor Wallace won the award for the pioneering
development of biophysical methods and bioinformatics tools to enable the characterisation of
ion channel-drug molecule complexes. Professor Wallace’s lab was the first to determine the
three-dimensional (crystal) structure of an open, active, full-length sodium channel, and to
identify the locations of the three sodium ions within the channel selectivity filter, and the
features that define their unique specificity for sodium versus other types of ions. This
information is helping guide the development of new pharmaceutical drugs.
The OOpen Library of Humanities project (OLH) was recognised as a ‘force of nature’ in the Open
Publishing Awards, with the judges noting that their open access economic model is
‘comprehensive and inspiring.’ The Open Publishing Awards were set up by the Coko Foundation,
an organisation that facilitates the scholarly communications sector to take control of their
infrastructure.
The OLH is an online publishing platform founded by Dr Caroline Edwards and Professor Martin
Eve from the Department of English, Theatre and Creative Writing. It was created to address the
issue of high subscription costs for academic journals and the ‘serials crises’ in the sector, as
library budgets struggle to keep up with the prices set by the publishers. The platform recognises
that humanities subjects are not afforded the same level of funding as STEM subjects and seeks
to redress this disadvantage by getting funding through a model of Library Partnership Subsidies,
instead of Article Processing Charges, to fund a number of journals and its own multidisciplinary
journal. Since its conception, the platform has gained a number of supporters throughout the
world, ensuring its success as a sustainable platform.
Professor Sir Roger Penrose OM was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work carried out
at Birkbeck in the 1960s that demonstrated that black holes were an inevitable consequence of
Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. The award is shared with Professors Rheinhard Genzel
and Andrea Ghez for their experimental discovery of a supermassive black hole at the centre of
the Milky Way.
Penrose was appointed Reader of Applied Mathematics at Birkbeck in 1964 and made Professor
two years later. In between these events, in 1965, he published a seminal mathematical proof
that a singularity in space-time will occur in a gravitational collapse of a massive star. It is for this
work that he has been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Dr Mark Williams, Director of the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology's Biophysics Centre
at Birkbeck reflected that: "It’s always an honour as a present member of staff to reflect on the
long and continuing tradition of outstanding science here at Birkbeck. This is the fourth Birkbeck

scientist to receive the Nobel Prize and I believe the first where all the work for the Prize was
done here at Birkbeck. Penrose tells the story that he was crossing the road walking into
Birkbeck, talking to a colleague, when he suddenly had an inspiration of how to solve the
gravitational collapse problem. He was then able to write his Nobel prize winning article in just a
few months. We can all hope for such inspirations!"
Birkbeck’s first female professor, DDame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan has been commemorated with a
blue plaque at Flat 93, Bedford Court Mansions in Bloomsbury – her London home near the
College for almost 50 years. Professor Gwynne-Vaughan was a prominent English botanist and is
recognised for her significant contributions to military and public service. After becoming Head of
the Botany Department at Birkbeck in 1909 she gained her professorship in 1921. Across the
capital, over 900 plaques on buildings- humble and grand- honour the notable men and women
who have lived or worked in them. Only 14 per cent of London’s blue plaques celebrate women, a
matter which English Heritage is seeking to address.
Estates
The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary space,
to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to improve research
facilities. Governors approved an Estates Strategy which determined that a number of projects
were required to improve the quality of our research and teaching space and also to increase the
amount of teaching space that was under the direct, or shared, control of the College.
A governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards
(membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design teams,
senior College staff and independent Governors) which feed in to the Strategic Estates &
Infrastructure Committee (a sub-committee of Governors). The structure aims to ensure that all
aspects of each project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is
obtained, the building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on
major projects are also provided to each meeting of the Finance & General Purposes and Audit
committees to provide assurance that all risks are being appropriately managed.
For the past twenty years, the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development’s (CBCD) BabyLab has
been investigating the psychological processes in infants’ brains and they have uncovered major
insights into child development. The BabyLab scientists have identified the earliest marker of
autism in babies, examined the links between Down’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease and
investigated the effects of screen time on babies as young as six-months-old. A purpose built
ToddlerLab to extend the research of CBCD to older children is scheduled to open in late 2020.
The ToddlerLab will be equipped with sophisticated wireless technology which allows toddlers to
carry out normal activities while tracking their brain activity and monitoring their behaviour. An
example of the cutting-edge technology is a virtual environment known as the “CAVE” which
simulates real-world surroundings, such as a farm or a supermarket, and monitors how toddlers’
brain activity changes depending on the world around them.
In April 2018 the College received planning permission from the London Borough of Camden to
renovate and extend a 1920’s building, called Cambridge House, on Euston Road. London-based
architect, Penoyre & Prasad, added a copper-clad two-storey lecture theatre to the top of the
existing structure to create a flexible and high quality teaching space. The plans also include a
café and active learning space on the ground floor and basement and teaching classrooms on
the upper floors. The building will add around 440 square metres of additional teaching space to
the College building portfolio providing capacity for over 600 students and staff. Construction
commenced in 2019 with the building due to open in early 2021.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
In the last couple of years significant structural works to some of our Georgian buildings have
been identified. Design works were commenced in 2019 to repair and improve the terrace in
Gordon Square to ensure that it provided suitable space for staff and students for the
foreseeable future. Although Governors have allocated budget to conclude the current phase of
design it is likely that the impact of the global pandemic on our cash flow will result in a delay to
the construction phase. The position will be reviewed in the Spring of 2021 when the cash
position is better understood. We will also need to consider whether building projects identified
pre-pandemic still provide the most effective solutions to support our post-pandemic strategy.
Short term interventions to ensure that Gordon Square remains safe to occupy may need to be
developed.
In addition, we need to continue to invest in long term maintenance, infrastructure and capital
equipment. Improvements were made during the summer of 2020 to the College IT system to
facilitate the move to remote working and teaching. Aspects of network security were also
improved to reduce the increased external risks likely from remote working. Critical projects to
replace the roof, windows and heating at our main building in Malet Street are also being
prioritised over the next 24 months.
With many competing priorities and a financial plan that is based on consolidation and recovery,
the College is carefully considering its position. The key objectives outlined in the original Estates
Strategy remain valid, and Governors are keen to invest in the estate where it benefits teaching
and research. However, the timing and scale of estates projects will continue to be measured
against affordability criteria by the Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committee.
Gender pay gap
Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to
operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which
rewards staff in line with the College commitment to equality and diversity. The Gender Pay Gap
report is produced each year as part of our ongoing commitment to monitor gender equality and
diversity pay issues in our workforce. We have been publishing equal pay audits since 2009 and
continue this practice in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific
Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on certain metrics
annually. Despite the UK Government suspending formal reporting in March 2020 due to the
pandemic we still completed our report on this important matter.
In addition to the mandatory annual Gender Pay Gap report, Birkbeck also undertakes a full pay
audit periodically (most recent 2018) to provide analysis and recommendations in relation to
reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the institution. This
report considers the pay of staff with other protected characteristics.
The gender pay data published in March 2020 for hourly pay and bonus pay is summarised in
Tables 1 and 2:
Mean hourly pay Median hourly pay Total employees
Femaale ((£) Male (£) Female (£) Male (£) Female Male
23.44 25.63 21.33 23.74 1,013 879

Birkbeck first reported gender pay in 2003 when the mean gender pay gap was 16.9%. This has
halved to its current level through a combination of policy intervention and raising awareness.
The Universities & Colleges Employers Association compiled and published the 2018 gender pay
data for the sector in June 2019. Using this benchmark we were ranked 18th of 131 employers
for most equitable mean gender pay gap and 41st of 131 employers for most equitable median
gender pay gap. We remain committed to further progress on equal pay and have set out both an
action plan and monitoring targets.

Table 2: Gender pay gap – bonus pay
Birkbeck makes a relatively low number of bonus payments in comparison to the wider sector -
the sector average is 8.4% of staff receiving a bonus payment, at Birkbeck it is 2.4%. We operate
a number of contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different conditions
required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to demonstrate
excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal circumstances and all
committee members undertake both formal equality & diversity and unconscious bias training.
Reward scheme data is annually reviewed by the College for equality & diversity issues in
application and success rates.
The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal
pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the
population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted
actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena
Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the
academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application
and promotion rate of women to more senior academic roles. Work continues on this issue.
The College Equal Pay Audit 2018 examines gender but also includes analyses of pay gaps by
ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. The full report, which includes actions and benchmark
data, can be found at http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/equality/equal-pay-audit
Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2019
to 31 March 2020
The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility Time is the
provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.

Chart 3: Summary of activities to be supported by donations
In addition to supporting the College financially, every year our alumni and friends play an
important role in aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives. Last year 515
students benefitted from the support, guidance and advice given by our 324 volunteers who gave
a total of 5,050 hours of time (a 36% increase from 2018/19).
Whilst the pandemic has caused adverse circumstances and uncertainty for so many of our
students, staff, alumni and donors, it has shown the real and pressing need for flexible support.
We are confident that our community will continue to come together to provide vital funding and
expertise to ensure that Birkbeck students and researchers continue to have access to the tools,
support and services that enable them to thrive.
As we move towards our 200th anniversary in 2023, our alumni and supporters will be vital in
helping us to achieve our ambitious strategic priorities. Over the coming year we will broaden our
fundraising activity, deepen our relationships with current supporters and attract new donors to
support these ambitions.
As the new academic year begins I am pleased to reflect on the remarkable ways in which the
College community has worked together to support each other to address and overcome the
unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that Covid-19 has presented over the past six
months. There will undoubtedly continue to be many more challenges ahead. It would be
remarkable if everything were to run smoothly without any hiccups this term but by continuing to
work together, I am sure that we will be able to overcome them. After months of hard work by
staff across the College, we should all be extremely proud of the largely virtual university that we
have launched. The high-quality online platform that we have developed, backed up with in-
person sessions where they are required, such as for laboratory practical sessions,
complemented by bookable campus facilities, will allow our students to continue to benefit safely
from the full Birkbeck learning experience during the pandemic.
Birkbeck, like other Universities up and down the country, has been through a tumultuous period
in the unprecedented situation caused by the pandemic. It is testimony to the collective effort of
all our staff that we are emerging in a much better position than many other Universities, having
Page 23

managed to respond with agility and at pace to a wide range of challenges, in a manner that has
allowed us to grow student numbers whilst controlling costs. It must be recognised that this
would not have been possible without the commitment to Birkbeck and its unique mission which
is shared right through the staff community. Academic and professional staff have had to work in
new ways as in an emergency we have shifted to largely remote working and online teaching
delivery, and the levels of flexibility that we have shown in adjusting workloads and workstreams
to cope with new needs has not been easy, Nevertheless, it has been vital in our reaching the
position that we are ending 2021 in. There clearly are challenges ahead as we progress through
the next stages of the pandemic and emerge into a new demographic and economic context
shaped by Brexit and Covid-19 impacts on London. However, in our emergency response we have
learned about the potential of operating in different ways and now is the moment for us to be
bold, to think through which aspects of our pandemic response could bring lasting benefits in
embedding flexibility for students and staff and to develop a new Birkbeck model that meets the
future needs of our city and country.
A number of lay governors as well as staff and student members of our governing body stood
down this year after reaching the end of their terms. They have all given freely of their time,
experience and energy and have shown real support and commitment to the College and the
unique services it provides. I thank each and every one of them for their roles in moving the
College forward. Replacement lay governors have been identified with the assistance of an
independent search consultant and will join incoming staff and student representatives chosen
by relevant standing orders. We look forward to welcoming them all in the autumn.
Following a range of discussions across the College it has been agreed that the historic title of
Master of Birkbeck will be changed with immediate effect to Vice-Chancellor. All colleagues
agreed that Vice-Chancellor more appropriately reflected the role being undertaken by the head
of institution at a university in the 21st Century. Birkbeck is a member of the University of London
and the role of Vice-Chancellor has previously been reserved to the head of the university and
was not available to the member colleges. Draft legislation has been prepared to allow
constituent colleges to also use the Vice-Chancellor title if they wished but passage through
Parliament has been delayed due to the virus. We are grateful to the current Vice-Chancellor for
agreeing to the use of the title whilst we await the formal approval.
In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
Birkbeck set out his vision: ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of
knowledge’ This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have
made between, work, study, culture, research and society. As we move into a post-pandemic,
post-Brexit world and approach our third century we will continue to offer transforming
educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial, practical or
otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will shortly commence cross-College
discussions to update our strategy for the next five years to both build on the remarkable on-line
developments of the summer and to ensure that we are positioned to meet the needs of our
future students. We will work closely with employers and government to assist with the up-skilling
and re-skilling of individuals which will be vital to the recovery of the regional and national
economy. Within an increasingly volatile operating environment, we will maintain and develop our
distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and
better space and facilities for all of our activities.

Financial Review
The Financial Statements presented to the Governors comprise the consolidated results of the
College and its subsidiary. The principal activities undertaken by the Group are teaching and
research together with ancillary activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include
rendering academic services to a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of
Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,
has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are
prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed
assets and derivative financial instruments).
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on families, businesses and economies
across the world. Education has been curtailed during the period of lockdown and examinations
have been severely disrupted. This has led to direct and indirect financial consequences for UK
universities including Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.
At the beginning of the year we acknowledged that the virus would create disruption and
uncertainty so adapted both the management accounts for the year and the future forecasts.
Having returned an underlying deficit (before pension and other adjustments) in 2018/19 the
College had developed a plan to return to surpluses within three years. Although focus would
need to be shifted to dealing with the immediate issues thrown up by the pandemic it was also
important to maintain progress towards recovery. Estimates for the direct financial impact of the
pandemic during both 2019/20 and 2020/21 were separated from the underlying “business as
usual” position to facilitate discussion and decision making. This Financial Review will comment
on the business as usual position and the financial impact of the pandemic. Comment will also
be provided on pension and other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of
Comprehensive Income and capital expenditure.

Chart 5: Analysis of income 2019/20
The recurrent teaching grant from the government has been falling steadily since undergraduate
tuition fees were increased in 2012 and fell by a further £0.7 million in 2019/20 (a reduction of
13.0% year-on-year). Teaching grant now represents only 4.3% of College income in comparison
with 47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in
2005/06 to 65.5% in 2019/20 (up by £3.8 million on 2018/19).
Recurrent grant from Research England rose by £0.7 million in 2019/20, an increase of 7.3%. In
part this related to an additional £138,000 for research support and a one-off additional
payment of £274,000. External research activity was affected by the lockdown during the latter
part of 2019/20 and a number of projects needed to be suspended. Zero cost extensions have
been agreed with most funders in recognition of the enforced delay in delivering outputs. As a
consequence, we were unable to recognise income from research grants and contracts to the
same extent as in previous years with a fall of £0.4 million compared with 2018/19.
Whilst the majority of academic and professional support staff across the College were able to
work from home successfully a small number of research, nursery, cleaning and facilities staff
could not. These staff were furloughed but continued to receive full salary. In line with the
guidelines for universities £350,000 was claimed from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme as
a contribution towards the salaries of the furloughed staff. This is included in Other Income.
As an evening provider of higher education Birkbeck rents much of its space to other universities
during the daytime and rents space from them in the evening to support the teaching of its own
students. With lockdown preventing any activity on campus in the summer term a net loss of
rental income of around £0.3 million resulted. Catering income was also impacted falling £0.7
million below our budget expectations.

Chart 6: Main levels of study enrolment trends 2011/12 to 2019/20
The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since 2011/12 appears to have
plateaued. After much lobbying by the College since the undergraduate fee was increased in
2012, we welcomed the Government’s announcement in October 2020 that it is to create a new
four-year lifelong learning allowance and to provide loans for students to cover the fees of
studying on short courses. Whilst we are still waiting for the details of these new initiatives to be
published, they are promising moves that reflect changes which we have been pressing the
Government to introduce. On the back of this proposal we will once more reinforce the need to
abolish the rule that prevents someone from studying a higher education qualification that is at
the same level or lower than those that they already have (ELQ). Re-skilling and up-skilling of the
UK workforce will be critical for post-pandemic, post-Brexit economic recovery.
Our strategy to introduce full-time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be
seen in Chart 6. We continue to recruit well in a competitive undergraduate market in London
despite enrolments being affected by a reduction in EU nationals. Chart 7 starkly demonstrates
the significant impact the Brexit referendum in June 2016 had on recruitment of EU nationals
with numbers falling by 18.4% in 2017/18 (the first full recruitment cycle after the referendum)
and a further 12.2% in 2018/19.
More recently, we enhanced our access routes to higher education for students without
traditional qualifications by introducing a degree with foundation year route. Recruitment has
increased dramatically each year giving students an opportunity to commence a university
programme which might otherwise have been denied to them.

Year-on-year change in student numbers by
domicile post-referendum
In 2016/17, postgraduate recruitment showed a marked increase (Chart 6) due to the
introduction of the postgraduate loan. Full-time numbers then fell slightly in 2017/18, partly due
to the fall in EU students but also due to increased competition as more institutions advertised
the new student loan which had originally been announced close to the start of the 2016/17
academic year. Recruitment has increased steadily since then with postgraduate masters
students representing 28.9% of total enrolments. Postgraduate enrolments in 2019/20
represent an increase of 30.6% over 2015/16 which was the final year pre-loans.
Income from full-time Home and EU students increased by £2.2 million arresting the declines of
previous years due to the reduction in EU student numbers. Income from international students
rose by £0.9 million (an increase of 10.8%) and now represents 8.5% of total income (2018/19:
7.9% of total income). International student income has steadily grown over the last five years as
we have placed more emphasis on international brand management and awareness. We believe
that there is scope for further increases, particularly with the re-introduction of the post-study
work visa. Income from full time international students has now increased 37.1% in five years.
Income from part-time students rose by £0.7 million – the second year-on-year increase since the
dramatic fall in numbers from 2012. It is hoped that developing Government policy with the
extension of student loans to short courses will provide the part-time market with overdue
reinvigoration.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The analysis of expenditure confirms that the College continues to invest heavily in education
and research with only 17.5% of total expenditure (2018/19: 18.2%) spent on administration
and other professional services.
In 2020 we insourced cleaning and night security staff to recognise their long-standing
commitment to the College. The staff now have access to the SAUL pension scheme alongside
other benefits associated with being a member of staff at the College. The part year effect of this
was to reduce other operating expenditure by £0.5 million with a corresponding increase in staff
costs. A review of whether the College can also insource catering staff will continue in 2021.
Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and
restructuring costs) has been rising consistently over a number of years and has become
unsustainable. A Voluntary Severance and Early Retirement scheme was introduced in 2018/19
and contributed to the reduction as a percentage of total income in 2019/20 (see Table 3). The
College does not own any student residences (which increase income without a corresponding
increase in staff costs) so this percentage is one of the highest in the sector.

BBirkbeck, University of London
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2020
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Tuition fees and education contracts provided 66.6% of total income in 2019/20 (2018/19:
65.1%) whilst staff costs represent 68.0% of total income. With undergraduate fees fixed by the
UK government there is a mismatch between the inflationary increase in income and the
additional staff costs. Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking
the rise in staff costs. A post-Brexit fall in students enrolling from the EU coupled with increasing
pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 10 and directly led to the underlying
deficit in 2018/19. In 2019/20, lower staff costs following the VSER scheme coupled with
increased student income brought the two lines closer together. We still have some way to go to
return a financially sustainable position which delivers underlying surpluses of 5% of income.
The coronavirus pandemic closed our campus in April 2020 and required us to quickly move
activity on-line for both staff and students. Inevitably, additional costs were incurred as we moved
to change the way we worked and delivered education. At the same time, income was affected
through the closure of buildings but costs were also saved from a number of sources. It is difficult
to ascertain exactly what the financial impact in 2019/20 has been but a comparison of
performance from April 2020 against the phased budget can provide some indicators. Table 4
summarises the main headings.

Table 4: Estimate of financial impact of coronavirus pandemic in 2019/20
In addition to the net saving estimated above the pandemic impacted upon the way we were able
to proceed with our recovery plan. With remote working affecting our ability to work with certain
academic departments to improve their financial position in the way that we had planned, we
needed to revise our approach. In large part progress towards further staff cost savings was
achieved not through an additional cost reduction scheme but through a freeze on new and
replacement posts coupled with a redeployment scheme agreed with our trade union
representatives. This had the effect of increasing staff savings during the year by £0.4 million.
Due to the restrictions on travel imposed this year and to recognise the hard work put in by staff
to cope with the move to remote working and teaching, our annual leave rules were adjusted for
the year. 10 days of leave rather than the usual 5 were allowed to be carried forward. At the end
of each financial year we are required to assess the accrued costs associated with untaken leave

entitlement. With an assumption that most staff would have taken less leave this year the
accrual was increased by £0.8 million in comparison with previous years. This non-cash
adjustment will reverse in 2020/21.
Our budget for 2019/20 for the College (rather than the Group) aimed for us to move from an
underlying deficit of £5.9 million in 2018/19 to a deficit of £3.0 million in 2019/20 (where the
underlying position is before: adjustment to pension liabilities; restructuring costs; endowments;
profit on sale of fixed assets and gain/loss on investments). The outturn for the year was a
surplus of £1.9 million. With an estimated direct pandemic impact of around £1.4 million this
meant that the indirect effect, coupled with tighter budgetary control and receipt of income above
budget, led to a positive underlying variance of £3.4 million.
In summary, it is likely that even without the pandemic affecting us from the start of 2020 we
would have achieved a break-even underlying outturn for the year.
The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2017 with the effect
that the scheme deficit increased. A repayment plan was agreed in 2018/19 and the College
recognised the increase in its share of the pension liability. This had the effect of reducing total
comprehensive income for the year by £20.7 million. A joint Expert Panel (JEP) was set up with
members representing employers and members to review the assumptions used in the valuation.
A follow up valuation was undertaken at 31 March 2018 using slightly amended assumptions
recommended by the JEP. These assumptions led to a reduction in the scheme deficit and a
recovery plan with a slightly extended repayment period. The resulting impact on the College total
comprehensive income was an increase of £14.9 million. Although the pension schemes have a
material impact on the financial position of the College, the valuations create volatile changes to
the reported staff cost figures and are, therefore, excluded when we consider underlying
performance. A third valuation of the pension scheme is currently being undertaken and is likely
to have an impact in the 2021/22 financial year.

Following a number of years of income growth and the generation of surpluses, the impact on
enrolments of the EU referendum in 2016 and increasing pressure on our budget due to staff
costs, led to an adjusted deficit before other gains and losses of £0.9 million in 2017/18. This
increased to an underlying deficit of £5.0 million in 2018/19 as the College developed plans for
recovery (note that the adjusted deficit summarised in Table 5 is a slightly different calculation
than that used in the management accounts referred to earlier).

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
In June 2019, Governors agreed a recovery plan which aimed for an underlying budget deficit of
£3.0 million in 2019/20 followed by break-even the year after. Recognising the increased
competition for students as the UK leaves the EU, our recovery plan forecasts were set on
modest student number growth to 9,000 FTE. Although the forecasts prudently capped student
numbers against our existing portfolio we believe that there are opportunities and a number of
recovery projects were identified to grow and diversify income. At the same time, the recovery
plan required tight control over costs and a rebalancing of staff costs, both academic and
administrative.
The years of generating surpluses placed the College in a relatively strong position as it
embarked on financial recovery. The level of cash accrued provided Governors with assurance
that revenue recovery initiatives could be phased and that a couple of years of planned deficits
could be supported.
The arrival of Covid-19 at the start of 2020 and the quick move to lockdown and remote working
in April 2020 placed a significant strain on the UK and world economy and all businesses were
required to adapt quickly. The College quickly moved to remote working and teaching and then
began to develop and introduce plans to provide high quality on-line solutions for our students,
not just as a reactionary measure to the coronavirus, but as a longer term solution.
During the Spring of 2020 not only did we look at our operational plans we also developed
financial models to try and understand the short and medium term impact of the pandemic on
our finances. A number of underlying principles were agreed with Governors:
• We would need to invest to properly develop our response plans, particularly in respect of
delivering high quality education and support to our students;
• The pandemic would not alter our underlying structural challenges and we would need to
retain a focus on the outcomes articulated in our recovery plan;
• The cash reserves we had built up would provide us with a level of cover although any
substantial loss of income would require a reassessment of, and likely delays to, our
recovery plans;
• Although there was likely to be a significant negative impact on our financial position due
to the pandemic we would not seek to mitigate losses in a single year given the likelihood
of a general bounce-back in demand within the next few years.
As a consequence, our financial forecasts were adapted to try and split the direct and indirect
impact of the pandemic on income and expenditure from our underlying “business as normal”
position. This enabled us to determine how to remain on track against the critical recovery plan
we had already agreed whilst overlaying the financial cost of the virus. Using this model, financial
forecasts under a range of scenarios were developed for the following 10 years.
In addition to pessimistic, mid-case and optimistic student recruitment scenarios, a fourth
scenario was also developed which acted as a stress test of our continuing solvency ie how many
students would we need to lose before we required a significant response to remain solvent and
how might we deal with such a scenario. We felt that although this had a low probability it
indicated that preparing the ground for an application to the government backed Coronavirus
Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) would be a sensible risk mitigation strategy.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Additional committee meetings were introduced at the outset of the pandemic to help to develop
plans, monitor progress and provide appropriate governance. They included:
• More regular meetings of the College Health & Safety Committee;
• The creation of a coronavirus response group;
• A move to weekly meetings of the Recruitment Strategy and Planning Group;
• Weekly rather than monthly meetings of the Academic Executive Team (AET);
• The introduction of briefings for senior Governors between formal meetings (the group
included the Chair, Deputy Chair and the Chairs of Audit, Finance & General Purposes
and Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committees).
From a financial perspective, the single most important contributing factor to our financial
forecasts was student recruitment. A range of operational interventions were introduced to
ensure that applicants and current students were aware of the College strategy for teaching in
the Autumn. In simple terms, our messaging from the outset was that you could study the whole
of the 2020/21 academic year on-line if you wished through a combination of in-person
academic delivery (i.e. live lectures and tutorials) supported by self-study. On-campus activities
would be introduced where it was safe to do so but, with the exception of laboratory teaching,
these would not be compulsory to attend.
Our messaging to applicants and returning students was successful and enrolments exceeded
all the scenarios we had been modelling. Table 6 summarises enrolment data for our main
categories of student in comparison with 2019/20.
20199/220 20220/211 Change
Undergraduate degree full time 2,675 2,816 -2%
Undergraduate degree plus foundation year 527 811 +54%
Undergraduate degree part time 1,464 1,449 -1%
Postgraduate Masters degree full time 1,046 1,319 +26%
Postgraduate Masters degree part time 1,516 1,563 +3%

Table 7 summarises enrolment data for all students by domicile.

Home students 6,501 6,637 2%
EU students 1,456 1,580 +9%
International students 833 759 -9%
Table 7: Student enrolments (FTE) for all categories
Although the number of students on full time undergraduate programmes has fallen by 2% year
on year, this drop has been more than offset by the increase in numbers choosing to take an
additional foundation year to prepare for their studies. Total undergraduate enrolments across
the three modes of study has risen by 4.5%.
Our current forecasts for the year now assume that the negative direct and indirect impact of the
pandemic will be around £2.9 million but there will be no shortfall in tuition income. As a
consequence, we will be able to set a revised break-even budget inclusive of the pandemic costs.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
From a cash flow perspective we need to take note of further risks such as recruitment patterns
for 2021/22 after both Brexit and the pandemic. We expect the number of students from the EU
to fall and increases in pension contributions are also being estimated. Once again, a range of
scenarios has been considered. Capital plans will be reviewed in the Spring term as the forecasts
continue to evolve and at present it is only assumed that critical long-term maintenance will take
place. Due to the better than expected performance of both 2019/20 and 2020/21 we do not
currently anticipate any going concern issues and will not need to apply for CLBILS support. As
such the governors are satisfied that the accounts should be prepared on a going concern basis.
The pandemic has been a jolt to the system but our quick and collegial response has led to
strong recruitment. We need to continue to work on our recovery plan to return to surpluses of
5% of turnover and need to be very mindful that there are further uncertainties on the horizon.
We have a healthy cash balance, no loan debt to service and no student residences to worry
about so are likely to be in a more comfortable position than a number of higher education
institutions. We have a unique business model which has proved to be resilient during the
pandemic and which is well suited to take advantage of Government plans to upskill and reskill
the workforce to help strengthen the economy. Having rapidly developed a high quality on-line
teaching model delivered by research intensive academic staff we believe that we are in good
shape to continue to weather uncertainty and develop strategies to take advantage of future
opportunities.
Risk Management
An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
internal control last year and will continue to do so.
The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to
risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit
Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key
parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main
reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.
The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and
professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and
evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,
for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The
risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual
report on internal control and risk for 2019/20 was presented to the Audit Committee in May
2020.
In the Spring of 2020, KPMG undertook a scheduled review of strategic risk management at the
College as part of their internal audit plan for the year. The work to be undertaken was
summarised in their report as follows:
“We will undertake deep dives into a sample of the strategic risks recorded on the risk register in
order to assess the effectiveness of their management to achieve a tolerable level of risk. We will
consider whether mitigations implemented are appropriate to address the nature of the risk
identified, whether actions identified have been implemented as planned and whether they have
been effective in reducing the level of risk to an acceptable level.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
We will also review the governance structures in place for the oversight and monitoring of the
risks identified to consider whether they are sufficient to provide assurance to the Governors that
risks are being effectively managed.”
A number of areas of good practice were identified in their May 2020 report and an assurance
rating of “significant assurance with minor improvement opportunities” was determined. College
management agreed to implement a number of recommendations during 2020/21.
KPMG also presented a Reflections on Risk Management paper to the May 2020 Audit
Committee meeting as a direct response to the risk environment created by the pandemic. The
paper identified four stages of response to the pandemic: Reaction, Resilience, Recovery and
New Reality. The paper provided a helpful framework for the Committee and College
management to consider the heightened risks and develop plans to manage a period of
extended uncertainty.
Rather than add a wide-ranging (and possibly unmanageable) single Covid-19 risk to our risk
register we added a number of new columns to each of the separate risks in the risk register to
reflect the impact of the pandemic. The columns reflected the risks and our actions across the
four phases of response outlined by KPMG. The Resilience phase (the period during lockdown)
was also split into financial, operational and academic risk.
Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
(highest impact and likelihood) is 25.
The pandemic has naturally increased the scores for many of the existing risks in the register and
added some addition ones. The top risks for the College for 2020/21 outlined in the annual
report are:
• Student recruitment
Gross risk 22.50, residual risk 15.00 (2019/20: gross risk 18.00; residual risk 14.00)
Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance
on tuition fees as our main source of income. At the start of the 2019/20 student
recruitment cycle we put sustained and considerable effort into marketing and
recruitment with a new branding and advertising campaign. Centralised management of
routine admissions work which had been done in Schools and Departments was
introduced to improve efficiency and speed up the turnaround time of responses to
students. Monitoring of applications and offers was undertaken by the new Recruitment
Strategy and Management Group with action taken where improvement was needed.
There is still fierce competition for students among HE institutions, with private and
alternative providers joining universities on the OFS register. Coupled with a continuing
decline in the number of 18 year-olds many institutions that have not previously been
competitors have begun to edge into the more mature student market to maintain their
numbers. Despite the increased risks our mitigating actions allowed us to increase
numbers slightly in 2019/20 albeit that tuition income ended the year below budget (but
within the range allowed for by a contingency).
At the time of updating the risk register, the level of risk for 2020/21 recruitment had
been exacerbated by the pandemic: international students may not be able, or wish to,
Page 38

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
travel; students, particularly mature students, may choose to delay or defer their studies;
and competition for UK students, particularly in London, may increase as institutions look
to recoup income shortfalls from lower international student numbers. A second wave of
coronavirus infections looks likely in the autumn which may negatively impact student
intention.
The improvements introduced the previous year alongside a web site refresh, TV and
radio marketing campaigns and country and programme specific advertising have
resulted in us receiving the highest number of applications ever. From early in the lock
down we sent out a clear message to students that it would be possible to study the
whole year on-line with academic led lectures and seminars supplemented by optional
on-site activity where circumstances allowed. Recent activities have focussed on
conversion to enrolments.
Enrolment for 2020/21 has been strong and the risk will be reduced at the next review
point. However, it is likely that student recruitment will remain our highest risk for a
number of years to come.
• Financial sustainability
Gross risk 20.25, residual risk 12.25 (2019/20: gross risk 18.00; residual risk 12.25)
Following a number of years in which the College returned significant surpluses as a
percentage of income, post-referendum we have seen staff costs exceeding tuition
income for the first time as student numbers fell below our recruitment targets. A deficit
budget was set for 2018/19 and recovery plans were developed which aimed to return
us back to an underlying break-even position by 2020/21 (before exceptional
adjustments such as changes to the pension liability).
In April 2019 the Office for Students published a report titled Financial Sustainability of
Higher Education Providers in England which noted: “In a financially challenging
environment for higher education providers, and with the UK 18-year old population
continuing to decline in the short term, the OfS has particular concerns about the
credibility of providers’ student number forecasts. Our analysis suggests that over the
next few years the sector in aggregate is assuming a level of growth in student numbers,
and related fee income, which is not likely to be achievable.” Analysis of our own
enrolment trends concluded that forecasting growth for the College in the current
environment was risky and we based our financial forecasts (before the impact of the
pandemic) on static student numbers.
Having rebased our student recruitment target to the current level with an aspiration for
growth, rather than planning for growth, we focused on efforts to rebuild through the
Recovery Programme projects including Degree with Foundation Year, Access to
postgraduate taught programmes, digital provision, international programmes and short
courses/CPD, and the recommendations of the Student Experience Review.
Our strategy for reducing costs has led to a revised budget setting process based on
centrally agreed instructions rather than relying on amalgamating local plans. Around
£3.0 million in staff costs were saved following a Voluntary Severance and Early
Retirement scheme in the first half of 2019.
The pandemic has of course impacted on our recovery plans – student income in
2020/21 was uncertain when the risk was reviewed and our ability to continue to reduce
Page 39


================================================================================
PAGE 40
================================================================================

BBirkbeck, University of London
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2020
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
staff costs during a period of enforced remote working has been curtailed. Despite this,
we have continued to focus on recovery as well as the immediate issues associated with
dealing with the virus. Our management accounts have been adapted to separate
underlying business from the financial impact of the virus. Our financial forecasts will be
reviewed over the coming months and no doubt our plans will need to be adapted to
reflect the changed circumstances. We will ensure, however, that the principles behind
our recovery plan will remain to ensure that the College can quickly return to a financially
sustainable position in a post-Covid 19, post-Brexit environment.
• Cyber and data security
Gross risk 18.00, residual risk 12.25 (2019/20: gross risk 18.00; residual risk 14.00)
The score for this risk was raised in 2019/20 due to increased malicious activity seen
elsewhere during lockdown. Audit Committee have been focussing on both cyber security
and data protection and a number of projects were commenced prior to the pandemic.
These included working towards implementing recommendations to improve compliance
under GDPR legislation following an internal audit. An experienced IT Security Manager
has been appointed. This is likely to remain a significant risk indefinitely due to the
adaptability of those looking to breach security arrangements.
To recognise the highly uncertain period we are in due to the pandemic a number of additional
groups have been set up to monitor the developing situation and agree on mitigating actions
including: a new Covid-19 operations group meets weekly chaired by the College Secretary, The
Vice-Chancellor chairs weekly meetings of the Academic Executive Team (which previously met
monthly) and senior College staff brief the Chairs of the governing body committees on a regular
basis between formal meetings. Other College committees such as the Health & Safety
Committee have also been meeting more frequently. Formal reports on our pandemic responses,
future plans and the possible impact on our financial, academic and research position are
reported through the Strategic Planning Committee to Governors.
Brexit, the fluid political environment and the affordability/sustainability of the Universities
Superannuation Scheme are each risks with significantly uncertain outcomes which could have a
detrimental impact on the College in the future. We are unable to actively mitigate these risks
and can only lobby government or contribute to sector-wide consultations. Nevertheless, reports
on the possible impact on the College and associated risks are routinely prepared and discussed
at Strategic Planning Committee and with Governors.
Public Benefit Statement
The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:
“The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Act describes 13
broad areas of charitable activity. The Governing Body has regard to the Charity Commission’s
guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in the following manner.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2020
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The advancement of education
The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.
The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins
everything we do.
In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
the Charities Act (see below for examples). The following table summarises our research income
over the last three years:
20177/188 20188/199 20199/220
Research income (£’000) 12,941 8,839 8,411
Income as a percentage of total income 11.9% 8.4% 7.7%
Table 8: Research income trends
Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. The College currently has a
portfolio of live research projects linked to over £50 million in external grant funding.
The prevention or relief of poverty
The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
(prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.
Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to
educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who
may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for
mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through
our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution
and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented
groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students with a
route into our undergraduate programmes – an outcome that they may not previously have been
able to achieve. We remain committed to driving this agenda in the higher education sector.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are BAME
or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 93% of our part-time
students and 67% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who
wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities
for students who otherwise would not be able to study.
In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that
government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes
for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time
sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and
demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to
continue with our current approach on access.
The following sections are taken from the College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to
2024/25 as examples which demonstrate our performance against various measures in recent
years.
Higher education participation, household income, or socioeconomic status
We believe that providing part-time and flexible education can facilitate social and economic
mobility and we have a long and proud history of enabling learners who may not have previously
had the opportunity, to access degree-level study.
The standard measure of participation, POLAR3/4, does not work well in London, with very few
postcodes falling into the lowest quintiles despite London having significant areas of deprivation.
We, therefore, use the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) as a more robust measure of
the socio-economic backgrounds of our students. 61% of all undergraduate entrants come from
the lowest two quintiles of IMD deprivation with our own survey data showing a significant
proportion living in households with low annual income - 39% of full-time undergraduate students
living in households with an annual income of less than £25,000 per annum and 46% of part-
time students coming from a household with annual income below £40,000 per annum. These
rates have been consistent over a number of years in both full-time and part-time student
populations.
Attainment of a “good degree” can be a challenge for disadvantaged students. The gap between
those from the lowest quintiles and those from the highest at Birkbeck has considerably
improved amongst full-time students, from a gap of 17% in 2014/15 to 7% in 2017/18. This gap
is smaller than the sector and London averages. The gap in our part-time degree student
population is just above the sector average at 16% and is something we are developing
strategies to address.
To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by
providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In
addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.
We also offer all self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free
monthly instalments over the academic year.
Disability
Birkbeck admits a much larger proportion of students with disabilities than the sector as a whole:
over 23% of our full-time entrants in 2016/17 disclosed a disability compared with 13% in the
Page 42

sector (HESA 2017/18 data). 16% of our students have a mental health condition, with two
thirds of this group also having multiple disabilities. Our disabled students tell us that our
evening provision is helpful to them as their conditions often prevent them from travelling during
rush hour or attending morning lectures. It is not uncommon for a psychiatric care plan to
encourage a patient to embark on studies at Birkbeck as part of their recovery. We welcome this
client body and are committed to providing support to ensure a level playing field for such
students, to attain further qualifications and change their lives.
When looking at the continuation rates of students with disabilities compared to those without, at
Birkbeck they continue at the same rate as, or in the case of part-time, better than students with
no disabilities. In fact part-time students with disabilities at Birkbeck continue at a 9% higher rate
than their non-disabled peers (in the sector disabled students’ continuation is 6% poorer than
non-disabled). This positive gap has been seen consistently over the last few years and is
testament to the high levels of support they receive. Attainment of a good degree by disabled
students is also higher when compared to their non-disabled peers:
Ethnicity
Our widening access provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than
focusing on ethnicity but as our work is exclusively in London our approach means that we work
with high numbers of students from BAME groups. Consequently, our student body is ethnically
diverse. While the BAME proportion of London’s population is 40%, 56% of our full-time and 42%
of our part-time undergraduate entrants identify as BAME
Continuation and attainment gaps between different ethnic groups at the College are being
closely monitored and progress has been made over the last few years. As an example, whilst
continuation rates for black students are better than the sector average there is still a gap when
compared to all other students at the College, particularly for those studying part time (see Chart
11).

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The gap in attainment of a good degree in our black, compared to white, full-time student
population has improved from a high of 50% in 2014/15 to 31% now. Despite this considerable
improvement, the current gap, and the equivalent part-time gap of 39%, is concerning. We have
undertaken data analysis in order to understand this issue better, looking at factors including the
age and subject of study of black students. Through linear regression analysis we find these
attributes do not have any significant impact on the attainment of black students at Birkbeck. We
calculate that just under a third of the gaps in attainment are attributable to entry qualifications
and other student characteristics and that there is an “unexplainable” gap of 18% for full-time
and 24% for part-time students. Reducing these gaps in attainment is our main priority in the
Access and Participation Plan cycle.
The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science
According to a report and database recently published by Birkbeck and funded by the Arts and
Humanities Research Council, the museum sector in the UK has more than tripled in size since
1960, with numbers increasing from 1,052 in 1960 to 3,314 in 2015. The large-scale research
project documented and analysed the growth and development of the UK museum sector
between 1960 and 2020.
Expansion was mainly driven by the foundation of independent museums: since 1960, their
numbers have more than quadrupled and, as of 2017, independent museums made up 71.5% of
the sector. The majority of the new museums are also small (defined as having fewer than
10,000 annual visits), and now make up 56% of the sector. The rising numbers of small
independent museums point to the role of community and special interest groups in driving the
museums boom. These groups set up their own museums that address topics important to them.
The surge of local history museums is notable in this respect as they now account for almost a
quarter of the UK sector.
In 2016 the number of closures outpaced the number of openings for the first time and since
then the sector has contracted. In total, 758 museums closed between 1960 and 2017, which is
18.7% of the museums open during this period. In particular, the growth in the number of local
authority museums slowed from the 1990s onwards. The assumption that museums survive and
that they keep collections for posterity is misplaced. The project director, Professor Fiona
Candlin, Professor of Museology at Birkbeck, hopes that the research will shape the design of
policy and how we set about further research on the sector in the future
A free to use database containing information on over 4,000 museums, resources linked to the
project and links to the project publications can be found on the Mapping Museums website.
The advancement of environmental protection or improvement
Research led by Birkbeck’s Dr James Hammond indicates the presence of molten rock beneath
the Changbaishan/Mt. Paektu volcano, which was responsible for one of the largest volcanic
eruptions in known history -the ‘Millenium Eruption’ of 946 CE. The volcano sits in the
China/Korean peninsula. This study was the first cross-border study of the region, and therefore
represents a unique scholarly collaboration between the UK, China and the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK). Using data from both China and DPRK, Dr Hammond and his
colleagues from Beijing, Pyongyang and Cambridge examined the crustal structure underneath
the volcano. They found a sharp velocity reduction approximately 7km beneath the volcano,
extending approximately 30km from the volcano’s base. This suggests the presence of molten
rock beneath the base of the mountain showing the volcano to still be active.
This new evidence of an active magmatic system highlights the importance of sustained
operational surveillance going forward. Monitoring the volcano and the surrounding region

together with detailed study of past eruptions is vital in order to understand and predict its
activity, including the risk of future eruptions.
The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of
religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity
A report authored by Catherine Heard, Director of Birkbeck’s Institute for Crime & Justice Policy
Research (ICPR)’s World Prison Research Programme, and Research Fellow Helen Fair has found
that the misuse of pre-trial imprisonment is a major, but preventable, cause of prison
overcrowding; and a severe infringement of fundamental rights. It causes economic and social
harm, puts pressure on prison conditions and increases the risk of crime. Pre-trial detention
statistics held on ICPR’s World Prison Brief database showed that, since 2000, pre-trial prison
populations had grown substantially across much of the world. This is despite increased
availability of cheaper, less restrictive measures like electronic monitoring. The research included
analysis of national legal systems followed by interviews with 60 experienced criminal defence
lawyers across ten countries.
The research identified a number of issues including that people from backgrounds of
disadvantage are more likely to be arrested, often don’t have money to pay bail, are less likely to
have good legal representation – and for these reasons, are more likely to be detained pre-trial.
Aspects of the wider criminal justice ‘machinery’ are also part of the picture: under-resourced
police and prosecution services that can’t investigate quickly and effectively; inadequate legal
aid; lack of judges and court staff; unmodernised court infrastructure and technology; too few
alternatives to custody. All these factors lead to misuse and prolongation of pre-trial
imprisonment.
The authors hope that governments will address the issues including using cheaper and less
restrictive means to ensure that someone turns up to court.
The advancement of health or the saving of lives
Supported by funding from the Wellcome Trust a seven-year, multi-centre research study has
shed new light on how a painkiller commonly used by vets for cats and dogs could be repurposed
to fight drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). The drug, Carprofen, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) in the same group of painkillers as ibuprofen and aspirin and was first found to kill
the bacteria responsible for TB in research led by Professor Sanjib Bhakta, Professor of
Molecular Microbiology and Biochemistry, at Birkbeck in 2013. The new study, which has seen
Professor Bhakta working alongside scientists from five different research centres, has revealed
that the drug most likely works by inhibiting the ‘efflux mechanisms’ that protect bacteria from
substances that harm them.
The research also found that it is not possible to generate bacteria that are resistant to Carprofen
and that it most likely kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis through multiple routes. In addition, it
found that Carprofen can reverse antimicrobial drug resistance in TB. These important findings
offer the promise that, when used in combination with other drugs, Carprofen may prove effective
in the fight against both TB and importantly, drug-resistant TB, which can occur when the bacteria
become resistant to the two most powerful antibiotics used to treat it.
Every year worldwide over 10 million people are diagnosed with TB, and 1.6 million die of the
disease, mainly because they cannot get the drugs that would make them better.

The remit of the Audit Committee includes:
• Making recommendations to the governing body on the appointment of the External and
Internal Auditors;
• Meeting with the External Auditors to discuss their audit findings, and reviewing and
approving the audit aspects of the annual financial statements, providing Governors with
its own opinions based on the information available to it;

• Assessing compliance with external funding and regulatory bodies.
The Audit Committee’s role in relation to risk oversight and assurance is set out below.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee considers nominations for independent governor vacancies and the
membership of the Governors’ committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into
account the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of members and are based on
assessment against objective criteria. Nominations Committee also considers issues of
succession planning and diversity within the Governing Body, and confirms the appointment of
the Chair and Deputy Chair of Governors annually.
Strategic Estates and Infrastructure Committee
The Strategic Estates and Infrastructure Committee (SEIC) is responsible for overseeing and
advising Governors on the development and ongoing review of the College’s estates and
infrastructure strategy, in the context of the College’s overall plan and strategic objectives, It
advises Governors, in conjunction with F&GPC, on the College’s property portfolio and the

Strategic Planning Committee
The Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor and consists of College
officers with strategic management responsibility. Its remit is to act as the College’s Executive
Committee responsible for its effective and successful operation. SPC considers College-wide
strategic issues and priorities and advises Governors accordingly. It is responsible for internal
planning and resource allocation, policy and procedures. It oversees the annual planning and
budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and Professional Services on developing plans
and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for presentation to Finance and General Purposes
Committee.
Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee
Under the College Statutes Governors have oversight and responsibility for all the College’s
activities, but must consider the advice of the Academic Board on all academic matters.
Academic Board is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the College and
reports termly on the business it has considered. The Academic Board is chaired by the Vice-
Chancellor and has a membership of more than 150 drawn from academic and Library staff and
the students of the College. To increase the effectiveness of its decision making, it has
established the Academic Board Executive Committee (ABExCo) as its steering committee.

Chancellors, the Executive Deans of the academic Schools and the academic staff and student
Governors, all of whom are also members of the full Academic Board.
The membership of all of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-7
Statement of internal control
The Governing Body is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control that
supports the achievement of Birkbeck’s strategies, policies, aims and objectives whilst
safeguarding the public and external funds for which we are responsible, in accordance with the
responsibilities assigned to the governing body in the College Charter and Statutes and the public
interest governance principles set out in the regulatory framework for Higher Education in
England.
The system of internal control includes arrangements for the prevention and detection of
corruption, fraud, bribery and other irregularities. It is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to fulfil strategies, policies, aims and objectives and safeguard public funds,
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness.
The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify the principal
risks, evaluate the nature and extent of those risks and manage them efficiently, effectively and
economically. The process is regularly reviewed by Governors and accords with the principles in
the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.
Birkbeck manages risks through a Risk Register, which is reviewed each term by the College Risk
Management Group reporting to Strategic Planning Committee, and the Audit Committee
reporting to Governors. The College’s Risk Management Policy is reviewed annually by the Risk
Management Group and Audit Committee reporting to Governors.

STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)
The following processes have been established:
• The performance and strategic direction of Birkbeck is specifically considered each year
by the Strategic Planning Committee and the Governors at annual extended strategic
meetings;
• Governors agree and annually review Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic
objectives and risks;
• Governors receive termly and annual reports from the Audit Committee concerning
internal control and risk management;
• Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Internal Auditor, which include an
independent opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of Birkbeck’s system of internal
control, together with recommendations for improvement. Audit Committee may also
request additional reports to gain assurance from other parties on areas of concern;
• A risk prioritisation methodology based on assessment of likelihood and impact has been
established. The Risk Register covers corporate level risks, including ability to fulfil
Birkbeck’s aims and objectives and ability to continue to comply with its conditions of
registration with the Office for Students;
• Audit Committee receives regular reports from the College Risk Management Group, on
action taken to mitigate the risks and the impact of that action and on changes to the risk
profile including new risks;
• The College Ethics Committee makes an annual report to Audit Committee on its
operation, and also reports and provides assurance to Academic Board on ethical
matters related to research activities;
• There are comprehensive Financial Regulations, detailing financial controls and
procedures, approved by Governors on the advice of the Audit Committee and Finance
and General Purposes Committee;
• The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE
Code of Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of
the Code. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review
Birkbeck's processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code;
• The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14. The review concluded that
the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in place
measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more
opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings. The
diversity of the Governing Body has increased following the appointment of new
independent governors through an open call for expressions of interest;
• The Governing Body agreed to carry out a proportionate review of its effectiveness, based
on the CUC HE Code of Governance, in 2019/20 once the new Chair of Governors had
started his term of office. Due to the unexpected global pandemic and the impact of the
national lockdown on the College’s student services and operations, the review was
postponed temporarily. A decision will be made on taking this forward in the new
academic session 2020/21;

• Institution level collaborations are overseen by the College Collaborations Approval Panel
which reports to Strategic Planning Committee;
• Governors review annually their Statement of Primary Responsibility which covers
responsibilities reserved to Governors and responsibilities delegated to committees or to
the Vice-Chancellor.
There have been no significant internal control weaknesses or failures during this reporting
period. This statement is based on the information provided to Governors in the regular reports
on internal audit and risk management.
Governors have appointed a professional independent Internal Audit Service whose annual
programme is approved by the Audit Committee. The internal audit function provides, by
undertaking review, independent objective assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit
Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the design and
effectiveness of the operation of internal controls that are intended to control critical business
application risks. Internal audit also helps the College accomplish its objectives by bringing a
systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk
management, control and governance processes and, by working with management, adding
value through advice and guidance.
The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the
Audit Committee.
Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:
• the financial statements of the College give a true and fair picture of the state of its
affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cashflow for the financial
year;
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting
standards including the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction;
• external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those
purposes and managed appropriately;
• Income has been applied in accordance with the Office for Students’ Terms and
Conditions and the College Financial Regulations.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the College”) and
its subsidiary (“the Group”) for the year ended 31 July 2020 which comprise the Consolidated
and College Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure, Consolidated and College
Statement of Changes in Reserves, the Consolidated and College Balance Sheets and notes to
the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion, the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the College’s affairs as at 31
July 2020 and of the Group’s and the College’s income and expenditure, gains and
losses, changes in reserves and of the group’s and the College’s cash flows for the year
then ended; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Group and College in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK)
require us to report to you where:
• the board of governors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of
the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the board of governors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or College’s
ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least
twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Other information
The board of governors are responsible for the other information. Other information comprises
the information included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information including the Strategic Report and Statement of Corporate Governance and Internal

Controls and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters required by the Office for Students (“OfS”) and Research England
In our opinion, in all material respects:
• Funds from whatever source administered by the high education institution for specific
purposes have been properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with
relevant legislation.
• Funds provided by the OfS, UK Research and Innovation (including Research England),
have been applied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions
• The requirements of the OfS’s Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) have been met.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the OfS requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• The College’s grant and fee income, as disclosed in the note to the accounts, has been
materially misstated.
• The College’s expenditure on access and participation activities for the financial year has
been materially misstated.
Responsibilities of the governors’
As explained more fully in the governors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 46-51 the
governors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the governors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the governors are responsible for assessing the Group and
the College’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the governors either
intend to liquidate the Group or the College or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these financial statements.

SStatement of Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 July 2020
(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:17) Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended(cid:3)
Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial(cid:3)
Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of(cid:3)
Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit(cid:3)
requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost(cid:3)
convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
The College's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and(cid:3)
position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.
Going Concern
The challenges faced as a result of Covid-19 have been considered in detail through stress testing and(cid:3)
consideration of key risks. During the Spring of 2020 not only did we look at our operational plans we also(cid:3)
developed financial models to try to understand the short and medium term impact of the pandemic on(cid:3)
our finances and our financial sustainability. We developed three scenarios chiefly based on the outcome(cid:3)
of recruitment for the academic year 2020/21 and the impact on cash reserves, the details of which are(cid:3)
presented on pages 35-37 of the Annual Report.
Due to the better than expected performance of 2019/20, and 2020/21 recruitment to date we do not(cid:3)
currently anticipate any going concern issues. Our current forecasts for the year 2020/21 now assume(cid:3)that
the negative direct and indirect impact of the pandemic will be around the £2.9 million. We have(cid:3)adjusted
our budget to accommodate this and will deliver a breakeven budget as planned prior to the(cid:3)outset of the
pandemic.
The College does not have any loans or student residences and having recruited to target there are no(cid:3)
material risks. As a consequence, the Governors have a reasonable expectation that the College has(cid:3)
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus it continues to(cid:3)
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
(cid:21)(cid:17) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to 31(cid:3)July
2020. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial year-end of the College's subsidiary, Cambridge House Ltd, is 31 October. Transactions to 31(cid:3)
July 2020 are included in the consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union(cid:3)
as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
(cid:22)(cid:17) Income recognition
Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive(cid:3)
Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms(cid:3)
of the contract have been satisfied.
Fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the Consolidated(cid:3)
Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.(cid:3)
Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is(cid:3)
shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not deducted(cid:3)
from income.
Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure(cid:3)
on a receivable basis.

33. IIncome recognition (continued)
GGrant funding
Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and RE research and research grants, are(cid:3)
recognised as income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the(cid:3)
grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as(cid:3)
deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after(cid:3)
more than one year as appropriate.
Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the(cid:3)
College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income
received(cid:3)in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income
within(cid:3)creditors and released to income as the conditions are met.
Donations and endowments
Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is
utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to
the terms applied to the individual endowment fund.
There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
a) Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular
objective;
b) Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
invested to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College; and
c) Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
invested to generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
Capital grants
Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the
funds were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the
College has satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
4. Accounting for retirement benefits
College staff are members of two principal pension schemes -the Universities Superannuation
Scheme (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The
schemes are primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued
every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries.
Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and
liabilities of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as
a defined contribution retirement benefit schemes.
A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
schemes.

44. AAccounting for retirement benefits (continued)
DDefined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
DDefined benefit plan
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to
determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
55. Employment benefits
Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are
accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused
entitlement.
66. Finance leases
Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.

SStatement of Accounting Policies (continued)
for the year ended 31 July 2020
77. Service concession arrangements
Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
financial liability.
Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
arrangement.
88. Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.
99. FForeign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income and
Expenditure for the year.
110. FFixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
assets.
LLand and buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.
The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
depreciated as follows:
Buildings: 40 to 100 years
Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years
Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years
Leasehold land: the life of the lease
Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.

110. FFixed assets (continued)
EEquipment
Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
equipment is capitalised.
Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
lives are as follows:
-Computer hardware: 3 years
-Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
-Other equipment: 3 to 5 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
Balance Sheet.
111. HHeritage assets
Works of art and other valuable artefacts have been capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not depreciated
as their long economic life means that any depreciation would not be material.
112. IIntangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial
phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current intangible asset is 8 years.
113. IInvestments
Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
year.
114. CCash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months and
overdrafts.

115. PProvisions
Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:
a) The College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
b) It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
116. TTaxation
The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is
potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered
by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable
purposes.
The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
cost.
The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial
organisation.
117. RReserves
Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
must hold in perpetuity.
Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.
118. JJudgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In preparing these financial statements the College has made the following judgements:
a) As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is recognised as a
liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan agreed in the 2018
actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of future salaries between
1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each triennial valuation of the
scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future salary inflations, changes in
staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out in note 28.

The Remuneration Committee took the decision that the 2019/20 pay review processes for: Senior
College post holders – the Vice Chancellor, Deputy Vice Chancellor, Pro Vice Chancellors, College Secretary
and Executive Deans; and, Professorial and Director level Professional Services staff would not run during
the year.
The Committee recognise the ongoing contribution from senior staff but equally view it as important that(cid:3)
there is visible leadership from the College’s senior management and the senior members of the College
community in the current climate. In reaching this decision the Committee was mindful both of the position

99a Access and Particpation (continued)
The Student Experience Review (SER) completed in 2018/19 informs all aspects of our Access and
Participation Plan delivery and implementation of the SER enhances the experience of our students to
promote student success. This is a multi-year enhancement programme, accelerated in 2019/20, with
a strategic focus of reallocating expenditure from financial support to student success as noted in
section four of the 2019/20 access and participation plan. The focus of new activities and resources is
on improving student retention and student success.
In the 2018/19 academic year we reviewed our student financial support package and replaced the
Birkbeck undergraduate bursary scheme with the Birkbeck Needs Based Assessment (BNBA). The
Birkbeck undergraduate bursary scheme was a fixed amount given to all students who met the
eligibility criteria whereas the BNBA provides support based on need, on a student’s application. This
review was part of the wider move to invest more in student success and outcomes, and less in
student financial support.
The rationale for this change is that:
• the introduction of the student maintenance loan for part-time students meant for the first time
most of Birkbeck’s undergraduate students had access to funding for living costs. As a result, the

• our expenditure on student financial support was significantly above benchmark for the sector. In
2017/18 over half of our access agreement expenditure was on financial support, and our
expenditure was 28.4% of additional fee income (benchmark: 22.5%);
• in the context of the SER - a major review of Birkbeck’s approach to education for all students –
the College decided to invest significantly in student success – i.e. support services for students
and interventions to support better outcomes.
The fundamental shift in financial support available (maintenance loans and the introduction of BNBA)
introduced considerable uncertainty into modelling both the uptake of BNBA, and the spend per
student. The model was based on the Birkbeck bursary scheme and the expectation that most eligible
students would apply for the support however the uptake was much lower. This is not linked to
eligibility as 90% of students who applied for the support received it.
We see a similar underspend in 2019/20, chiefly due to:
• the access and participation plan for 2019/20 being submitted in May 2018, before the
2018/19 uptake of the BNBA was known;
• recruitment of undergraduate students in 2019/20 being 8% lower than expected;
• the introduction of the part-time maintenance loan by the Government for 2018/19 being
significantly delayed (students were only able to apply for the scheme from summer 2018) and
the availability of the new loans was not widely publicised by government. This meant that the
impact of maintenance loans on demand for the BNBA was not properly understood in 2018/19,
and using the 2018/19 experience to model 2019/20 was not appropriate;

Pension provision
The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the
contractual obligation with the USS to make deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan.
In calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the
duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out in note 28.
The adoption of the deficit recovery plan following the 2017 actuarial valuation gave rise to an increase of
£11.1 million in the deficit provision at the last year-end. The 2018 actuarial valuation, completed shortly
after the 2018/19 year-end, agreed a new deficit recovery plan. This has reduced the provision from £31.9
million to £14.4 million.
See also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs. More details on the 2018 actuarial
valuation are set out in note 28.
Other provisions
A provision has been recognised for amounts which may become due to be paid after the year-end. This
provision relates to restructuring that took place before the year-end.

225 Related party transactions
All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any significant
personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the composition of the Board of
Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations) it is inevitable that transactions will take
place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of staff may have an interest.
The College has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 102 and has not disclosed transactions with its wholly owned
subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Limited.
During the year the group entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related parties.
Transactions entered into, and balances outstanding at 31 July 2020 are as follows:

The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students' Union as the
College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £340,000 (2018/19: £340,000) was
provided to the Union.
In 2018/19 a loan of £175,000 was issued to the Students' Union. The loan was issued to support the Students' Union
return to a position of financial sustainability. The loan is repayable over seven years, no interest is due. The loan
outstanding as at 31 July 2020 was £140,000.
At the year-end there was no balance due to the Students' Union (2018/19: £83,000). As at 31 July 2020 a balance of
£53,000 was due from the Students' Union (2018/19: Nil)

226 Pension schemes
Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
• Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS); and
• The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL).
Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered
funds.
The total cost charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure was:

((i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)
The institution participates in Universities Superannuation Scheme. The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,
providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme
are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are
not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore
exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by Section 28
of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a wholly defined
contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the
contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan)
that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a
liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit)
and therefore an expense is recognised.
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a
collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a
scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as
Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has
entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the
recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they
relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.
College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-
employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under
the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.

The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2018 (the(cid:3)
valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method. A valuation as at 31 March 2020 is
underway. As the valuation has only recently commenced there is still work to be done agreeing the technical
provisions assumptions, the extent of future investment risk, the duration of the deficit and the level of
deficit contribtions. Rule changes in respect of strengthening the employer covenant are also in progress
including restrictions on employer exits, debt monitoring and pari passu arrangements. The valuation must
be completed by 30 June 2021. However it is generally anticipated that there will be a significant increase in
the deficit provision.
Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the
following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.
The 2018 valuation was the fifth valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime
introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to
have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of
the assets of the scheme was £63.7 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £67.3
billion indicating a shortfall of £3.6 billion and a funding ratio of 95%.
In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its
obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).
The key financial assumptions used in the 2018 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the
Statement of Funding Principles.
Years 1-10: CPI - 0.14% reducing linearly to CPI - 0.73%
Discount rate (forward rates)
Years 11-20: CPI + 2.52% reducing linearly to CPI +
1.55% by year 21
Years 21 +: CPI + 1.55%
Term dependent rates in line with the difference
Pension increase (CPI)
between the Fixed Interest and Index Linked yield
curves, less 1.3% p.a.
The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based
on analysis of the scheme's experience carried out as part of the 2018 actuarial valuation. The mortality
assumptions used in these figures are as follows:
Mortality base table 2018 Valuation
Pre-retirement:
71% of AMC00 (duration 0) for males and 112% of
AFC00 (duration 0) for females.
Post-retirement:
97.6% of SAPS S1NMA "light" for males and 102.7% of
RFV00 for females.
Future improvements to mortality CMI_2017 with a smoothing parameter of 8.5 and a
long term improvement rate of 1.8% pa for males and
1.6% pa for females.

The current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:
22018 2017
valuation valuation
Males currently aged 65 24.4 24.6
Females currently aged 65 225.9 26.1
Males currently aged 45 26.3 26.6
Females currently aged 45 27.7 27.9
The funding position of the scheme has since been updated on an FRS 102 basis:
2019 2018
Total scheme assets ££67.4bn £63.6bn
Total scheme liabilities £79.2bn £72.0bn
FRS 102 total scheme deficit ££11.8bn £8.4bn
FRS 102 total funding level 885.0% 88.0%
A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2018 valuation, which requires payment of 2% of
salaries over the period 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2021 at which point the rate will increase to 6%.
The provision figures have been produced using the following assumptions.
2020 2019
Discount rate 0.73% 1.58%
Pensionable salary growth 0.79% 1.02%
The 2020 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan. In accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 and the
SORP, the College has made a provision for this contractual commitment to fund the past deficit.
The reduction in the term of the deficit recovery plan agreed in the 2018 valuation has given rise to a
substantial reduction in the deficit provision which has decreased from £31.8 million to £16.9 million for this
year-end as set out in note 17. £14.9 million of this decrease is attributable to the change in the deficit
contributions contractual commitment. See also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs/gains.
Employer and employee contribution rates for the scheme during the last two years were:
Employer Employee
From October 2019 21.1% 9.6%
April - September 2019 19.5% 8.8%
To March 2019 18.0% 8.0%

((ii)(cid:3)The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)
The College participates in SAUL, which is an independently(cid:3)managed pension scheme for the non(cid:3)
academic staff of over 50 colleges and institutions with links to higher education in London. Pension
benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings ("CARE") basis.
Following a consultation with members the final salary section closed from 31 March 2016 and all
members build up benefits on a CARE basis. At the same time that benefits changed, SAUL's employers
agreed to increase their ongoing contributions to 16% while the member rate remained at 6%. These rates
remain unchanged.
The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the(cid:3)
State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the
S2P.
The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations
under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the
amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.
SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The actuarial method
used in the calculation of Technical Provisions is the Projected Unit Method and is based on pensionable
service. The trustees adopt assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for
pensions and benefits already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from
members’ accrued pension rights to be met. The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and
employers in June 2018 and are due to be reviewed at SAUL's next formal valuation in 2020.
A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.
Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.
The valuation carried out as at 31 March 2017 showed that SAUL had assets of £3.2 billion against(cid:3)
liabilities of £3.1 billion, representing a funding level of 102% on a Technical Provisions basis. SAUL was
fully funded on its Technical Provisions basis so no deficit contributions were required. The cost of accrual
was 28.7% versus member and employer contributions of 22%, the difference being known as the
contribution strain.
SAUL's most recent review undertaken as at 31 March 2019 indicates the scheme's surplus was £104m:
equivalent to a funding level of 103% and representing an improvement in the scheme's funding position
compared to both the 31 March 2017 valuation and the expected position at 31 March 2019.
The 2020 valuation is underway with the final outcomes to be agreed by 30 June 2021.
Details of the scheme and the 2017 valuation can be found at www.saul.org.uk.
