OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Master’s Report
The strategic direction of Birkbeck
During the year, the College updated its corporate plan to cover the
period to 2020. This five year plan covers a period following recovery
from significant turbulence in the HE sector. The impact of the 2012
funding policy changes to undergraduate fees and funding led to
reductions of 40% in the numbers of new part-time and mature
students nationally. Over the three years since 2012 our own part
time degree intake has halved and we have taken concerted action
to recover student numbers, most notably in the continuing
expansion of intensive three year undergraduate degree provision.
Demand for these programmes has increased significantly across all
Schools as we ensure our course provision responds to changing
student needs and capitalises fully on our reputation and brand
position at the forefront of the part-time sector.
We positioned ourselves financially in anticipation of the impact of the 2012 changes, building
upon the major transformation we delivered in successfully responding to the withdrawal of
funding for ELQ (equivalent or lower qualifications) in 2009. Since then the College has
intentionally built up the strength of its base operating position, returning operating surpluses
between 6.5% and 9.2% between 2010/11 and 2014/15.
We are planning to deliver a similar performance in the future, putting us in a position to further
invest in the development of academic provision, facilities, student support and research. While
our financial forecasts reflect the income consequences of reduced part-time student intakes,
they also include the positive contribution of the expanding three year intensive provision, the
impact of improved student retention and the impact of continuing cost reduction, control and
value for money initiatives.
A major area of growth over 2015-2020 will be the continuing expansion of demand and
provision of intensive evening degrees for a younger body of students from the London area and
beyond who wish to combine study with work and complete their degree in three or four years.
We will develop and offer appropriate facilities and support to maintain a diverse body of younger
students on these programmes.
We will also maintain our commitment to open, inclusive and flexible opportunities for all
Londoners, by maintaining part-time pathways in all subject areas allowing people to combine
evening study with work and other commitments. We will continue to ask for policy interventions
to support this student body and ensure that lifelong learning is maintained; and we will continue
to develop and offer a range of open, inclusive and low risk pathways into undergraduate study
through our Certificate of HE programme, the largest in the country.
We are committed to maintaining a broad portfolio accessible to diverse student populations,
both in terms of our mission and to mitigate the risk of unexpected policy and market changes.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
Birkbeck set out his vision:
‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’.
This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,
work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer
transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,
practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will maintain and develop our
distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and
better space and facilities for all of our activities.
Awards
Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards received during
the year:
Award-winning writer Marina Warner CBE, Professor of English and Creative Writing in the
Department of English and Humanities in Birkbeck’s School of Arts was made a Dame in the New
Year Honours list. She was awarded a DBE for services to higher education and literary
scholarship. Professor Warner joined Birkbeck in September 2014 and lectures on literature and
creative writing.
In March 2015, Professor Warner was also awarded one of the world’s most prestigious scholarly
prizes, The Holberg Prize, beating over 70 nominees from universities across the globe.
The award – worth approximately £380,000 – is presented annually to scholars who have made
outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social science, law or theology.
Professor Warner received this year’s honour for her work on the analysis of stories and myths
and how they reflect their time and place.
For the second time in three years a Birkbeck psychologist has been awarded the Spearman
Medal. Dr Iroise Dumontheil, a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Psychological Sciences, was
named as this year’s recipient for her work investigating a region of the brain at the crossroads of
executive control and social cognition. The Spearman Medal – inaugurated in 1965 and the
oldest award of the British Psychological Society - is awarded annually to an early-career
psychologist for outstanding published work in psychology, and has been won by many of the
major figures in UK psychology.
Dr Mai Sato, Research Fellow in the Institute for Criminal Policy Research in Birkbeck’s School of
Law, was awarded the Young Criminologist 2014 prize by the Japanese Association of
Sociological Criminology for her book The Death Penalty in Japan: Will the Public Tolerate
Abolition? Dr Sato completed her PhD in 2011 which examined public attitudes to the death
penalty in Japan. Dr Sato is currently funded by the UK, German and Norwegian embassies to
conduct further empirical work on the death penalty in Japan.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Professor Leslie Moran was honoured as a “legal hero” by the Law Society of England and Wales,
for his work putting Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) issues on the legal research
agenda. Professor Moran, Director LLM/MA in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at Birkbeck’s
School of Law, has been involved in a number of pioneering research projects focusing on
sexuality in criminal justice contexts. Most recently his research has focused on hate crime.
A Birkbeck alumnus has been awarded the Légion d'Honneur for his involvement in the
emancipation of France during World War II. Dr Tony Atcherley who is now 90 studied Philosophy
at Birkbeck in the 1950’s at the College’s Faculty of Continuing Education. Dr Atcherley received
the accolade – the highest decoration in France – in recognition of his service as a wireless
operator in the Royal Corps of Signals. Dr Atcherley confirmed that the unique mission of
Birkbeck was as true when he studied as it was when the College was founded in 1823. After
receiving his award he stated: “Back then, it was difficult to go to university if you didn’t have the
normal background of completing a grammar school education and so on. Getting on to the
ladder was difficult. The only chance anyone had was Birkbeck. It had a fine reputation and some
famous historians were there. It was full of very distinguished scholars.”
Research
Maintaining and developing the research excellence of the College is, of course, central to our
overall strategy ensuring that our unique population of students is taught by those at the cutting
edge of their subject who apply research insights to their teaching.
The results of the 2014 Research Excellent Framework (REF) were released at the end of 2014
and convincingly demonstrated Birkbeck’s position as a high quality research intensive
institution. Approximately three-quarters of the research submitted by the College was rated
either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). This represents a considerable
improvement on the results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) when 56% of our
research was rated 4* or 3*, paralleling the considerable improvement overall in the sector.
Part of this overall improvement in the sector was the result of strategic decisions of individual
universities to submit a lower proportion of their staff for assessment. Most importantly, Birkbeck
submitted 83% of eligible staff for assessment, well above the national average. This resulted in
our appearing higher up in league tables which took into account percentage of staff submitted
rather than simply overall grade point average of research. For example, the table in the Times
Higher Education magazine on 1st January 2015 placed us 30th overall, above Russell group
members such as Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, Queen Mary, Sheffield and York. Similarly, the College
performed strongly in league tables based simply on percentage of 4* research submitted
indicating the very high quality of much of our research.
The College’s science submissions performed particularly well, with Psychological Sciences rated
5th in the UK and the two joint submissions with UCL – Earth Systems & Environmental Sciences,
and Biological Sciences – rated 6th and 11th respectively. Birkbeck’s outstanding subjects in the
Times Higher Education’s ‘research-intensity’ league tables include Law, ranked 6th overall and
History, ranked 7th.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Although the final score for each submission was primarily determined by the quality of the
research papers submitted, the overall score also contained assessments of research impact
and research environment. The College did well in these specific areas with eight of our
submissions (Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, Biological Sciences, Earth Systems &
Environmental Science, Law, Modern Languages/Linguistics, English, History and Art & Design)
achieving the highest ratings for research environment. This confirmed the College’s status as
one of the UK’s leading institutions in which to conduct research. Similarly, three of these areas,
Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, History and Art & Design also scored 100% in the impact
area indicating the manner in which our research is applied to specific issues in the outside
world.
Although the figures on research environment and research impact are good they lagged behind
the scores for research publications. This indicated that it may be appropriate to provide further
institutional support for research policy, strategy and infrastructure as well as continuing the
College Anniversary Research Studentships.
Overall, this was an excellent performance made particularly impressive by the fact that the
research being assessed was conducted whilst the College was passing through two major
student funding crises (the removal of funding for students undertaking a second undergraduate
degree and the increase in tuition fees to £9,000, both of which impacted significantly on part
time student numbers) with College staff being strongly focused on teaching and student
recruitment, potentially at the expense of their research activity.
We are now considering how to continue our improvement in research at a rate greater than the
rest of the sector prior to the next REF. It is likely that this strategy will include a focus on career
development which focuses on both teaching and research.
In the science area, creating career development opportunities were a key part of the £600,000
award to the College from the Wellcome Trust under the Institutional Strategic Support Fund
(ISSF). The College was invited to compete for this award as one of the 25 UK Higher Education
Institutions with the greatest funding from the Wellcome Trust. We were successful in this
competitive process, with an application which emphasized our strengths not only in Biological
Sciences but also in the Medical Humanities, an area also funded by the Wellcome Trust. The
funding supported an appointment in the area of public understanding of science, several
Fellowship appointments for young researchers to prepare for their first independent position
and pump priming research funds for those who already held an independent position. A novel
aspect of the scheme was to provide assistance to PhD students who have submitted their thesis
but needed a further period of funding to complete their scientific publications ready for
submission. Several of these funding schemes may be mimicked in future with College funds
across areas outside the scope of the ISSF support.
In terms of the financial support for research, it is pleasing to report that despite an increasingly
competitive environment for project-based research funding, the College’s research income
released to the Income and Expenditure Account remained relatively stable at £10.4 million in
2014/15 (2013/14: £11.1 million). The number of new grants awarded during the year was 49
totalling £7.6 million.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
In December 2014 the Times Higher Education magazine produced a summary of research grant
applications to the six UK research councils. The data showed that of those institutions
submitting at least 10 bids in 2013/14, Birkbeck had the third highest success rate at 45%. In
terms of the value of the funding awarded, Birkbeck was 47th out of 148 institutions. In the arts
and humanities, the College received the fifth highest amount of funding among UK institutions
form the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC).
Our success in driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit
criteria outlined in the Charities Act. Some of the grants which were awarded this year are
summarised in the Public Benefit Statement starting on page 21.
The excellence of our staff and their research successes were responsible for our continuing
good position in University League Tables. We were positioned 290th in the latest QS World
University Rankings (up from 431st in 2014). This placed us 39th in the UK, and within London -
which QS ranks as the third best student city in the world - Birkbeck was ranked 8th (2014: 10th).
Moreover, for research the College was ranked 16th in the UK for citations per faculty. This table
has become even more competitive as a greater number of universities, particularly from Asia,
compete for recognition.
Estates
It is of vital importance that we provide the very best facilities for our research, as well as
ensuring that high quality teaching facilities are provided for students. Each year we put aside
funding from our own resources to carry out a number of improvement projects (14/15 revenue
budget £700,000; 15/16 revenue budget £500,000) on top of undertaking minor works and
routine maintenance.
Although Government/HEFCE funding for capital facilities has been greatly reduced in recent
years, we have been successful in obtaining matched funding of £650,000 from HEFCE for new
Earth Sciences Laboratories. With a total development cost of £1.3 million, the laboratories will
greatly enhance the research and teaching facilities available to the College and since they will
also be used by UCL during the day, will further the close links between two academic
departments which proved so successful in the recent REF. The new laboratory was opened at
the end of September 2015 and includes an innovative interaction between PC and microscope
which is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK.
The model of evening use of teaching facilities by Birkbeck and daytime use by a partner is of
considerable significance for the future of the College. Following recent property transfers within
our joint building with UEL in Stratford, much of the space is now used by UEL in the daytime and
by us in the evening. Similarly, the SOAS development in the North Block of Senate House is
predicated on our use of the facilities in the evening with SOAS being the users during the day.
This joint use of facilities provides us with an effective say in the management of the teaching
facilities we are using whilst providing us with a partner to share the cost in their construction
and running. Moreover, electronic signage allows the space to be identified as Birkbeck space
from 6.00 pm, so providing our students with the feeling that they are studying in Birkbeck
facilities rather in a random space which is available for rental during the evening.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Currently a significant proportion of our teaching activity is undertaken in premises which are
rented from local providers in Bloomsbury. Some of the space is not of the high standard that we
would like to offer all our students and in some cases operational challenges have been
experienced. It is now a strategic objective that by our 200th anniversary in 2023 all Birkbeck
students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or in shared facilities operating
on a similar basis to the projects with UEL and SOAS.
We have been planning the development of a new building to house a Toddler Laboratory for the
Department of Psychological Sciences, building on the great success of the Baby Laboratory in
terms of identifying early markers of autism, potentially allowing much earlier interventions
before the onset of the symptoms. Following the receipt of major donations from the Wohl
Foundation (£1.3 million) and the Wolfson Foundation (£800,000), Governors made the decision
to proceed with this project.
Our cash reserves have increased over the last few years and this has enabled the College to
consider the opportunity to invest in major estates projects. With an estates strategy that focuses
on research and the need to increase the amount of owned teaching space, the College
commenced a process to find suitable freehold property in the locality of the main College
buildings in Bloomsbury. Following an unsuccessful bid on one property we completed the
acquisition of a property on the Euston Road between Warren Street and Great Portland Street
tube stations.
Various indicative plans have been developed for the 1,100 square metre property and detailed
plans for the various options will be drawn up over the coming months. The options under
consideration range from simple refurbishment to demolition and construction. Uses could
include research or office space. The building cost £15.4 million excluding fees and VAT to
purchase.
Teaching excellence
We are committed not only to teaching excellence, but to the innovative organization and flexible
delivery of our teaching in ways that genuinely respond to the needs of our students.
The College’s Strategy for Learning and Teaching Enhancement aims to deliver that commitment,
providing a strategic framework for the development of learning and teaching at Birkbeck. It aims
to ensure the best possible learning experience in higher education for the widest range of
students, enabling our students to realise their full potential in an academic culture of developing
and enhancing excellence in teaching. It aims to encourage, develop and enhance the pursuit of
knowledge through an integrated, flexible and innovative approach to learning and teaching,
working with new methodologies and new technologies in learning, teaching and assessment;
and to develop and enhance our approaches to learning and teaching enhancement through
awareness of student diversity and issues of equality.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Accelerated, flexible, evening study combined with daytime work is becoming a popular choice.
Students can work or seek work during the day while finishing their degree in the same time as a
conventional full-time student would. Our research indicates that this provision appeals more and
more to younger prospective students from backgrounds where university study is not the norm
and who would otherwise not go to university, as well as to students who want or need to work
while studying and would prefer a more intensive evening model. In response to higher fees and
difficult economic circumstances, these students have a preference to realise the benefits of
completed study sooner rather than later, and to have a flexible study model that gives far
greater scope, and far more explicit support, for interactions with the world of work whilst
studying. Meanwhile for some young students, intensive evening study may become the only
alternative to not studying at all
Just as significantly, this trend increasingly determines study preferences in the postgraduate
market. A postgraduate qualification is seen as increasingly important in career advancement,
yet at the postgraduate level there is clear under representation of certain groups of non-
traditional students. Even with postgraduate student loans, which under current plans will not be
available for mature students at all, such students may well see the intensive evening route as
the only way to make study at Master’s level affordable and accessible.
We will continue with our Catalyst programme (initially funded by HEFCE) to pioneer the
development and delivery of innovative, flexible and accelerated evening provision at both
undergraduate and postgraduate taught levels, building on our sector-leading expertise in
supporting adult learning. We will further develop our flexible fee and enrolment infrastructure
enabling flexibility in terms of programme structure, new course development and the speed and
intensity at which students proceed and we will continue to develop provision that wraps
meaningful work skills and experience around high-quality academic evening study in new and
innovative ways that meet the needs of a variety of diverse non-traditional adult students.
In 2014/15 we introduced lecture recording facilities to our classrooms, enabling students to
review material and catch up on missed classes in their own time. We will bring further
innovation to the classroom, in the context of clearly changing student circumstances and needs,
evaluate and, where appropriate, integrate into the College’s course portfolio innovative teaching
and learning practice and new delivery technologies, including expansion of online and distance
learning provision, underpinned by both our own resources and by opportunities for collaboration
and partnership where there is a strategic fit.
With a Teaching Excellence Framework under consideration by the government the College has
always been committed to teaching excellence. In the most recent National Student Survey
(NSS), staff in the School of Arts were rated top in the UK by students for key aspects of their
teaching. Staff across all four departments in the School were top nationally in explaining
concepts, conveying their enthusiasm for their subject and in making what they were teaching
interesting to students. 100% of students surveyed in the School confirmed that they were
satisfied with the style and approach of the teaching and that they found their course of study
‘intellectually stimulating’.

Birkbeck’s part-time students are also more likely to be in employment or further study six
months after graduating than students from any other university in London according to Higher
Education Statistics Agency’s (HESA) analysis released in August 2015. Over recent years, the
College has expanded a range of services dedicated to improving graduate employability
including: setting up Birkbeck Talent which brings together businesses from across London who
are looking for talented and committed graduates and Birkbeck students wanting meaningful
employment whilst they study; and a popular “What Employers Want” series which provides
students and recent graduates with an opportunity to get advice from Birkbeck alumni on their
careers paths.
2014/15 was a very successful year for the College, both financially and academically. We are
continuing with the academic and student support developments that are essential to creating
the best possible environment for our students and we are developing a strategy for investment
in the College estate, something which is essential for the long term sustainability and
development of our teaching and research. On the back of a very strong performance in the
2014 REF we will implement our updated strategy for excellent and distinctive research. Looking
further ahead, we will be defining our ambitions and vision for Birkbeck in 2023, when the
College will celebrate its 200th anniversary.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Financial Report of the Chair of Governors
The Financial Statements presented to the Governors
comprise the consolidated results of the College and its
subsidiary. The principal activities undertaken by the Group
are teaching and research together with ancillary activities
necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include
rendering academic services to a variety of educational,
commercial and other organisations
Results for the Year
The College’s income and expenditure for the last three years can be summarised as follows:
2012/13 2013/14 2014/15
£’000 £’000 £’000
Funding Council grants 27,681 24,522 22,758
Tuition fees and support grants 51,741 57,796 63,887
Research grants and contracts 9,157 11,050 10,400
Other operating income 6,780 7,441 8,375
Endowment income and interest receivable 903 654 684
Total income 96,262 101,463 106,104
Staff costs (55,987) (59,597) (60,843)
Other operating expenses (29,448) (30,501) (30,910)
Depreciation (4,115) (4,869) (4,842)
Total expenditure (89,550) (94,967) (96,595)
Transfer from accumulated income in endowment funds 24 126 290
Surplus for the year 6,736 6,622 9,799
Table 1: Income & Expenditure Account for the current and previous two years
The teaching grant from HEFCE fell by a further £2.0 million in 2014/15 to £9.3 million as an
increasing proportion of our tuition fees are paid by student loans. Research grant from HEFCE
also fell by £0.3 million to £9.8 million. These figures include an element of in-year reduction in
funding which will flow through to 2015/16. Looking forward, the outcome of the UK Government
Comprehensive Spending Review will be announced in November 2015. It is anticipated that this
will have a significant effect on the budget of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
although the impact on higher education is unknown. Contingencies have been included in the
2015/16 budget to help mitigate any cuts to funding.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
As the following table indicates, although part-time student numbers continue to fall, income
from this category remains stable. The continuing growth in our new full-time evening
undergraduate programmes coupled with a third cohort of students paying the higher
undergraduate fee, has increased our primary source of income. Income from tuition fees and
support grants represents 60.2% of total income (2013/14: 57%).

Although the increasing study intensity chosen by students has resulted in an increase in income
it has required only modest adjustments to our cost base this year and, therefore, an increased
surplus. The following charts summarise expenditure by activity.

Chart 2: Staff costs and other expenses by activity
The analysis of expenditure confirms that the College continues to invest heavily in education
and research with only 18% of total expenditure (excluding depreciation) spent on administration
and other central services. The year on year increase in administration and central services costs
of 3.8% is largely the result of further enhancements to student support.
A September 2015 Times Higher Education review of 2013/14 staff data submitted to the
Higher Education Statistics Agency indicated that Birkbeck had one of the lowest percentages of
support staff in the sector. 45% of staff at Birkbeck in 2013/14 were classified as support staff.
Across the sector, 111 out of 157 higher education institutions had the majority of their staff
providing support.
The surplus of 9.2% of turnover generated £11.2 million of cash from operating activities. This
helped to facilitate the purchase of a building for £15.4 million which will contribute to our
strategic objective to teach the majority of our students in space owned or jointly operated by the
College. Generating cash from operating activities is a core financial objective as it will allow the
College to continue to improve and expand infrastructure and the estate for the benefit of
teaching and research. As a charity, it is also important for the College to maintain a level of cash
to manage risk and uncertainty. Total cash reserves at the year end (excluding endowments and
long term investments) totalled £41.6 million (2013/14: £41.7 million).

Financial sustainability
The following table brings together some key pieces of financial data for the Group from the last
five years:
2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15
Total income (£’000) 88,614 93,606 96,262 101,463 106,104

Staff costs as a percentage of total
income 62.7% 58.5% 58.2% 58.7% 57.3%
Table 3: Key financial data 2010/11 to 2014/15
The key message that can be deduced from this table is that the College has a sound financial
basis on which it can plan and build for the future. Surpluses for the last five years have
exceeded 6.5% of total income which in turn has resulted in an increase in cash and current
asset investments of £14.8 million over the same period. £12.9 million (net after depreciation)
has also been reinvested in fixed assets since 2010/11 and the College has limited exposure to
long term loans (£48,000 at 31 July 2015).
A focus on strong financial management has kept costs in line with budget with staff costs as a
percentage of total income falling from 68.3% in 2009/10 to a more sustainable 57.3% in
2014/15. The College contributed £6.7 million, 6.3% of total income, (2013/14: £6.6 million,
6.5% of total income) to pension schemes by way of employer contributions, a figure which will
rise from April 2016. Triennial valuations from the two main pension schemes, SAUL and USS,
have confirmed that both funds have a deficit of assets compared to an estimate of future
liabilities. These increases will coincide with the introduction of an increase in the rate of
employer’s National Insurance contributions.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
HEFCE published a report titled Financial Health of the Higher Education Sector in March 2015
which considered a range of financial metrics based on the 2013/14 audited financial
statements of institutions. The following table compares Birkbeck’s position with sector
averages.
Birkbeck Sector
2013/14 average Variance
Operating surplus as a percentage of income 6.5% 3.9% +2.6%
Staff costs as a percentage of total income 58.7% 52.6% (6.1%)
Cash flow from operating activities as a percentage of
income 10.3% 8.4% +1.9%
Net liquidity days 169 122 +47
External borrowings as a percentage of income 0.0% 26.3% +26.3%
Table 4: Birkbeck comparison to sector
With the exception of the staff costs ratio, the comparison supports the statement that Birkbeck
is in a financially sustainable position. As a research intensive institution based in London with
no additional income from student residences, the College recognises the added importance of
managing this metric. As noted earlier, the percentage has fallen from 68.3% in 2009/10 and
the College has a target of not exceeding 60%.
Purchase of subsidiary
During the year the College purchased the freehold for a building on the Euston Road. The
building will be renovated to house scientific research or offices. Surveys are currently being
undertaken to determine whether the sensitive equipment used by the researchers can be
located in the building which has a close proximity to an underground line. In the event that this
is not possible, administrative activity will be relocated, thereby freeing space in the main
campus for development for teaching.
The building was previously owned by a special purpose company set up by a property developer.
The building was the only asset of the company. Having taken professional advice, the College
determined that purchasing the company was considered an appropriate mechanism to gain title
to the building. The Financial Statements provide data on the financial affairs of the College and
also the Group position after consolidating the new, wholly owned, subsidiary. The impact of the
purchase on the Balance Sheets can be summarised as follows:

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Risk Management
An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
internal control last year and will continue to do so.
The College Risk Register is compiled by the risk management group consisting of senior
academic and professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are
identified and evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The Risk Register is
considered by the Strategic Planning Committee and Audit Committee and approved by the
Governors. The risks are grouped by themes, for which Key Performance Indicators linked to
strategic objectives have been established. These will be monitored by Strategic Planning
Committee, Audit Committee and Governors.
The College continues to monitor adherence to risk management procedures and processes to
ensure that the Audit Committee and the Governors can be satisfied that risks are systematically
recognised, assessed and managed. An annual review of effectiveness of internal control and the
on-going identification and evaluation of significant risks is considered by the Strategic Planning
Committee and Audit Committee.
The top three risks identified for the College for 2015/16 and a summary of the mitigating
actions are as follows:
• Financial sustainability: one of the principal aims of our mission is to “provide flexible
higher education courses which meet the changing educational, cultural, personal and
career needs of adults; in particular those who live or work in the London region”. The
continuing fall in the number of part time students across the sector has created budget
uncertainty for the College for a number of years. Although we continue to lobby
government to act to stem this reduction, the success of the introduction of three year
full time undergraduate evening programmes has reduced the funding gap. Current
financial forecasts assume a degree of growth in full time undergraduate recruitments
but the removal of the Student Number Control in 2015/16 introduces a new
uncertainty. Student funding for postgraduate programmes is widely expected to
become more challenging for the sector once the first cohort of higher fee paying
undergraduates graduate at the end of 2014/15. Tuition fee income remains the core
element of our business and as such ensuring that we meet our targets will always be a
risk requiring significant effort. in response to current demand trends, the College has
scoped projects to improve and extend flexible evening study along with student and
learning support, enabling students to better combine work and study.
In the short term we will continue to ensure that expenditure is robustly controlled such
that forecast surpluses are maintained and reserves are enhanced to allow us to
develop our infrastructure and estate. Prudent budgets will continue to include
appropriate contingencies to help manage any income deficiencies and adjustments to
spend plans will be made in year where required. In the medium term, provision will be
expanded where there is demand and the academic portfolio will be flexibly developed
to remain distinctive and attractive to our students. Regular reports on financial

management and performance are presented to budget managers, the Strategic
Planning Committee and the Finance & General Purposes Committee along with a
basket of metrics to monitor performance.
• Student experience: a key supporting objective of our mission is to “ensure [that] the
College provides an inclusive working and learning environment for its students and
staff so that all may develop to their full potential.” There are a multitude of factors
which directly and indirectly contribute to a successful outcome for a student and
improving all these facets is challenging. The National Student Survey (NSS) and
metrics on retention, completion, achievement and employment provide vital data. The
NSS is currently being revised and a new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) which is
potentially linked to funding is being drafted by the government.
The College is contributing to the government consultation on the TEF to ensure that the
notion of students reaching their “full potential” is appropriately measured. The Pro-
Vice-Master for Learning and Teaching is overseeing a range of projects which aim to
dissect the range of student satisfaction metrics with a view to introducing
improvements and feedback is actively sought from students on a range of issues. The
role of the Students’ Union in representation is being developed with the support of the
Academic Registrar. A Student Engagement Strategy, drawing together services,
initiatives and projects to improve student support and advice, access,
communications, social engagement and career support will commence implementation
during 2015/16.
• Research standing: a principal aim of our mission is to “maintain and develop
excellence in research and provide the highest quality research training in all our
subject areas.” Retaining our reputation as a world class research intensive institution
is vital to our mission and is also a key aspect of why students choose to study with us
and excellent academic staff wish to join us. An updated research strategy was
approved in 2015 following publication of the Research Excellence Framework (REF)
results in 2014 and preparation is already under way for the next REF with a focus on
planning and leadership. The Pro-Vice-Master Research chairs regular meetings of a
REF working group and leads of units of assessment have been appointed with a role
description setting out responsibilities and expectations. Key Performance Indicators for
research have been established and will be monitored by the Research Committee and
as part of the overall KPI monitoring exercise by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit
Committee and Governors.
Despite the persistent challenge of recruiting students in an extremely competitive market and
the additional contributions we will need to make in respect of National Insurance and pensions,
our financial strategy for the future is based on annual surpluses of at least 5% of total income.
We believe that this is achievable, will allow us to invest in teaching and research and also
provide cash to invest in capital assets including our estate.
On behalf of the Governing Body, I would like to thank all staff for their dedication and support in
ensuring the success of Birkbeck and its unique mission as a research-led teaching institution
with a strong commitment to flexible patterns of teaching.

Public Benefit Statement
The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:
“The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Governing Body has
regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in
the following manner.
The College aims to provide higher education opportunities to people who would not otherwise
have access, continuing the mission since its inception. The College’s founder, George Birkbeck,
had a vision of the power of education to transform and improve lives, and this founding
commitment to social change and widening access is a core strand of what still drives the
College today. The College’s mission includes “enabling students from diverse social and
educational backgrounds to participate”. As London’s only specialist provider of flexible evening
higher education, Birkbeck has long encouraged applications from students without traditional
qualifications or from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds.
We attract a very high proportion of students with low incomes. 45% of our undergraduate
students were from households with an income of under £25,000, rising to 51% of full-time
students. These students received a Birkbeck bursary to support their study. The ethnicity of our
students demonstrates that we are attracting a very diverse student body, with 58% of our full-
time undergraduate students from BME backgrounds.
Birkbeck has long aimed to offer opportunities to mature students. Mature and part-time
students have been most affected by the increase in tuition fees in 2012, and are often
overlooked by the university sector. As part of our commitment to supporting mature students,
we have developed a free and impartial Information Advice and Guidance service, in partnership
with University of East London, where mature students are able to receive the support required to
make an informed decision. We also fund an innovative outreach programme of events to
engage mature students and we offer Certificates of Higher Education that offer a supportive and
lower risk entry to higher education to those without traditional entry qualifications. Birkbeck has
a long-standing agreement with Unionlearn to give employed people the opportunity to increase
their education level.
As well as the expenditure on financial support, we spend considerable amounts on ensuring that
our students are successful while they are with us, and that they are well placed in the jobs
market on graduation. Our evening provision uniquely enables students to combine study in the
evening with meaningful work during the day. In order to support students to gain paid and
meaningful job placements we have invested in our capacity to provide a particular type of
careers support and a new service to create job brokerage called Birkbeck Talent.

In February 2015, Pears Foundation agreed to provide £1.4 million of funding for the Pears
Institute for the Study of Antisemitism which is based at Birkbeck. The funding will run from
2015-2020 and represents an ongoing commitment from the Foundation to support the
research carried out by the Institute. Pears Foundation previously donated £1.5 million to
Birkbeck in 2010 which facilitated both the establishment of the Pears Institute for the Study of
Antisemitism and the relocation of the Wiener Library to the Birkbeck campus.
The Pears Institute is the only centre in the UK, and one of just two in Europe, whose mission is
to promote understanding of antisemitism. The Institute has gained an international reputation
for its innovative approach to the study of antisemitism and to exploring the connections
between antisemitism and other forms of racism and intolerance. The new funding supports the
Institute’s continued growth, with the creation of a new fully-funded post for a social sciences
lecturer, to extend the Institute’s teaching, and the continuation of the successful Pears Institute
Early Career Fellowship scheme.
The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded Birkbeck a three-year grant of $741,000 to cement
and expand a new model for open-access publishing in the humanities disciplines. The Open
Library of Humanities (OLH) platform, directed by Dr Martin Paul Eve and Dr Caroline Edwards -
both faculty members in Birkbeck's School of Arts - will allow access to peer-reviewed scholarly
journal articles without requiring readers to pay.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Unlike many emerging “gold” open-access models, the Open Library of Humanities does not
charge authors to publish. Instead, it is funded by an international library consortium whose
members recognise that the greatest benefit for the academy and society will only be realised
when access to scholarly work is not based on an exclusionary pay-to-read system. Since opening
for library partnerships earlier this year, over 80 institutions from around the world have already
signed up to support the platform financially, many pledging multi-year support upfront. The grant
will be used to build the sustainability model for the platform, to expand the number of journals
published by the OLH and to build open-source and free XML typesetting and translation
software.
The advancement of health or saving of lives
A £500,000 grant from MQ: Transforming Mental Health (a charity formed to support research
into mental health) has helped to fund a study led by scientists at Birkbeck to investigate
whether computer-based intervention can improve attention control in infants at familial risk of
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
The project will take a new approach to developing early interventions for ADHD, a condition
which affects up to 5% of the general population and can cause difficulties paying attention,
controlling behaviour and hyperactivity. The researchers will undertake a trial of computer-based
attention training for infants who are at increased risk for ADHD because they have an older
sibling or parent with the condition. The training approach uses state of the art technology to link
attention allocation to rewarding images on the screen. An eye tracker can tell exactly where an
infant is looking on a computer screen and infants can control what they will see next by where
they look. This approach has already been shown to strengthen concentration and attention in
typically developing infants. The researchers are interested in whether these effects can also be
seen in infants at risk for ADHD.
The prevention or relief of poverty
During the year, the College was accredited as a London Living Wage employer by the Living
Wage Foundation. The accreditation recognises the commitment of the College to paying staff –
whether they are permanent employees or third-party contractors and suppliers – the London
living wage.

STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE GOVERNORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
In accordance with the College’s Charter and Statutes, the Governors are responsible for
exercising the powers of the College. Governors have oversight of the College's affairs and are
responsible for ensuring effective administration, management and internal control. The
Governing Body is required to present audited financial statements for each financial year.
The Governors act as the trustees of the College and are responsible for ensuring that proper
accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the College; and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements are prepared
in accordance with the College’s Charter and Statutes, the Statement of Recommended Practice
on Accounting for Further and Higher Education and United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice. In addition, within the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of
Assurance and Accountability agreed between the Governors of the College and the Higher
Education Funding Council for England, the Governors, through the Master as designated office
holder, are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the College's state of affairs and of the surplus or deficit and cash flows for that year.
In causing the financial statements to be prepared, the Governors have ensured that:
 suitable accounting policies are selected and applied consistently;
 judgements and estimates are made that are reasonable and prudent;
 applicable accounting standards have been followed;
 financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the College will continue in operation; and
 they are satisfied that the College has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future (for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the
preparation of the financial statements).
The Governors have taken reasonable steps to:
 ensure that funds from the Higher Education Funding Council for England are used only for
the purposes for which they have been given and in accordance with the Memorandum of
Assurance and Accountability with the Funding Council and any other conditions which the
Funding Council may from time to time prescribe;
 ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to safeguard
public funds and funds from other sources;
 safeguard the assets of the College and prevent and detect fraud; and
 secure the economical, efficient and effective management of the College’s resources and
expenditure.
The key elements of the College’s system of internal financial control, which is designed to
discharge the responsibilities set out above, include the following:
 clear definitions of the responsibilities of, and the authority delegated to, Executive Deans,
School Managers, Assistant Deans and Directors of Professional Services;

STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE GOVERNORS' RESPONSIBILITIES (continued)
 a comprehensive medium and short-term planning process, supplemented by detailed
annual income, expenditure, capital and cash flow budgets and forecasts;
 regular reviews of key performance indicators and business, operational, compliance and
sustainability risks and reports of variance from the annual income and expenditure
budget;
 clearly defined and formalised requirements for approval and control of expenditure, with
investment decisions involving capital or revenue expenditure being subject to formal
detailed appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the Governors;
 comprehensive Financial Regulations, detailing financial controls and procedures,
approved by the Audit Committee and Finance and General Purposes Committee; and
 a professional Internal Audit Service whose annual programme is approved by the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee receives reports on internal audit activity within the
College. The Chair of Audit Committee provides the Governors with reports on internal
audit activity and an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the College's system
of internal control, including internal financial control.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Corporate governance and accountability arrangements
Birkbeck College is a body incorporated by Royal Charter. Although the College does not have
shareholders, and is not a listed company, the Governing Body is committed to achieving high
standards of corporate governance, in line with accepted best practice. This summary describes
the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (2014) insofar as they relate to universities. Its purpose is to help
the reader of the accounts understand how the principles have been applied.
The Governing Body
The Governing Body (“Governors”) comprises lay members, students, alumni and employees
appointed under the Statutes of the College, the majority of whom are non-executive. There is a
majority of lay members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the Governing Body are
separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.
The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and
Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities and under the
Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability with the Higher Education Funding Council for
England. The Governing Body is responsible for the ongoing strategic direction of the College,
approval of major developments and the receipt of regular reports from Senior Management on
the day to day operations of its business.
The Governing Body is responsible for the College's system of internal control and for reviewing
its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including
Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and
Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of
reference. All lay members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the Governors
on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.
The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE
and the Committee for University Chairs for regular effectiveness reviews. The review concluded
that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in place
measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more
opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings.
The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of
Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. It will
keep under review its effectiveness and continue to seek to enhance governance processes and
practices in line with the provisions of the Code. It has approved a set of Key Performance
Indicators linked to College strategic objectives and will consider what target KPIs to set in
2015/16.
The Governing Body is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the College's significant risks, linked to the achievement of strategic objectives, that
the process has been in place for the year ended 31 July 2015 and up to the date of approval of
the annual accounts, that it is regularly reviewed by the Governing Body and that it accords with
the internal control guidance for directors in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2014) and the
principles in the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee
On all academic matters the Governors must consider, but not necessarily follow, the advice of
the Academic Board, which is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the
College. The Academic Board has a membership of around 150 drawn almost entirely from
academic staff and the students of the College and chaired by the Master. It delegates some of
its powers to its Executive Committee.
Finance and General Purposes Committee
The Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&GPC) reviews and then recommends to the
Governors the College’s annual revenue and capital budgets and monitors performance in
relation to the approved budgets. It reviews and then recommends to Governors the financial
regulations and financial policies that are applied to management. It reviews the annual financial
statements and considers financial strategy. In addition, the Investment Committee is
responsible for the College investments on behalf of F&GPC.
The Finance and General Purposes Committee met three times during the year.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee considers nominations for lay member vacancies in the Governing
Body membership under the relevant Statute and for Governing Body appointed vacancies on
College Committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into account the balance of skills,
knowledge and experience of members and are based on assessment against objective criteria.
It also considers issues of succession planning and diversity within the Governing Body.
The Nominations Committee met once during the year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines the annual remuneration of the Master and of
professorial and senior administrative staff. Lay members of Governing Body receive no
remuneration for their services although expenses incurred in attending meetings are met by the
College. Members of the Governing Body who are employees of the College receive no additional
remuneration for their services to the Governing Body. The cost of living salary increases for all
staff are determined by national pay negotiations for all universities. The employee members
have no involvement in determining their own salaries.
The Remuneration Committee met once during the year.
Equalities Committee
The Equalities Committee promotes equality and diversity among staff and students across the
College by:
 monitoring College policy on equal opportunities and diversity, recommending the
introduction of new policy as appropriate and issuing guidelines on new initiatives;
 monitoring developments in legislation and making recommendations for any necessary
changes required to policy and practice;
 developing and ensuring implementation of the College’s Single Equality Strategy and other
related policies.
The Committee makes an annual report on equal opportunities monitoring and developments in
equality and diversity to the Governors.
The Committee met twice during the year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises wholly lay members drawn from the Governing Body plus a co-
opted member and so has no executive responsibility. Members have recent, relevant financial
and other appropriate experience. The Audit Committee met four times during the year.
The Audit Committee relies substantially on the work of the internal and external auditors, on the
information provided by management and the response of management to the questions it
raises.
The remit of the Audit Committee includes:
 reviewing the effectiveness of the College’s systems of internal control and risk
management;
 satisfying itself and assuring the Governors that satisfactory arrangements are in place to
promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness thereby securing value for money;
 reviewing and approving the remit of the internal audit function;
 advising the Governors, as necessary, on the appointment and remuneration of the
internal and external auditors, and their quality, reliability and effectiveness;
 reviewing with the external auditors the scope and nature of the audit, including the
report to Audit Committee written by the external auditors; and
 assessing compliance with the regulatory framework relating to audit issues.
The external and internal auditors have a standing arrangement to meet with the Audit
Committee regularly without senior officers present. The auditors also attend meetings with
senior officers to consider the items listed above, and to review plans for the audit process.
The College’s internal audit function provides, by undertaking review, independent objective
assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk
management framework, and the design and effectiveness of the operation of internal controls
that are intended to control critical business application risks. Internal audit also helps the
College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating
and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by
working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by
internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews
are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate
action confirmed to the Audit Committee. The head of the internal audit has unfettered access to
the Audit Committee.
The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports regularly thereon to the
Audit Committee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
Audit Committee (continued)
The senior management team and the Audit Committee receive regular reports, including value
for money reports, from internal audit which include recommendations for improvement. The
Audit Committee's role in this area is to carry out a high level review of the arrangements for
internal financial control. The Audit Committee and the Strategic Planning Committee review risk
and control during the annual compilation of the risk register and report to the Governing Body.
The Audit Committee also reports on the effectiveness of the College’s management of risks to
the Governing Body each term. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance
and not merely reporting by exception. At its summer 2015 meeting, the Governing Body
approved the risk management report for 2014/15 and the risk register for 2015/16, taking into
account reports from College management and the Audit Committee. In November 2015 the
Governing Body considered and approved the annual report of the Audit Committee on its work
during 2014/15, including a report from the internal auditor.
Strategic Planning Committee
The Strategic Planning Committee consists of College officers with strategic management
responsibility. Its remit is to consider College-wide strategic issues and priorities and to advise
Finance and General Purposes Committee and Governors accordingly. It is responsible for
internal planning and resource allocation policy and procedures. It oversees the annual planning
and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and professional services on developing plans
and co-ordinates and integrates plans for presentation to Finance and General Purposes
Committee. The Committee has established and regularly monitors Key Performance Indicators
that measure performance against the objectives set. It is also responsible for fee levels and
scholarship policy and advises Finance and General Purposes Committee and Governors
accordingly.
The Strategic Planning Committee met six times during the year.
The membership of all of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 1-4.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK COLLEGE
AND GROUP
We have audited the Group and College financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of
Birkbeck College for the year ended 31 July 2015 which comprise the Consolidated Income and
Expenditure Account, the Group and College Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Accounting Policies and the
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Governing Body, in accordance with the Charters and Statutes of
the College. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Governing Body
those matters we are required to state to it in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the Governing Body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of the Governing Body and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of the College Governors’ Responsibilities set out on
pages 24 and 25 the Governing Body is responsible for the preparation of financial statements
which give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion, on the
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and College’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the Governing Body; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Operating
and Financial Review to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If
we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Group and the College as at 31
July 2015 and of the Group’s income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and
cash flows for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice –
Accounting for Further and Higher Education.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK COLLEGE
AND GROUP
Opinion on other matters prescribed in the HEFCE Audit Code of Practice issued under the
Further and Higher Education Act 1992
In our opinion, in all material respects:
 funds from whatever source administered by the University for specific purposes have
been properly applied to those purposes; and
 funds provided by HEFCE have been applied in accordance with the Memorandum of
Assurance and Accountability and any other terms and conditions attached to them.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matter where the HEFCE Audit Code of
Practice issued under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion, the statement of internal control included as part of the Corporate Governance
Statement is inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and the College.

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the statement of
recommended practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education and in accordance
with applicable Accounting Standards.
Basis of accounting
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention modified by the
revaluation of certain fixed assets and investments. Governors having regard to the College’s
overall financial position including cash flows and reserves, consider it appropriate that the
financial statements be prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the College and its wholly owned subsidiary. Any
intra group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
In accordance with FRS2, the activities of the student union have not been consolidated into the
Financial Statements because the College does not exercise significant influence or control over
those activities.
Recognition of income
Income from research grants, contracts and other services rendered is included to the extent of
completion of the contract or service concerned when it is measurable and when there is
certainty of receipt. This is generally equivalent to the sum of the relevant expenditure incurred
during the year and any related contributions towards overhead costs. All income from short-term
deposits is credited to the income and expenditure account in the period in which it is earned.
Income from specific endowments is included when it is earned. Income from donations is
recognised when it is received.
Recurrent grants from the Funding Council are recognised in the period in which they are
receivable.
Non-recurrent grants from the Funding Council or other bodies received in respect of the
acquisition or construction of fixed assets are treated as deferred capital grants and amortised in
line with depreciation over the life of the assets.
Income from academic fees is recognised in the period for which it is receivable and includes all
fees payable by students or their sponsors.
Pension schemes
Retirements benefits for most employees of the College are provided by the Universities
Superannuation Scheme (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of
London (SAUL). These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted
out of the State Second Pension Scheme. The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee
administered funds. Contributions to the schemes are determined by qualified actuaries on the
basis of triennial valuations using the Projected Unit Method. Reviews of the scheme positions
are carried out in the period between valuations.
It is not possible to identify the College's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the
schemes. Therefore contributions are accounted for as if the schemes were defined contribution
schemes and pension costs are based on the contributions payable in the year. Differences
between contributions payable and contributions paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments on the balance sheet.

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Leased assets
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to expenditure in equal annual amounts over
the periods of the leases. The College does not hold any finance leases.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at
the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at year end rates. The resulting exchange differences are dealt with in
the determination of income and expenditure for the financial year.
Tangible fixed assets
a. Land and buildings
Freehold buildings are stated at cost and depreciated over 50 years. Long leasehold
buildings are stated at cost and depreciated over the period of the lease.
Assets under the course of construction are capitalised to the extent the work is complete
as at 31 July. On completion the assets are transferred to the appropriate categories and
are depreciated according to the depreciation policy for that category.
Where buildings are acquired with the aid of specific grants or donations they are
capitalised and depreciated over the expected useful life of the buildings. The related
grants or donations are treated as deferred capital grants and released to income over
the same period.
b. Refurbishments
Expenditure on major refurbishment projects is capitalised and depreciated over 5 to 20
years based on useful economic life.
c. Equipment
Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is written-off to the Income and
Expenditure Account in the year of acquisition. All other equipment is capitalised at cost.
Capitalised equipment is depreciated over its useful economic life as follows:
Computer equipment - 3 years
Other general equipment - 5 years
Equipment acquired for research or other projects - project life
Where equipment is acquired with the aid of specific grants it is capitalised and
depreciated in accordance with the above policy. The related grant is credited to a
deferred capital grant account and released to the Income and Expenditure Account over
the same period as depreciation is charged.

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Investments
The College investment in the wholly owned subsidiary is stated at original cost. Other
investments that form part of Fixed Assets and Endowment Assets are listed on a recognised
stock exchange and included in the Balance Sheet at market value.
Current Asset Investments are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of their original cost
and net realisable value.
Accounting for charitable donations
a. Unrestricted donations
Charitable donations are recognised in the accounts when the charitable donation has
been received or if, before receipt, there is sufficient evidence to provide the necessary
certainty that the donation will be received and the value of the incoming resources can
be measured with sufficient reliability.
b. Endowment funds
Where charitable donations are to be retained for the benefit of the institution as
specified by the donors, these are accounted for as endowments. There are three main
types:
1. Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund
is to be permanently invested to generate an income stream for the general
benefit of the institution;
2. Restricted expendable endowments - the donor has specified a particular
objective other than the purchase or construction of tangible fixed assets and
the institution can convert the donated sum into income;
3. Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is
to be permanently invested to generate an income stream to be applied to a
particular objective.
c. Donations for fixed assets
Donations received to be applied to the cost of a tangible fixed asset are shown on the
balance sheet as a deferred capital grant. The deferred capital grant is released to the
Income and Expenditure Account over the same estimated useful life that is used to
determine the depreciation charge associated with the tangible fixed asset.
Stocks
Stocks for re-sale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Maintenance of premises
The College has a five-year rolling long-term maintenance plan which forms part of the ongoing
maintenance of the estate. The cost of long-term and routine corrective maintenance is charged
to the Income and Expenditure Account as it is incurred.

Liquid resources
Liquid resources include sums on short-term deposits with recognised banks and building
societies.
Taxation status
The College is considered to pass the tests set out in Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 of the Finance Act
2010 and therefore it meets the definition of a charitable company for UK Corporation Tax
purposes. Accordingly, the College is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or
capital gains received within categories covered by Chapter 3 Part 11 of the Corporation Tax Act
2010 or Section 256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such
income or gains are applied exclusively to charitable purposes.
The College is partially exempt in respect of Value Added Tax so that it can only recover a minor
element of VAT charged on its inputs. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is included in the costs of such
inputs and added to the cost of tangible fixed assets as appropriate, where the inputs
themselves are tangible fixed assets by nature.
The wholly owned subsidiary company is registered for VAT and is subject to UK Corporation Tax
and VAT in the same way as any commercial organisation. The subsidiary and the College have
not formed a VAT group.

A Contingent Asset exists if an economic benefit may arise from a past event. The College intends to make a claim to
HMRC for Research and Development Tax Credits for possible qualifying expenditure for the financial years 2013/14
and 2014/15. The amounts were not known at the time the Financial Statements were produced.
With the exception of separate trustee administered pension funds the College had no Contingent Liabilities at either
31 July 2015 or 31 July 2014. The College is unable to separately identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the funds
and accounts for them as if they were defined contribution schemes. Note 23 Pension Schemes provides further information.

23. PENSION SCHEMES
Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
Birkbeck, University of London participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a defined benefit scheme
which is contracted out of the State Second Pension (S2P). The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-
administered fund. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the scheme's assets are not hypothecated to
individual institutions and a scheme wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore exposed to actuarial
risks associated with other institutions' employees and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS17, accounts for the
scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure
account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Contingent Liabilities and Assets
A contingent liability exists in relation to the pension valuation recovery plan, since the company is an employer of
members within the scheme. The contingent liability relates to the amount generated by past service of current members
and the associated proportion of the deficit. Given that the scheme is a multi‐employer scheme and the company is unable
to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities, the contingent liability is not recognised as a provision
on the balance sheet. The associated receivable from the scheme in respect of the reimbursement of the company’s
expenditure is similarly not recognised.
Pension costs
The company participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a defined benefit scheme which is
contracted out of the State Second Pension (S2P). The assets of the scheme are held in a separate fund administered
by the trustee, Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited. The company is required to contribute a specified
percentage of payroll costs to the pension scheme to fund the benefits payable to the company’s employees. In 2015,
the percentage was 16% (2014: 16%). The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 “Retirement
benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The total cost charged to the income and expenditure account is shown at the foot of this note. There was neither
a prepayment nor an accrual at the end of the financial year in respect of these contributions. The disclosures below
represent the position from the scheme’s financial statements. The latest available triennial actuarial valuation of the
scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation date”), which was carried out using the projected unit method and is
currently being audited by the scheme auditor. Based on this 2014 valuation it is expected that employer contributions
will increase to 18% from 1 April 2016.
The 2014 valuation was the third valuation for USS under the scheme‐specific funding regime introduced by the
Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and
appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme
was £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion indicating a shortfall of
£5.3 billion. The assets therefore were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had accrued to members
after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
FRS 17 liability numbers have been produced using the following assumptions:
2015 2014
Discount Rate 3.3% 4.5%
Pensionable salary growth 3.5% in the first year and 4.4%
4.0% thereafter
Price inflation (CPI) 2.2% 2.6%

The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. Mortality in retirement is assumed
to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S1NA tables as follows:
Male members’ mortality S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – No age rating
Female members’ mortality S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – rated down 1 year
Use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience. To allow for further improvements
in mortality rates the CMI 2009 projections with a 1.25% pa long term rate were also adopted for the 2014 FRS17
figures, for the March 2015 figures the long term rate has been increased to 1.5% and the CMI 2014 projections
adopted, and the tables have been weighted by 98% for males and 99% for females.
The current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are: 2015 2014
Males currently aged 65 (years) 24.2 23.7
Females currently aged 65 (years) 26.3 25.6
Males currently aged 45 (years) 26.2 25.5
Females currently aged 45 (years) 28.6 27.6

SAUL
Birkbeck, University of London participates in the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London ( "SAUL"),
which is a centralised defined benefit scheme and is contracted-out of the Second State Pension. SAUL is a "last
man standing" scheme so that in the event of the insolvency of any of the participating employers in SAUL, the
amount of any pension funding shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer will be
spread across the remaining participant employers and reflected in the next actuarial valuation. A formal valuation
of SAUL is carried out every three years by professionally qualified and independent actuaries using the Projected Unit
method. Informal reviews of SAUL's position are carried out between formal valuations.
The College participates in a centralised defined benefit scheme for all qualified employees with the assets held in
separate Trustee-administered funds. The College has now adopted FSR17 for accounting for pension costs. It
is not possible to identify the College's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL. Therefore contributions
are accounted for as if SAUL were a defined contribution scheme and pension costs are based on the amounts
actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs 8 - 12 of FRS17.
SAUL is subject to triennial valuations by professional qualified and independent actuaries. The last available
valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2011 using the projected unit credit method in which the actuarial liability
makes allowance for projected earnings.
The main assumptions used to assess the technical provisions were:
31 March 2011
Discount rate
- pre-retirement 6.80% p.a.
- post-retirement 4.70% p.a.
General* Salary Increases 3.75% p.a. until 31 March 2014, 4.50% p.a.
thereafter
Retail Prices Index Inflation ("RPI") 3.50% p.a.
Consumer Price Index Inflation ("CPI") 2.80% p.a.
Pension Increases in payment 2.80% p.a.
(excess over GMP)
Mortality - base table SAPS Normal (year of birth) tables with an
age rating of +0.5 years for males and
-0.4 years for females.
Mortality - future improvements Future improvements in line with CMI 2010
projections with a long term trend of
1.25% p.a.
*an additional allowance is made for promotional salary increases

The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and does not identify surpluses or deficits applicable to
individual employers. As a whole, the market value of SAUL's assets was £1,506 million representing
95% of the liability for benefits after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
Based on the strength of the Employer covenant and the Trustee's long-term investment strategy, the
Trustee and the Employers agreed to maintain Employer and Member contributions at 13% of Salaries
and 6% of Salaries respectively following the valuation. The above rates will be reviewed when the results
of the next formal valuation (as at 31 March 2014) are known.
A comparison of SAUL's assets and liabilities calculated using assumptions consistent with FRS17
revealed SAUL to be in deficit at the last formal valuation date (31 March 2011). As part of this valuation,
the Trustee and Employer have agreed that no additional contributions will be required to eliminate the
current shortfall.
The more material changes (the introduction of a Career Average Revalued Earnings, or "CARE", benefit
structure) to SAUL's benefit structure will apply from 1 July 2012. As a consequence, the cost of benefit
accrual is expected to fall as existing final salary members are replaced by new members joining the
CARE structure. This will allow an increasing proportion of the expected asset return to be used to
eliminate the funding shortfall. Based on conditions as at 31 March 2011, the shortfall is expected to be
eliminated by 31 March 2021, which is 10 years from the valuation date.
The total pension cost for the College was: 2015 2014
£000 £000
Contributions to USS 5,672 5,601
Contributions to SAUL 1,072 9 91
Total Pension Cost (Note 6) 6,744 6,592
