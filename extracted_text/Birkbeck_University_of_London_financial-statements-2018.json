Our teaching takes place in\n          the evening with a consequence that most of our students are mature and have jobs, caring or\n          other responsibilities during the day. We have a heritage as a specialist provider of part-time\n          education; however, with the advent of the ELQ policy and the 2012 funding changes, we have\n          seen significant shifts in our student profile. Our part-time undergraduate population has\n          contracted by over 60% in line with much of the sector. The launch of our full-time degrees from\n          2010 compensated for this decline and the College now has around 2,900 full time equivalent\n          (FTE) full-time undergraduates (from around zero in 2009) and 2,900 FTE part-time\n          undergraduates (source: HESA 2016). During this transition the College remained true to its\n          mission with teaching still taking place in the evening and access being available to all. 25% of\n          part-time entrants at Birkbeck had either level 2 (equivalent to GCSE) or lower entry qualifications\n          in 2016/17 and 83% of full-time entrants had low tariff or non-tariffable qualifications (source:\n          Birkbeck TEF2 metrics). 42% of full-time students had a household income of under £25,000\n          and 64% of part-time students had a household income of under £40,000 (source: applications\n          for Birkbeck bursary scheme 2017/18).                                   \n          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since\n          2010, the College made a deficit of £0,5 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off\n          equipment grant) and is budgeting for an underlying deficit again in 2018/19. The main cause of\n          this was a significant fall in EU students in 2017/18: we recruited 300 headcount fewer EU\n          students in 2017/18 than in 2016/17. This effect is largely limited to EU students already living\n          in London whilst we have seen an increase in demand from EU students living on the continent.\n          We believe that this is a direct result of Brexit related uncertainty over employment and\n          residency.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The introduction of the postgraduate loan in 2016/17 saw an increase of 34% in recruitment of\n          new Masters students at Birkbeck compared with 19% in England as a whole. Our model enables\n          people who are already in work to study without giving up their job and the loan has proved to be\n          an enabler for this market. This growth position was largely consolidated in 2017/18. The UK\n          Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) has forecast that the number of Londoners\n          qualified with ‘Other higher degree’ (mainly Masters) will increase by a third by 2022 and the\n          population of London qualified with a First Degree – i.e. the potential market for Masters - is\n          projected to increase by 13%. Postgraduate programmes will remain a key focus for our\n          recruitment strategy.                                                   \n          In addition to this, we launched a Degree with Foundation Year in 2017/18. Despite being\n          launched part-way through the admissions cycle we recruited 163 students into the first cohort\n          and anticipate growth as all four cohorts are filled. We will extend the Degree with Foundation\n          Year offering across all five Schools in 2018/19.                       \n                                                                                  \n          Since 2010/11 international undergraduate students at Birkbeck have increased from near zero\n          to a 0.5% share of the London market. This is still well below our share of the total London full-\n          time undergraduate market at 1.3%. In 2017/18, international postgraduate students at\n          Birkbeck increased by 15% to 300 FTE. This is as a result of carefully targeted marketing efforts\n          including tactical use of scholarship schemes. We also invested further in the international\n          marketing team to increase recruitment from our most promising markets. Birkbeck is a major\n          provider of Masters programmes to the Home-EU market being the 6th largest provider by\n          headcount in the UK equating to 2.2% of the London market. By contrast, we have 1% of the\n          equivalent market for international students.

Cumulatively the goal is to ensure that we keep true to our unique mission and\n          look and perform at a level in keeping with our reputation for excellence.\n                                                                                  \n          Crucial strands of this strategy are:                                   \n                                                                                  \n                •  Student experience review implementation, ensuring that our diverse student body\n                   is properly supported to succeed resulting in strong NSS and TEF outcomes;\n                •  Estates strategy for expansion and modernisation of the estate, addressing\n                   longstanding issues about teaching space and delivering appropriate research\n                   facilities;                                                    \n                •  Improved research support infrastructure to cement our place in the top tranche of\n                   research intensive institutions at the REF.                    \n                                                                                  \n          Financially, tuition fee income is and will remain our key income stream and due to our mode and\n          mission we are far more dependent on tuition fee income than most of our peers with it\n          representing over 60% of our turnover. To deliver this strategy we need to return as quickly as\n          possible to a student body of around 10,500 FTE. In 2017/18 our student body totalled 8,815\n          FTE compared to 9,164 FTE in 2016/17. Recruitment in 2018/19 looks more positive than in\n          2017/18 but on forecast rates of student number growth it will take us at least another year to\n          recover the lost numbers, with several years further expansion beyond that needed to deliver the\n          level of student recruitment needed to ensure financial sustainability. \n                                                                                  \n          None of our three key institutional goals are self-funding. All require upfront investment and the\n          primary gains are in terms of depth and quality and in moving the experience of students and\n          staff on to a par with the comparator institutions against which we benchmark ourselves. Whilst\n          in the long term there will be financial gains - directly through improved retention and research\n          funding and indirectly as a result of reputational impact – these will not be at a level that in and\n          of itself sustains a higher equilibrium.                                \n          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with\n          turnover of £100 to 250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we\n          are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost\n          pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode and student\n          body adds major complexity and inflexibility to our underlying business model. Provision at the\n          heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue other\n          activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity into 15 hours a\n          week in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be\n          addressed.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          More fundamentally, in addition to tuition fee and income, our benchmark competitors currently\n          have significant additional income streams, primarily through campus/facility related income and\n          through knowledge transfer/spin off/commercialisation activities. As we have neither residences\n          nor a science park/innovation hub, we lack these income streams.        \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

Whilst growth based on our existing portfolio is\n          an important part of any recovery plan we also need to spread risk by investing in growth across\n          a range of initiatives.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          To do so, we have looked back to our unique mission and unrivalled location and attempted to\n          turn them to our advantage rather than see them solely as drivers of increased cost and\n          complexity. As an institution embedded in the social fabric of a metropolis we are seeking to\n          generate additional activity and income streams aligned with the needs of London’s culture,\n          economy and society.                                                    \n          In tandem with developing additional income streams and increasing student numbers we must\n          also closely manage our staff cost base. We are committed to maintaining promotion and\n          recruitment processes which develop and reward talent. We are also making interventions in\n          relation to our equalities and diversity strategy and looking to integrate and support teaching and\n          scholarship staff who are currently on sessional contracts (some on an open-ended basis as part\n          of an ongoing role, others in response to specific and non-recurrent needs). In this context the\n          adoption of an expectations and workload framework for academic staff, alongside compulsory\n          appraisal/review, is a significant development which enables us to ensure that we are using our\n          resources effectively.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The issues of complexity, and the incremental layering of new activities onto pre-existing\n          structures as the College has sought to rapidly adapt, identified in relation to teaching is also true\n          for the College’s professional and support services and School-based administrations. Whilst\n          elements of this have been and are being tackled with focused reviews of specific processes,\n          the current situation requires a more holistic externally supported review that focuses\n          additionally on organisation, capacity, capability and resource that will inform service planning\n          and delivery in this new climate. Cumulatively both the development trajectory we are proposing,\n          and these initiatives, do constitute a significant level of organisational change.\n                                                                                  \n          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George\n          Birkbeck set out his vision:                                            \n               ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’\n                                                                                  \n          This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,\n          work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer\n          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,\n          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. Within an increasingly volatile\n          operating environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and\n          contribution to science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all\n          of our activities.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

It is pleasing to be able to report that\n          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various\n          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards received during\n          the year.                                                               \n          Martin Paul Eve, Professor of Literature, Technology and Publishing at Birkbeck, has been\n          awarded the Medal of Honour in the Humanities and Social Sciences by KU Leuven in Belgium.\n          The Medal of Honour is awarded to laureates of exceptional academic or social distinction who\n          make a unique contribution to the mutual relationship between faculties and universities.\n          Professor Eve is known for his higher education policy work around open access (OA) in addition\n          to his research interests in contemporary American fiction, histories and philosophies of\n          technology, and technological mutations in scholarly publishing. Professor Eve is one of the\n          founding directors (together with Dr Caroline Edwards) of the Open Library of Humanities (OLH) -\n          a non-profit publisher devoted to OA run by academics. He is also currently leading a major\n          project into the peer review process, analysing its role in the research cycle to develop better\n          ways of using expert opinion to assess and improve published research.  \n                                                                                  \n          Two Birkbeck academics won awards for their books: Dr Matthew Champion won the Gladstone\n          Prize, for his book The Fullness of Time: Temporalities of the Fifteenth-Century Low Countries and\n          Professor Frank Trentmann was awarded the 2018 Austrian Science Prize for the best book in\n          the humanities, social sciences and cultural studies for Herrschaft Der Dinge, the German edition\n          of his title Empire of Things. The Gladstone prize is awarded by the Royal Historical Society to a\n          solely written first book published in the UK on a historical subject which is not primarily about\n          British history. The Austrian Science Prize was launched in 2007 by the Austrian Ministry of\n          Education, Science and Research to recognise excellence in non-fiction writing. Professor\n          Trentmann’s book was shortlisted for its category by a jury of experts and won following a public\n          vote across bookshops, libraries and on the prize’s website.            \n                                                                                  \n          Laura Mulvey, Professor of Film in the Department of Film, Media and Cultural Studies, was given\n          an honorary degree from Yale University. The award was made at a ceremony attended by\n          10,000 people where Professor Mulvey was described as one of the great figures in the history of\n          film theory. Her citation went on to say: “Lauded for her influential role in developing the field of\n          feminist film theory, she has inspired generations of scholars at Yale and around the world.”\n          Dr Sue Brooks from Birkbeck’s Department of Geography won the Geographical Association (GA)\n          Award for Excellence in Leading Geography. The award was voted on by members of the GA and\n          given to the author of the article in each of the GA’s journals that is felt to have made the most\n          significant contribution to geographical teaching and learning. Her selected paper, Coastal\n          resilience and vulnerability: storm impacts, extreme weather and regional variability in the UK,\n          winter 2013–14, looked at the high-magnitude storms and the impact they caused in the west\n          and south-west of the UK over the winter of 2013-14. A statement from the GA noted that the\n          article “highlights how new technologies are being used to quantify some of the key coastal\n          impacts of such events.” The Geographical Association is a national organisation with over 5,000\n          members and is devoted to the dissemination of good practice in delivering the geography\n          curriculum to schools.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Bill Bowring, Professor of Law, was conferred as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences\n          (AcSS), alongside 68 other leading social scientists. Professor Bowring is Director of the LLM/MA\n          in Human Rights at Birkbeck and a leading expert in the UK on legal and human rights issues in\n          Russia and the countries of the Former Soviet Union, and Eastern and Central Europe.

The British Academy is a community of over 1,400 of the leading minds that\n          make up the UK’s national academy for the humanities and social sciences. Professor Lynda\n          Nead, Pevsner Chair of History of Art at Birkbeck, was made a Fellow of the Academy. They join a\n          number of other members of College staff including Professor Joanna Bourke, Professor Marina\n          Warner and Professor Mark Johnson.                                      \n          Estates                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary space,\n          to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to improve research\n          facilities. Governors have approved the College Estate Strategy which determined that four\n          projects were required to improve the quality of our research and teaching space and also to\n          increase the amount of teaching space that was under the direct, or shared, control of the\n          College.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n          A governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards\n          (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design teams,\n          senior College staff and independent Governors) which feed in to Estates Committee (a sub-\n          committee of Finance & General Purposes Committee). The structure aims to ensure that all\n          aspects of each project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is\n          obtained, the building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on\n          major projects are also provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee to provide assurance\n          that all risks are being appropriately managed.                         \n                                                                                  \n          For the past twenty years, the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development’s (CBCD) BabyLab has\n          been investigating the psychological processes in infants’ brains and they have uncovered major\n          insights into child development. The BabyLab scientists have identified the earliest marker of\n          autism in babies, examined the links between Down’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease and\n          investigated the effects of screen time on babies as young as six-months-old. The first project to\n          commence construction is a purpose built ToddlerLab to extend the research of CBCD to older\n          children. Costing over £11 million the building project has received generous donations from the\n          Wohl Foundation and the Woolfson Foundation.                            \n          The ToddlerLab will be equipped with sophisticated wireless technology which allows toddlers to\n          be toddlers while tracking their brain activity and monitoring their behaviour. An example of the\n          cutting-edge technology is a virtual environment known as the “CAVE” which simulates real-world\n          surroundings, such as a farm or a supermarket, and monitors how toddlers’ brain activity\n          changes depending on the world around them. The CAVE and other equipment in the building\n          has been supported by an innovative crowdfunding campaign, a significant donation from an\n          alumnus of the College and an equipment grant from the Wellcome Trust. The ToddlerLab is\n          scheduled to open in 2019/20.                                           \n                                                                                  \n          In April 2018 the College received planning permission from the London Borough of Camden to\n          renovate and extend a 1920’s building, called Cambridge House, on Euston Road. London-based\n          architect, Penoyre & Prasad, added a copper-clad two-storey lecture theatre to the top of the\n          existing structure to create a flexible and high quality teaching space. The plans will also include\n          a café and active learning space on the ground floor with a basement and teaching classrooms\n          on the upper floors. The building will add around 440 square metres of additional teaching space\n                                      Page 12",

In\n          the education sector as a whole, the median gender pay gap was reported at 20%.\n                                                                                  \n          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in\n          favour of men; there are 6.2% fewer women in the highest paid quartile and 11.6% more women\n          in the lowest paid quartile. This clustering of men and women at different levels of an\n          organisation, referred to as a vertical pay gap, is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector,\n          although less pronounced at Birkbeck. The population distribution is a significant factor in the\n          overall gender pay gap. The College monitors the diversity of population changes through\n          promotion, recruitment and exit. Targeted actions from previous pay reviews and other gender\n          analysis activities, such as Athena SWAN, have been identified and put in place to address\n          population imbalances. For example, the academic promotion schemes were modified and this\n          has resulted in an increased application and promotion rate of women to more senior academic\n          roles.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 13",

Facility Time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the\n          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when\n          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open\n          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown on the\n          next page.                                                              \n                                      Page 14",

These volunteers play an\n          important role in aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives.\n          During 2018 new General Data Protection Regulations came into effect. Birkbeck exists to\n          provide life changing educational opportunities for its students and undertake cutting-edge\n          research for the public good. In order to carry out this mission, it is necessary to process personal\n          data. We invested significant time to ensure that we process data transparently, fairly, lawfully,\n          safely and securely. We renewed our policies to strengthen our commitment and processes\n          around data privacy.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          As we move towards our 200th anniversary in 2023, our alumni and supporters will be vital in\n          helping us to achieve our ambitious strategic priorities. Over the coming year we will broaden our\n          fundraising activity; deepen our relationships with current supporters and attract new donors to\n          support these ambitions.                                                \n                                                                                  \n          Despite a very strong performance in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the award\n          of a Silver grade in the 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) and strong financial\n          performance over a number of years we were disappointed to find that EU student recruitment\n          fell following the Brexit referendum and for the first time since 2009 the College posted a deficit\n          (after adjusting for one-off equipment grants). Although there are an unprecedented number of\n          significant uncertainties in the higher education sector at the moment the external reviews (TEF\n          and REF) validate our strategic objective to deliver high quality teaching and research. As we\n          enter a period of recovery we are still confidently defining our ambitions and vision for Birkbeck\n          in its third century.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Professor David S.

Teaching grant fell by a further £0.6 million in\n          2017/18 (a reduction of 10.0% year-on-year). Teaching grant now represents only 5.5% of\n          College income in comparison with 47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees\n          has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to 60.7% in 2017/18 (although this is down by £1.4 million on\n          2016/17).                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          Income from research grants and contracts is slightly skewed this year due to the recognition as\n          income of a non-government funded equipment grant of £3.3 million. The grant was used to\n          purchase an electron microscope which has been capitalised and will be depreciated over 10\n          years. Prior to the introduction of FRS102 such a grant would have been treated as deferred\n          income and released in line with depreciation over the life of the asset.\n                                                                                  \n          Other income has remained broadly similar over the last two years.      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 19",

It is hoped that the government’s post-18 review will target the national fall in part-\n          time numbers and recommend strategies which will have a positive effect in the coming years.\n          Our strategy to introduce full time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be\n          clearly seen in Chart 5.

Although full-time numbers fell slightly in 2017/18 postgraduate students\n          still make up around a third of our total student numbers (FTE).        \n                                                                                  \n          Income from full-time Home and EU students decreased by £0.8 million (2.7%) primarily as a\n          result of the reduction in EU nationals, particularly those already living and working in London.\n          Income from international students rose by £0.7 million and now represents 7.0% of total income\n          (2016/17: 6.3% of total income).

The College does not own any\n          student residences (which increase income without a corresponding increase in staff costs) so\n          this percentage is one of the highest in the sector.                    \n                                              2015/16   2016/17   2017/18         \n                                                £’000     £’000     £’000         \n                                                                                  \n          Gross salaries                       64,436    66,369    70,894         \n          Movement on pension provision          (464)    (181)     (927)         \n                                                                                  \n          Total expenditure on salaries        63,971    66,188    69,967         \n                                                                                  \n          Gross salaries (excluding movement on pension 59.6% 61.1% 65.0%         \n          provision) as a percentage of total income                              \n          Table 3: Change in underlying staff costs                               \n                                                                                  \n          Tuition fees and education contracts provided 62.3% of total income in 2017/18 (2016/17:\n          63.8%). Our budget for 2017/18 assumed that tuition income would rise broadly in line with prior\n          years but as described earlier, this did not happen. Income from tuition fees missed target by\n          £5.7 million in a year in which we invested in additional staff to further improve the student\n          experience. Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in\n          staff costs. This mis-match is a core focus of our recovery plan.       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                           72                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                           70                                                     \n                           68                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                           66                                                     \n                           64                                                     \n                           62                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                           60                                                     \n                           58                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                           56                                                     \n                           54                                                     \n                                2014/15    2015/16   2016/17   2017/18            \n                Tuition fees      62        66        68         66               \n                Staff costs (excl pension                                         \n                                  61        64        66         71               \n                    provision)                                                    \n          Chart 8: Staff costs and tuition income 2014/15 to 2017/18              \n            )m£(                                                                  \n            erutidnepxe/emocnI                                                    \n                    Staff costs and tuition income 2014/15  to                    \n                                     2017/18                                      \n                                      Page 22",

To offset the annual increase in staff costs through inflation and grade drift,\n          growth in income from tuition fees is critical. Since Home undergraduate fee levels are fixed,\n          growth in income must be largely driven from increasing student numbers. Chart 8 clearly\n          demonstrates the sensitivity of the College financial position to student recruitment.\n                                                                                  \n          Governors have agreed a recovery plan which looks to increase student FTE to around 10,500 by\n          2023. A number of strands are currently being developed including: portfolio development;\n          improved retention; increased application to enrolment conversion rates; introduction of access\n          programmes to facilitate progression to postgraduate programmes; increased focus on\n          international recruitment; development of additional on-line delivery etc. In addition, income\n          diversification initiatives will be developed and we will ensure that all costs are efficiently and\n          effectively managed. A deficit budget has been set for 2018/19 with a return to achieving\n          surpluses of 5% of turnover by 2022/23.                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 23",

The level of cash accrued provided\n          Governors with assurance that the first two estates strategy buildings could be completed from\n          reserves without impacting on our financial sustainability. The timing and scope of further\n          building projects will need to be reconsidered.                         \n                                                                                  \n          The triennial valuation of the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) as at 31 March 2017\n          was not approved by the Joint Negotiating Committee. It was agreed that a Joint Expert Panel\n          (JEP) be set up with representatives from Universities UK (on behalf of scheme employers) and\n          the University & Colleges Union (on behalf of scheme members) to review the assumptions used\n          in the valuation. At the end of the financial year the schedule of contributions and benefit\n          structure had not changed and, therefore, the College share of the scheme liability (£11.1\n          million) has been calculated based on the roll forward of existing assumptions.\n          The JEP produced a report and recommendations in September 2018 and this is currently being\n          considered by employers and members. The disputed 2017 valuation calculated that the scheme\n          liabilities had increased and that contributions would need to rise and/or benefits would need to\n          change. The JEP report makes observations which may result in the valuation being recalculated\n          as at 31 March 2018. Due to the fact that there is no contractual commitment at this stage and\n          the extent of any additional liability cannot be reliably estimated, the College has not accounted\n          for an additional provision. Our financial planning makes assumptions about what may transpire,\n          particularly in relation to contribution increases, and the risks associated with the scheme are\n          regularly considered.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          Despite concerns over the potential increasing costs of USS which the College has little direct\n          influence over, coupled with the need to deliver income growth/diversification and expenditure\n          control, the strength of our Balance Sheet provides us with a period in which we can recover. A\n          governance structure has been created to monitor progress against the recovery plan and regular\n          updates are provided to Governors. We are also mindful of the unprecedented uncertainty at the\n          moment but believe that the unique position of the College in the higher education sector will\n          provide us with many opportunities.                                     \n                                                                                  \n          Risk Management                                                         \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n                                                                                  \n          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to\n          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit\n          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key\n          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main\n          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        \n                                                                                  \n          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and\n          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,\n          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established.

Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved\n          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  \n          The top risks for the College for 2018/19 outlined in the annual report are:\n                                                                                  \n            •  Student recruitment                                                \n                                                                                  \n               Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance\n               on tuition fees as our main source of income. Recruitment of students who are European\n               Union nationals fell in 2017/18 as a direct outcome of Brexit. We had anticipated that\n               numbers of London-based EU students would fall gradually as Brexit approached, but\n               instead they fell quickly, apparently as a result of customer confidence and uncertainty\n               rather than regulation. We also over-estimated our ability to continue to increase Masters\n               students following the introduction of postgraduate student loans. Both of these aspects\n               contributed to us failing to hit our student number targets for the year with the result that\n               we returned an underlying deficit (after adjusting for one-off grants).\n                                                                                  \n               The level of risk is likely to remain high in 2018/19 and we are implementing a strategy\n               to recover student numbers through improved recruitment and marketing of existing\n               programmes as well as through diversification of our portfolio and cost management. A\n               recruitment monitoring group led by the Vice Master has been set up to oversee new\n               initiatives and a review has recommended changes aimed at improving the efficiency of\n               application, offer and enrolment processes. Implementing process change will be a\n               priority for the College in the coming months.                     \n                                                                                  \n               Other measures aimed at recovering student numbers include developing new provision\n               to attract new students. The Degree with Foundation Year has launched and has led to\n               growth. We have also put more resource into international recruitment and are expecting\n               to see increased numbers for 2018/19 and beyond. With a high reliance on tuition\n               income, this risk has been given a net risk score of 14.0 (red).   \n            •  Planning and prioritisation of investment                          \n                                                                                  \n               The higher education environment is more competitive than ever (new entrants to the\n               market, development of innovative modes of delivery, removal of student number\n               controls, changing expectations from students) and more uncertain (Brexit, government\n               policy, changing attitudes to higher education, increasing cost pressures such as\n               pensions). As such, it is important for the College to dynamically adapt to circumstances\n               to ensure financial sustainability. The net score assigned to this risk has been increased\n               this year from amber to red primarily due to the fall in student numbers.\n                                                                                  \n               The College has a unique position in the sector being the only evening provider of higher\n               education. A recovery plan has been developed which seeks to build on our usp by\n               maximising recruitment to existing programmes, diversifying income streams through the\n               development of new modes of study or programmes and by reducing costs. Governors\n               remain committed to the aspirations underpinning our Estates Strategy and improving the\n               student experience so it is critical that we focus our attention on strategies which return\n               us to a position of financial sustainability.                      \n                                      Page 25",

Governors have approved the\n               College Estate Strategy (total value around £150 million) which determined that four\n               projects were required. The commencement of two major building projects at a time when\n               the revenue position of the College is under strain will require careful management of\n               project expenditure and may impact on the timing and scale of remaining projects. Risks\n               associated with the delivery of the Estates Strategy have been assigned an overall net\n               score of 12.25 (amber).                                            \n                                                                                  \n            •  Student experience                                                 \n                                                                                  \n               An inability to meet the needs of students and delivery of an optimal student experience\n               could potentially impact both recruitment and retention, result in lower National Student\n               Survey (NSS) scores with a consequent impact on both reputation and recruitment, and\n               lead to students having an unsatisfactory university experience and not reaching their full\n               potential.                                                         \n               Although the Teaching Excellence Framework exercise resulted in a silver award for the\n               College, the NSS has indicated that we need to focus on improving student support. The\n               student body has changed over the last few years, with larger numbers of younger\n               students with different needs and expectations choosing to study with us. Many of our\n               students combine work with study and are consequently time poor. The College Pro Vice\n               Master Education along with a lay Governor led a wide-ranging review of the student\n               experience in 2017/18.

This means to promote, sustain and\n          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills\n          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including\n          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and\n          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual\n          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins\n          everything we do.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in\n          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in\n          the Charities Act (see below for examples).

We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for under-represented\n          students during a time where our student demographics have changed considerably. We remain\n          an evening university, predominantly delivering our teaching between 6-9pm and we retain our\n          historic mission to educate working Londoners.                          \n                                                                                  \n          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students\n          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are BAME\n          or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 94% of our part-time\n          students and 66% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who\n          wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities\n          for students who otherwise would not be able to study.                  \n          In recent years higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have\n          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are hopeful that the\n          introduction of maintenance loans in 2018/19 for part-time students may encourage more\n          students to apply for part-time options.                                \n                                                                                  \n          Despite the challenges faced by the part-time sector our outcomes regarding access to higher\n          education continue to be strong and demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working\n          with non-traditional students. We plan to continue with our current approach on access.\n                                                                                  \n          The following sections are taken from the College Access and Participation Plan 2019/20 and\n          demonstrate our performance against various measures in recent years.   \n                                                                                  \n          Low income households                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          We believe that providing part-time and flexible education can facilitate social and economic\n          mobility and we are pleased that we attract a significant proportion of students from low income\n          backgrounds.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                       2015/16    2016/17         \n                                                                                  \n          Part-time students (household income below £40,000) 32%    46%          \n          Full-time students (household income below £25,000) 40%    39%          \n          Table 6: Proportion of Birkbeck students who applied for financial support from the College\n          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by\n          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In\n          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.\n          We also offer all self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free\n          monthly instalments over the academic year.                             \n                                                                                  \n          Students with non-traditional qualifications                            \n                                                                                  \n          We actively encourage students with non-traditional qualifications to study at Birkbeck. Our\n          outreach work, alongside the various entry routes to degree study, support students without\n          traditional entry qualifications to study successfully at Birkbeck. 25% of part-time entrants had\n          either level 2 (equivalent to GCSE), or lower entry qualifications in 2016/17 (2015/16: 35%).\n          83% of full-time entrants have low tariff or non-tariffable qualifications (source: Birkbeck\n          Teaching Excellence Framework 2 (TEF2) metrics). That a high proportion of students do not have\n          a level 3 qualification is a strong demonstration of our commitment to widening participation and\n          to facilitating social mobility.                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 29",

The Simons Foundation\n          aims to advance the frontiers of research in mathematics and sciences and supports research in\n          mathematics, theoretical physics, theoretical computer science, life sciences and autism\n          research initiatives.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of\n          religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity                   \n                                                                                  \n          In November 2017, Birkbeck’s Institute of Criminal Policy Research (ICPR) published the fourth\n          edition of the World Female Imprisonment List. It showed that the number of women and girls in\n          prison around the world had jumped by more than half since the turn of the century with more\n          than 714,000 women and girls now imprisoned globally. The male prison population increased\n          by around 20% in the same period.                                       \n          The prison research at ICPR aims to bring about a deeper understanding of the many interwoven\n          factors that combine to drive increases in countries’ use of imprisonment and to find concrete,\n          practical solutions to end the unsustainable increases in imprisonment levels that we have seen\n          in recent history. To help with this, the research focuses on providing a much better account of\n          who it is that our states choose to imprison, and why.                  \n                                                                                  \n          Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO)                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The latest data released by the Department of Education published in June 2018 demonstrates\n          how the College produces some of the UK’s highest-earning graduates with salaries way above\n          the average for universities just 12 months after completing studies. Based on the salaries of\n          those who graduated in 2013/14, it shows that one year after graduating Birkbeck graduates are\n          the ninth highest earners among UK institutions, and sixth highest in London, with an average\n          salary of £25.2K. Our graduates have consistently shown salary levels significant above the\n          average for UK’s universities in many areas with Psychology graduates earning the highest\n          median salaries of all UK psychology graduates a year after graduation, earning 36% more than\n          the median.                                                             \n                                      Page 31",

Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to\n          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance\n          against material misstatement or loss.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including\n          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and\n          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of\n          reference. All independent members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the\n          Governors on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.           \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE\n          and the Committee for University Chairs (CUC) for regular effectiveness reviews. The review\n          concluded that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in\n          place measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more\n          opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings. In 2016/17\n          four new independent governors were appointed following an open call for expressions of\n          interest, which increased the diversity of the Governing Body.          \n          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of\n          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. In 2018\n          the Governing Body agreed changes to the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference and\n          reporting protocol, to increase transparency and accountability in line with new guidance from\n          the CUC. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's\n          processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code.

It also considers issues of succession planning and diversity within the\n          Governing Body.                                                         \n          The Nominations Committee met once during the year.                     \n                                                                                  \n          Remuneration Committee                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          In 2017/18 the Remuneration Committee determined the annual remuneration of the Master\n          and of professorial and senior administrative staff. Independent members of Governing Body\n          receive no remuneration for their services although expenses incurred in attending meetings are\n          met by the College. Members of the Governing Body who are employees of the College receive no\n          additional remuneration for their services to the Governing Body. The cost of living salary\n          increases for all staff are determined by national pay negotiations for all universities. The\n          employee members have no involvement in determining their own salaries. \n                                                                                  \n          The Remuneration Committee met three (2016/17: one) times during the year. As well as its\n          existing business of setting senior staff remuneration, it considered the Committee for University\n          Chairs’ new guidance on remuneration committees, and in response has recommended revisions\n          to its terms of reference. The revisions include confirmation that the Committee’s membership is\n          wholly independent and does not include any College staff, a focus on remuneration of the core\n          senior team, a stronger link between remuneration and individual and institutional performance,\n          and more extensive and transparent reporting of the Committee’s decisions.\n                                      Page 35",

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an\n             expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                                                                                  \n             Defined benefit plan                                                 \n                                                                                  \n             Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine\n             its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed by a\n             qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Any unused benefits are\n             accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused\n             entitlement.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n       6.

Contingent liabilities also arise in circumstances where a provision would otherwise\n             be made but either it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the\n             obligation cannot be measured reliably.                              \n                                                                                  \n             A contingent asset arises where an event has taken place that gives the College a possible asset whose\n             existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly\n             within the control of the College.                                   \n                                                                                  \n             Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the notes.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       17.

It is, therefore, a\n             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is\n             potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered\n             by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of\n             Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable\n             purposes.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is\n             included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their\n             cost.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n             The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial\n             organisation.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 50",

The College has\n           met, managed and overcome major strategic threats - the loss of 40% of core teaching funding due to\n           government policy change in 2007 and the fundamental 60% decline in traditional part-time study post\n           2012. The College’s distinct mission stands out in the sector: widening access, opportunity and flexibility for\n           students in an environment informed by the best research. Birkbeck is one of only twenty UK institutions\n           that rate highly in both REF and TEF. Delivering successfully on its mission in this environment has required\n           the College to restructure, reposition, re-invent and innovate. The Master’s role in delivering this change,\n           operating in a long-standing, collegial environment, building the widest base of support amongst students,\n           staff, stakeholders and funders, has been vital to the viability and success of the College.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 55",

From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the\n           S2P. A defined contribution section was introduced in October 2016. The fund is independently\n           administered by trustees. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not hypothecated to\n           individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The College is, therefore, exposed to\n           actuarial risks associated with the employees of other institutions and is unable to identify its share of the\n           underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Consequently, and as\n           required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the College accounts for the scheme as if it were a\n           defined contribution scheme.                                           \n                                                                                  \n           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists\n           of a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer\n           scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide\n           scheme such as that provided by USS. The members of USS have entered into an agreement with the\n           scheme trustees which determines how they will fund the net pension deficit in the scheme. The accounting\n           principles pertaining to multi-employer schemes require the College to recognise the contributions payable\n           that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) as a liability in the Balance\n           Sheet. The resulting expense is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.\n           College governors are satisfied that the scheme provided by USS meets the definition of a multi-employer\n           scheme and have, therefore, recognised as a liability the discounted fair value of the contractual\n           contributions under the funding plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n           The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation\n           date”). The valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. The valuation as at 31 March 2017\n           is underway but not yet completed. Since the College cannot identify its share of the scheme assets and\n           liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for the scheme as a whole.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its\n           obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). The recovery\n           plan in the 2014 actuarial valuation requires employers to contribute 2.1% of salaries towards repairing the\n           deficit over a period of 17 years, of which 14 years remain.           \n                                                                                  \n           The 2017 actuarial valuation of USS has been undertaken but this has not yet formerly completed. The\n           2017 valuation has set out the challenges currently facing the scheme and the likelihood of significant\n           increases in contributions being required to address these challenges. \n                                                                                  \n           In the judgement of the College, as the 2017 valuation has not formerly completed, and there remains\n           various stages of consultation around the key factors specifically relating to the funding of the past deficit,\n           including the level of contributions required, the period of the recovery plan and the level of asset\n           performance over the period, it remains appropriate to continue to account for the past deficit obligation in\n           accordance with the plan agreed after the 2014 actuarial valuation.    \n                                                                                  \n           However, there is a significant risk that the year-end provision as calculated will not reflect the position\n           following the outcome of negotiations, potentially by a very significant amount depending upon what is\n           finally agreed as regards to future deficit contributions and their duration. The College expects to have\n           greater clarity in this respect during the next financial year.        \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 69",

From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the\n           S2P.                                                                   \n           SAUL is an independently managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and\n           institutions with links to higher education.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on either a final salary basis or a career average\n           revalued earnings (“CARE”) basis. Following a consultation with members, it was agreed that the final salary\n           section would close from 31 March 2016 and all members would subsequently build up benefits on a CARE\n           basis.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n           The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations\n           under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the\n           amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be\n           spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.\n                                                                                  \n           SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by\n           the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The trustees adopt\n           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits\n           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from members’ accrued\n           pension rights to be met.                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The assumptions used to calculate the Technical Provisions include appropriate margins to allow for the\n           possibility of events turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not\n           completely remove the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the\n           future.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and\n           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.\n           Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new\n           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The funding principles were reviewed at SAUL’s next formal valuation in 2017. The valuation confirmed that\n           there is no deficit to correct and as a result no further recovery plan contributions or provision is required.\n                                                                                  \n           The trustees and employers agreed that the Technical Provisions deficit at the 31 March 2014 valuation will\n           be addressed by employer contributions of 3% of salaries between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2018\n           (inclusive). As a result the overall level of the employers’ contributions increased from 13% of salaries to\n           16% of salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 71",
