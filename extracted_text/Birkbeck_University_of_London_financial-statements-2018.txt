OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Master’s Report
Operating environment
Birkbeck provides access to degree education for working Londoners. Our teaching takes place in
the evening with a consequence that most of our students are mature and have jobs, caring or
other responsibilities during the day. We have a heritage as a specialist provider of part-time
education; however, with the advent of the ELQ policy and the 2012 funding changes, we have
seen significant shifts in our student profile. Our part-time undergraduate population has
contracted by over 60% in line with much of the sector. The launch of our full-time degrees from
2010 compensated for this decline and the College now has around 2,900 full time equivalent
(FTE) full-time undergraduates (from around zero in 2009) and 2,900 FTE part-time
undergraduates (source: HESA 2016). During this transition the College remained true to its
mission with teaching still taking place in the evening and access being available to all. 25% of
part-time entrants at Birkbeck had either level 2 (equivalent to GCSE) or lower entry qualifications
in 2016/17 and 83% of full-time entrants had low tariff or non-tariffable qualifications (source:
Birkbeck TEF2 metrics). 42% of full-time students had a household income of under £25,000
and 64% of part-time students had a household income of under £40,000 (source: applications
for Birkbeck bursary scheme 2017/18).
Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since
2010, the College made a deficit of £0,5 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off
equipment grant) and is budgeting for an underlying deficit again in 2018/19. The main cause of
this was a significant fall in EU students in 2017/18: we recruited 300 headcount fewer EU
students in 2017/18 than in 2016/17. This effect is largely limited to EU students already living
in London whilst we have seen an increase in demand from EU students living on the continent.
We believe that this is a direct result of Brexit related uncertainty over employment and
residency.
The introduction of the postgraduate loan in 2016/17 saw an increase of 34% in recruitment of
new Masters students at Birkbeck compared with 19% in England as a whole. Our model enables
people who are already in work to study without giving up their job and the loan has proved to be
an enabler for this market. This growth position was largely consolidated in 2017/18. The UK
Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) has forecast that the number of Londoners
qualified with ‘Other higher degree’ (mainly Masters) will increase by a third by 2022 and the
population of London qualified with a First Degree – i.e. the potential market for Masters - is
projected to increase by 13%. Postgraduate programmes will remain a key focus for our
recruitment strategy.
In addition to this, we launched a Degree with Foundation Year in 2017/18. Despite being
launched part-way through the admissions cycle we recruited 163 students into the first cohort
and anticipate growth as all four cohorts are filled. We will extend the Degree with Foundation
Year offering across all five Schools in 2018/19.
Since 2010/11 international undergraduate students at Birkbeck have increased from near zero
to a 0.5% share of the London market. This is still well below our share of the total London full-
time undergraduate market at 1.3%. In 2017/18, international postgraduate students at
Birkbeck increased by 15% to 300 FTE. This is as a result of carefully targeted marketing efforts
including tactical use of scholarship schemes. We also invested further in the international
marketing team to increase recruitment from our most promising markets. Birkbeck is a major
provider of Masters programmes to the Home-EU market being the 6th largest provider by
headcount in the UK equating to 2.2% of the London market. By contrast, we have 1% of the
equivalent market for international students. Our impressive research reputation and University

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
of London brand should enable us to recruit significantly more international students to Masters
programmes and this is a strategic objective for the coming years.
Against the backdrop of falling student numbers in 2017/18, increased competition from a more
open higher education market, risks associated with Brexit, the uncertain outcome of a
government post-18 review and increased cost pressures, particularly around pensions, we have
had to develop a plan which returns us to a position of surpluses and financial sustainability.
Our institutional strategy commits us to a series of investments designed to improve the quality
of our core teaching and research activities and to modernise our material and organisational
infrastructure. Cumulatively the goal is to ensure that we keep true to our unique mission and
look and perform at a level in keeping with our reputation for excellence.
Crucial strands of this strategy are:
• Student experience review implementation, ensuring that our diverse student body
is properly supported to succeed resulting in strong NSS and TEF outcomes;
• Estates strategy for expansion and modernisation of the estate, addressing
longstanding issues about teaching space and delivering appropriate research
facilities;
• Improved research support infrastructure to cement our place in the top tranche of
research intensive institutions at the REF.
Financially, tuition fee income is and will remain our key income stream and due to our mode and
mission we are far more dependent on tuition fee income than most of our peers with it
representing over 60% of our turnover. To deliver this strategy we need to return as quickly as
possible to a student body of around 10,500 FTE. In 2017/18 our student body totalled 8,815
FTE compared to 9,164 FTE in 2016/17. Recruitment in 2018/19 looks more positive than in
2017/18 but on forecast rates of student number growth it will take us at least another year to
recover the lost numbers, with several years further expansion beyond that needed to deliver the
level of student recruitment needed to ensure financial sustainability.
None of our three key institutional goals are self-funding. All require upfront investment and the
primary gains are in terms of depth and quality and in moving the experience of students and
staff on to a par with the comparator institutions against which we benchmark ourselves. Whilst
in the long term there will be financial gains - directly through improved retention and research
funding and indirectly as a result of reputational impact – these will not be at a level that in and
of itself sustains a higher equilibrium.
When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with
turnover of £100 to 250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we
are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost
pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode and student
body adds major complexity and inflexibility to our underlying business model. Provision at the
heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue other
activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity into 15 hours a
week in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be
addressed.
More fundamentally, in addition to tuition fee and income, our benchmark competitors currently
have significant additional income streams, primarily through campus/facility related income and
through knowledge transfer/spin off/commercialisation activities. As we have neither residences
nor a science park/innovation hub, we lack these income streams.

Birkbeck, University of London
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2018
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
These comparisons do indicate that in order to function at a higher equilibrium we need to
generate additional income streams of our own. Whilst growth based on our existing portfolio is
an important part of any recovery plan we also need to spread risk by investing in growth across
a range of initiatives.
To do so, we have looked back to our unique mission and unrivalled location and attempted to
turn them to our advantage rather than see them solely as drivers of increased cost and
complexity. As an institution embedded in the social fabric of a metropolis we are seeking to
generate additional activity and income streams aligned with the needs of London’s culture,
economy and society.
In tandem with developing additional income streams and increasing student numbers we must
also closely manage our staff cost base. We are committed to maintaining promotion and
recruitment processes which develop and reward talent. We are also making interventions in
relation to our equalities and diversity strategy and looking to integrate and support teaching and
scholarship staff who are currently on sessional contracts (some on an open-ended basis as part
of an ongoing role, others in response to specific and non-recurrent needs). In this context the
adoption of an expectations and workload framework for academic staff, alongside compulsory
appraisal/review, is a significant development which enables us to ensure that we are using our
resources effectively.
The issues of complexity, and the incremental layering of new activities onto pre-existing
structures as the College has sought to rapidly adapt, identified in relation to teaching is also true
for the College’s professional and support services and School-based administrations. Whilst
elements of this have been and are being tackled with focused reviews of specific processes,
the current situation requires a more holistic externally supported review that focuses
additionally on organisation, capacity, capability and resource that will inform service planning
and delivery in this new climate. Cumulatively both the development trajectory we are proposing,
and these initiatives, do constitute a significant level of organisational change.
In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
Birkbeck set out his vision:
‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’
This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,
work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer
transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,
practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. Within an increasingly volatile
operating environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and
contribution to science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all
of our activities.

Awards
Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards received during
the year.
Martin Paul Eve, Professor of Literature, Technology and Publishing at Birkbeck, has been
awarded the Medal of Honour in the Humanities and Social Sciences by KU Leuven in Belgium.
The Medal of Honour is awarded to laureates of exceptional academic or social distinction who
make a unique contribution to the mutual relationship between faculties and universities.
Professor Eve is known for his higher education policy work around open access (OA) in addition
to his research interests in contemporary American fiction, histories and philosophies of
technology, and technological mutations in scholarly publishing. Professor Eve is one of the
founding directors (together with Dr Caroline Edwards) of the Open Library of Humanities (OLH) -
a non-profit publisher devoted to OA run by academics. He is also currently leading a major
project into the peer review process, analysing its role in the research cycle to develop better
ways of using expert opinion to assess and improve published research.
Two Birkbeck academics won awards for their books: Dr Matthew Champion won the Gladstone
Prize, for his book The Fullness of Time: Temporalities of the Fifteenth-Century Low Countries and
Professor Frank Trentmann was awarded the 2018 Austrian Science Prize for the best book in
the humanities, social sciences and cultural studies for Herrschaft Der Dinge, the German edition
of his title Empire of Things. The Gladstone prize is awarded by the Royal Historical Society to a
solely written first book published in the UK on a historical subject which is not primarily about
British history. The Austrian Science Prize was launched in 2007 by the Austrian Ministry of
Education, Science and Research to recognise excellence in non-fiction writing. Professor
Trentmann’s book was shortlisted for its category by a jury of experts and won following a public
vote across bookshops, libraries and on the prize’s website.
Laura Mulvey, Professor of Film in the Department of Film, Media and Cultural Studies, was given
an honorary degree from Yale University. The award was made at a ceremony attended by
10,000 people where Professor Mulvey was described as one of the great figures in the history of
film theory. Her citation went on to say: “Lauded for her influential role in developing the field of
feminist film theory, she has inspired generations of scholars at Yale and around the world.”
Dr Sue Brooks from Birkbeck’s Department of Geography won the Geographical Association (GA)
Award for Excellence in Leading Geography. The award was voted on by members of the GA and
given to the author of the article in each of the GA’s journals that is felt to have made the most
significant contribution to geographical teaching and learning. Her selected paper, Coastal
resilience and vulnerability: storm impacts, extreme weather and regional variability in the UK,
winter 2013–14, looked at the high-magnitude storms and the impact they caused in the west
and south-west of the UK over the winter of 2013-14. A statement from the GA noted that the
article “highlights how new technologies are being used to quantify some of the key coastal
impacts of such events.” The Geographical Association is a national organisation with over 5,000
members and is devoted to the dissemination of good practice in delivering the geography
curriculum to schools.
Bill Bowring, Professor of Law, was conferred as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences
(AcSS), alongside 68 other leading social scientists. Professor Bowring is Director of the LLM/MA
in Human Rights at Birkbeck and a leading expert in the UK on legal and human rights issues in
Russia and the countries of the Former Soviet Union, and Eastern and Central Europe. His
research is particularly interested in minority rights and international law, and is enriched by his

practice as a barrister, through which he has taken many cases to the European Court of Human
Rights against Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Russia and Turkey. He has also frequently
acted as an expert for the Council of Europe, OSCE, European Union, and United Nations, as well
as advising the UK government.
Finally, President of Birkbeck Baroness Joan Bakewell DBE was elected as an Honorary Fellow of
the British Academy. The British Academy is a community of over 1,400 of the leading minds that
make up the UK’s national academy for the humanities and social sciences. Professor Lynda
Nead, Pevsner Chair of History of Art at Birkbeck, was made a Fellow of the Academy. They join a
number of other members of College staff including Professor Joanna Bourke, Professor Marina
Warner and Professor Mark Johnson.
Estates
The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary space,
to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to improve research
facilities. Governors have approved the College Estate Strategy which determined that four
projects were required to improve the quality of our research and teaching space and also to
increase the amount of teaching space that was under the direct, or shared, control of the
College.
A governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards
(membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design teams,
senior College staff and independent Governors) which feed in to Estates Committee (a sub-
committee of Finance & General Purposes Committee). The structure aims to ensure that all
aspects of each project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is
obtained, the building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on
major projects are also provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee to provide assurance
that all risks are being appropriately managed.
For the past twenty years, the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development’s (CBCD) BabyLab has
been investigating the psychological processes in infants’ brains and they have uncovered major
insights into child development. The BabyLab scientists have identified the earliest marker of
autism in babies, examined the links between Down’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease and
investigated the effects of screen time on babies as young as six-months-old. The first project to
commence construction is a purpose built ToddlerLab to extend the research of CBCD to older
children. Costing over £11 million the building project has received generous donations from the
Wohl Foundation and the Woolfson Foundation.
The ToddlerLab will be equipped with sophisticated wireless technology which allows toddlers to
be toddlers while tracking their brain activity and monitoring their behaviour. An example of the
cutting-edge technology is a virtual environment known as the “CAVE” which simulates real-world
surroundings, such as a farm or a supermarket, and monitors how toddlers’ brain activity
changes depending on the world around them. The CAVE and other equipment in the building
has been supported by an innovative crowdfunding campaign, a significant donation from an
alumnus of the College and an equipment grant from the Wellcome Trust. The ToddlerLab is
scheduled to open in 2019/20.
In April 2018 the College received planning permission from the London Borough of Camden to
renovate and extend a 1920’s building, called Cambridge House, on Euston Road. London-based
architect, Penoyre & Prasad, added a copper-clad two-storey lecture theatre to the top of the
existing structure to create a flexible and high quality teaching space. The plans will also include
a café and active learning space on the ground floor with a basement and teaching classrooms
on the upper floors. The building will add around 440 square metres of additional teaching space

to the College building portfolio providing capacity for over 600 students and staff.
In addition to the new building projects our long term cash flow forecast includes prudent
estimates for: unspecified capital amendments to existing buildings; capital elements of our long
term maintenance plan; replacement of existing combined heat and power system; and capital
equipment. We do not expect to spend these funds in full but we are keen to ensure that the
main building projects are affordable even in a scenario where significant additional capital
funding was required.
Gender pay gap
Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, the
College was required to report gender pay data to the government for the first time in March
2018. The metrics used were based on data to 31 March 2017 and will be updated annually.
The College undertakes a full pay audit periodically to provide analysis and recommendations in
relation to reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the
institution. We support the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and are committed to
operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which
rewards staff in line with the College’s commitment to equality and diversity. These reviews
analyse pay gaps by ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation as well as gender.
The gender pay data published in March 2018 for hourly pay and bonus pay is summarised in
Tables 1 and 2:
Mean hourly pay Median hourly pay Total employees
Female (£) Male (£) Female (£) Male (£) Female Male
22.05 23.85 20.02 21.12 1,066 951
Gender pay gap 7.6% lower Gender pay gap 5.2% lower Total employees 2,017
Table 1: Gender pay gap – hourly pay
Mean bonus pay Median bonus pay Total receiving bonus
Female (£) Male (£) Female (£) Male (£) Female Male
468 1,800 400 600 3.5% 2.2%
Gender pay gap 74.0% lower Gender pay gap 33.3% lower Total receiving bonus 58
Table 2: Gender pay gap – bonus pay
Benchmarking data compiled in early April 2018 indicated that Birkbeck was ranked 11th out of
126 institutions in the Higher Education sector for median gender pay gap and 13th for mean. In
the education sector as a whole, the median gender pay gap was reported at 20%.
The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
favour of men; there are 6.2% fewer women in the highest paid quartile and 11.6% more women
in the lowest paid quartile. This clustering of men and women at different levels of an
organisation, referred to as a vertical pay gap, is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector,
although less pronounced at Birkbeck. The population distribution is a significant factor in the
overall gender pay gap. The College monitors the diversity of population changes through
promotion, recruitment and exit. Targeted actions from previous pay reviews and other gender
analysis activities, such as Athena SWAN, have been identified and put in place to address
population imbalances. For example, the academic promotion schemes were modified and this
has resulted in an increased application and promotion rate of women to more senior academic
roles.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2018
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
The 2017 equal pay analysis identified a number of key measures which the College can take to
reduce gender pay gaps:
• The use of equitable pay and reward arrangements which are objectively justifiable,
using proper and effective systems such as job evaluation where appropriate;
• Increasing the number of women that are under-represented in certain occupationally
stratified sections of the workforce;
• Increasing the number of women in more senior levels through internal promotion and
external recruitment;
• Continuing to analyse and monitor all aspects of pay differentials;
• Being transparent in our equal pay analysis and findings.
Birkbeck has committed to a number of targets and objectives arising from all areas of this
analysis which will help contribute to a reduction in pay inequality:
• Reduce the mean gender pay gap by a minimum of 1% by 2021;
• Reduce the mean Professorial pay gap to 5% or lower by 2021;
• Reduce the mean pay gap between men and women in senior Professional and Support
roles by at least 2% by 2021;
• Address the underlying factors affecting equal pay through wider equality and diversity
programmes and strategic interventions in other areas (such as recruitment, promotion,
training, education and reward).
The recommendations which will help to achieve these objectives are set out in detail in the
aforementioned 2017 pay audit. The key activities are:
• Develop and introduce a new Reward and Recognition Strategy;
• Review and introduce a revised approach to recruitment and retention;
• Increase flexible working at all levels and ensure no detriment to career development;
• Introduce career development and positive action measures to address under-
representation at senior levels;
• Further improve promotion of women in academic roles and specifically take positive
action to promote progression to Professorial level;
• Set equality and diversity targets for representation in the workforce and equal pay within
College-wide KPIs;
• Conduct further analysis of pay intervention points and occupational segregation.
It should be noted that the majority of recommended actions or initiatives are already underway
or planned via other initiatives and strategies including the People Strategy, School and
Professional Services Annual Plans, Athena SWAN and other charter marks in particular.
Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2017
to 31 March 2018
The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility Time is the
provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown on the
next page.

health support programmes and award winning programmes such as our Compass
Project;
• academic research and PhD studentships through initiatives like the Research
Innovation Fund which provides seed funding for new research ideas, post-doctoral
awards for emerging academics and PhD scholarships for the next generation of
academic thinkers;
• capital projects, facilities and equipment by catalysing projects like technology
enhanced learning, supporting state of the art equipment for our researchers and
contributing to new building such as the Wohl Wolfson ToddlerLab;
• unrestricted funding for areas of greatest need - our donors support Birkbeck and our
mission and many of them are comfortable knowing that the College will direct their
philanthropy to the areas of greatest need, be it students, infrastructure or research.

Nearly 300 volunteers donated 3,700 hours (2016/17: 3,500 hours) of their time to enhance
the student experience and support learners across the College. These volunteers play an
important role in aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives.
During 2018 new General Data Protection Regulations came into effect. Birkbeck exists to
provide life changing educational opportunities for its students and undertake cutting-edge
research for the public good. In order to carry out this mission, it is necessary to process personal
data. We invested significant time to ensure that we process data transparently, fairly, lawfully,
safely and securely. We renewed our policies to strengthen our commitment and processes
around data privacy.
As we move towards our 200th anniversary in 2023, our alumni and supporters will be vital in
helping us to achieve our ambitious strategic priorities. Over the coming year we will broaden our
fundraising activity; deepen our relationships with current supporters and attract new donors to
support these ambitions.
Despite a very strong performance in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the award
of a Silver grade in the 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) and strong financial
performance over a number of years we were disappointed to find that EU student recruitment
fell following the Brexit referendum and for the first time since 2009 the College posted a deficit
(after adjusting for one-off equipment grants). Although there are an unprecedented number of
significant uncertainties in the higher education sector at the moment the external reviews (TEF
and REF) validate our strategic objective to deliver high quality teaching and research. As we
enter a period of recovery we are still confidently defining our ambitions and vision for Birkbeck
in its third century.

Chart 4: Analysis of income 2017/18
The recurrent teaching grant from the government continues to fall as an increasing proportion of
our tuition fees are paid by student loans. Teaching grant fell by a further £0.6 million in
2017/18 (a reduction of 10.0% year-on-year). Teaching grant now represents only 5.5% of
College income in comparison with 47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees
has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to 60.7% in 2017/18 (although this is down by £1.4 million on
2016/17).
Income from research grants and contracts is slightly skewed this year due to the recognition as
income of a non-government funded equipment grant of £3.3 million. The grant was used to
purchase an electron microscope which has been capitalised and will be depreciated over 10
years. Prior to the introduction of FRS102 such a grant would have been treated as deferred
income and released in line with depreciation over the life of the asset.
Other income has remained broadly similar over the last two years.

Chart 5: Main levels of study enrolment trends 2011/12 to 2017/18
The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since 2011/12 continues but appears
to be slowing. It is hoped that the government’s post-18 review will target the national fall in part-
time numbers and recommend strategies which will have a positive effect in the coming years.
Our strategy to introduce full time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be
clearly seen in Chart 5. We continue to recruit well in a competitive undergraduate market in
London despite enrolments being affected by a reduction in EU nationals.
In 2016/17, postgraduate recruitment showed a marked increase due to the introduction of the
post graduate loan. Although full-time numbers fell slightly in 2017/18 postgraduate students
still make up around a third of our total student numbers (FTE).
Income from full-time Home and EU students decreased by £0.8 million (2.7%) primarily as a
result of the reduction in EU nationals, particularly those already living and working in London.
Income from international students rose by £0.7 million and now represents 7.0% of total income
(2016/17: 6.3% of total income). Income from part-time students fell by £1.3 million despite a
modest increase in the number of students studying part-time Masters programmes.

The analysis of expenditure confirms that the College continues to invest heavily in education
and research with only 19.9% of total expenditure (2016/17: 19.3%) spent on administration
and other professional services.
Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision) has
risen from 59.6% in 2015/16 to 65.0% in 2017/18 (see Table 3). The College does not own any
student residences (which increase income without a corresponding increase in staff costs) so
this percentage is one of the highest in the sector.

Table 3: Change in underlying staff costs
Tuition fees and education contracts provided 62.3% of total income in 2017/18 (2016/17:
63.8%). Our budget for 2017/18 assumed that tuition income would rise broadly in line with prior
years but as described earlier, this did not happen. Income from tuition fees missed target by
£5.7 million in a year in which we invested in additional staff to further improve the student
experience. Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in
staff costs. This mis-match is a core focus of our recovery plan.

Table 4: Key financial data 2014/15 to 2017/18
Adjusting for a one-off non-government funded equipment grant the College returned an
underlying deficit of £0.5 million in 2017/18 against total comprehensive income of £7.5 million
the year before. To offset the annual increase in staff costs through inflation and grade drift,
growth in income from tuition fees is critical. Since Home undergraduate fee levels are fixed,
growth in income must be largely driven from increasing student numbers. Chart 8 clearly
demonstrates the sensitivity of the College financial position to student recruitment.
Governors have agreed a recovery plan which looks to increase student FTE to around 10,500 by
2023. A number of strands are currently being developed including: portfolio development;
improved retention; increased application to enrolment conversion rates; introduction of access
programmes to facilitate progression to postgraduate programmes; increased focus on
international recruitment; development of additional on-line delivery etc. In addition, income
diversification initiatives will be developed and we will ensure that all costs are efficiently and
effectively managed. A deficit budget has been set for 2018/19 with a return to achieving
surpluses of 5% of turnover by 2022/23.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2018
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Prior to this year’s shortfall in student recruitment, the College has been regularly returning
strong surpluses and generating cash from its operations. The level of cash accrued provided
Governors with assurance that the first two estates strategy buildings could be completed from
reserves without impacting on our financial sustainability. The timing and scope of further
building projects will need to be reconsidered.
The triennial valuation of the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) as at 31 March 2017
was not approved by the Joint Negotiating Committee. It was agreed that a Joint Expert Panel
(JEP) be set up with representatives from Universities UK (on behalf of scheme employers) and
the University & Colleges Union (on behalf of scheme members) to review the assumptions used
in the valuation. At the end of the financial year the schedule of contributions and benefit
structure had not changed and, therefore, the College share of the scheme liability (£11.1
million) has been calculated based on the roll forward of existing assumptions.
The JEP produced a report and recommendations in September 2018 and this is currently being
considered by employers and members. The disputed 2017 valuation calculated that the scheme
liabilities had increased and that contributions would need to rise and/or benefits would need to
change. The JEP report makes observations which may result in the valuation being recalculated
as at 31 March 2018. Due to the fact that there is no contractual commitment at this stage and
the extent of any additional liability cannot be reliably estimated, the College has not accounted
for an additional provision. Our financial planning makes assumptions about what may transpire,
particularly in relation to contribution increases, and the risks associated with the scheme are
regularly considered.
Despite concerns over the potential increasing costs of USS which the College has little direct
influence over, coupled with the need to deliver income growth/diversification and expenditure
control, the strength of our Balance Sheet provides us with a period in which we can recover. A
governance structure has been created to monitor progress against the recovery plan and regular
updates are provided to Governors. We are also mindful of the unprecedented uncertainty at the
moment but believe that the unique position of the College in the higher education sector will
provide us with many opportunities.
Risk Management
An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
internal control last year and will continue to do so.
The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to
risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit
Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key
parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main
reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.
The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and
professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and
evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,
for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The
risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
report on internal control and risk for 2017/18 was presented to the Audit Committee in May
2018.
Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
(highest impact and likelihood) is 25.
The top risks for the College for 2018/19 outlined in the annual report are:
• Student recruitment
Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance
on tuition fees as our main source of income. Recruitment of students who are European
Union nationals fell in 2017/18 as a direct outcome of Brexit. We had anticipated that
numbers of London-based EU students would fall gradually as Brexit approached, but
instead they fell quickly, apparently as a result of customer confidence and uncertainty
rather than regulation. We also over-estimated our ability to continue to increase Masters
students following the introduction of postgraduate student loans. Both of these aspects
contributed to us failing to hit our student number targets for the year with the result that
we returned an underlying deficit (after adjusting for one-off grants).
The level of risk is likely to remain high in 2018/19 and we are implementing a strategy
to recover student numbers through improved recruitment and marketing of existing
programmes as well as through diversification of our portfolio and cost management. A
recruitment monitoring group led by the Vice Master has been set up to oversee new
initiatives and a review has recommended changes aimed at improving the efficiency of
application, offer and enrolment processes. Implementing process change will be a
priority for the College in the coming months.
Other measures aimed at recovering student numbers include developing new provision
to attract new students. The Degree with Foundation Year has launched and has led to
growth. We have also put more resource into international recruitment and are expecting
to see increased numbers for 2018/19 and beyond. With a high reliance on tuition
income, this risk has been given a net risk score of 14.0 (red).
• Planning and prioritisation of investment
The higher education environment is more competitive than ever (new entrants to the
market, development of innovative modes of delivery, removal of student number
controls, changing expectations from students) and more uncertain (Brexit, government
policy, changing attitudes to higher education, increasing cost pressures such as
pensions). As such, it is important for the College to dynamically adapt to circumstances
to ensure financial sustainability. The net score assigned to this risk has been increased
this year from amber to red primarily due to the fall in student numbers.
The College has a unique position in the sector being the only evening provider of higher
education. A recovery plan has been developed which seeks to build on our usp by
maximising recruitment to existing programmes, diversifying income streams through the
development of new modes of study or programmes and by reducing costs. Governors
remain committed to the aspirations underpinning our Estates Strategy and improving the
student experience so it is critical that we focus our attention on strategies which return
us to a position of financial sustainability.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
School Executive Deans and key strategic staff regularly meet to consider areas for
investment and to oversee the delivery of projects identified in the recovery plan.
Strategic Planning Committee is the executive body responsible for returning the College
to a sustainable financial position and reports on progress and risks are provided to
Governors through the committee structure.
• Estates Strategy
A number of risks have been noted in relation to the Estates Strategy including: projects
do not effectively meet the stated objectives; project budgets are not appropriately
managed; and long term cash levels negatively impact our financial sustainability. A
governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects which includes Project
Boards (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external
design teams, senior College staff and independent Governors) which feed in to Estates
Committee (a sub-committee of Finance & General Purposes Committee). The structure
aims to ensure that all aspects of each project are appropriately managed. Reports on
major projects are also provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee and the
management of major projects is routinely reviewed by our internal auditor.
It is our aim that all Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck
facilities or in buildings shared with other HE institutions. Governors have approved the
College Estate Strategy (total value around £150 million) which determined that four
projects were required. The commencement of two major building projects at a time when
the revenue position of the College is under strain will require careful management of
project expenditure and may impact on the timing and scale of remaining projects. Risks
associated with the delivery of the Estates Strategy have been assigned an overall net
score of 12.25 (amber).
• Student experience
An inability to meet the needs of students and delivery of an optimal student experience
could potentially impact both recruitment and retention, result in lower National Student
Survey (NSS) scores with a consequent impact on both reputation and recruitment, and
lead to students having an unsatisfactory university experience and not reaching their full
potential.
Although the Teaching Excellence Framework exercise resulted in a silver award for the
College, the NSS has indicated that we need to focus on improving student support. The
student body has changed over the last few years, with larger numbers of younger
students with different needs and expectations choosing to study with us. Many of our
students combine work with study and are consequently time poor. The College Pro Vice
Master Education along with a lay Governor led a wide-ranging review of the student
experience in 2017/18. The report recommendations are currently being implemented.
While student retention is not declining, it is not where we want it to be - part time
retention is higher than the national benchmark and full time retention is lower. With
many of our students in full time employment there is always a risk that students drop
out due to their employer moving from London and we are developing on line solutions
which allow students in this position the opportunity to complete their course. As well as
the metric for retention between years one and two which is benchmarked by HESA we
need to understand the pattern of drop out in later years and the barriers to course
completion and graduation.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Regular reports on progress against the recommendations from the student experience
review, most of which are expected to have a positive impact on retention, are provided
to Governors.
The potential impact on student recruitment of failing to provide services that meet
student need is significant and the risk has been assigned a net score of 12.25 (amber).
Brexit has not been included in our risk register as a specific risk due to the uncertain outcome of
the negotiations and the impact on universities (although it is expected that the impact is likely to
be negative for the sector). Reports on the possible risks, including the potential impact of a no-
deal Brexit, are routinely prepared. This risk will be carefully monitored as government
negotiations are finalised.
Audit Committee was provided with an update in September of the main developments since
they approved the College risk register in May. The net scores for each of the main risks
remained unchanged.
On behalf of the Governing Body, I would like to thank all staff for their dedication and support in
ensuring the success of Birkbeck and its unique mission as a research-led teaching institution
with a strong commitment to flexible patterns of teaching.

Public Benefit Statement
The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:
“The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Act describes 13
broad areas of charitable activity. The Governing Body has regard to the Charity Commission’s
guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in the following manner.
The advancement of education
The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.
The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins
everything we do.
In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
the Charities Act (see below for examples). The following table summarises our research income
over the last three years:
2015/16 2016/17 2017/18
Research income (£’000) 10,082 9,091 12,941
Income as a percentage of total income 9.3% 8.4% 11.9%
Table 5: Research income trends
Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. The College currently has a
portfolio of live research projects linked to over £50 million in external grant funding.
The prevention or relief of poverty
The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
(prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Birkbeck is proud to be a university which opens its doors to people who may otherwise not be
able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for under-represented
students during a time where our student demographics have changed considerably. We remain
an evening university, predominantly delivering our teaching between 6-9pm and we retain our
historic mission to educate working Londoners.
Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are BAME
or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 94% of our part-time
students and 66% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who
wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities
for students who otherwise would not be able to study.
In recent years higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are hopeful that the
introduction of maintenance loans in 2018/19 for part-time students may encourage more
students to apply for part-time options.
Despite the challenges faced by the part-time sector our outcomes regarding access to higher
education continue to be strong and demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working
with non-traditional students. We plan to continue with our current approach on access.
The following sections are taken from the College Access and Participation Plan 2019/20 and
demonstrate our performance against various measures in recent years.
Low income households
We believe that providing part-time and flexible education can facilitate social and economic
mobility and we are pleased that we attract a significant proportion of students from low income
backgrounds.
2015/16 2016/17
Part-time students (household income below £40,000) 32% 46%
Full-time students (household income below £25,000) 40% 39%
Table 6: Proportion of Birkbeck students who applied for financial support from the College
To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by
providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In
addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.
We also offer all self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free
monthly instalments over the academic year.
Students with non-traditional qualifications
We actively encourage students with non-traditional qualifications to study at Birkbeck. Our
outreach work, alongside the various entry routes to degree study, support students without
traditional entry qualifications to study successfully at Birkbeck. 25% of part-time entrants had
either level 2 (equivalent to GCSE), or lower entry qualifications in 2016/17 (2015/16: 35%).
83% of full-time entrants have low tariff or non-tariffable qualifications (source: Birkbeck
Teaching Excellence Framework 2 (TEF2) metrics). That a high proportion of students do not have
a level 3 qualification is a strong demonstration of our commitment to widening participation and
to facilitating social mobility.

Disability
We have a higher proportion of students eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) than our
HESA benchmark. We have the same proportion of full-time and part-time students eligible for
DSA and a slightly higher proportion of full-time students than part-time who declare a disability
to us. The proportion of students eligible for DSA dropped from 7.4% in 2015/16 to 6.8% in
2016/17.

Part-time students 6.8% 16%
Full-time students 6.8% 18%
Table 7: Proportion of Birkbeck students with a disability 2016/17
Ethnicity
The proportion of BAME students at Birkbeck is comparatively high at 46% of all undergraduate
students. The proportion on full-time programmes is higher still, at 56%. Our widening access
provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than focusing on ethnicity but as
our work is exclusively in London our approach means that we work with high numbers of
students from BAME groups. The proportion of Black students at Birkbeck is 8% higher than the
percentage that live in London (based on a 2011 survey from the Office for National Statistics),
whereas Asian students and White students are proportionally underrepresented.
London
Birkbeck students 2016/17 population Difference
Asian 12% 19% (6%)
Black 21% 13% 8%
White 13% 8% 4%
Other (incl mixed) 54% 60% (6%)
Table 8: Proportion of Birkbeck students by ethnicity 2016/17
Employability
In light of the fact that many of our students come from underrepresented backgrounds and with
low entry qualifications, our performance against ‘employment or further study’ benchmarks is
impressive. Despite achieving better results than the sector, we recognise that there remain gaps
in Black students’ employability success compared with White students. Through our Careers and
Employability service we have instigated projects to address this gap.

A major new project, Layers of London: mapping the city’s heritage, brings together digitised
heritage assets provided by key partners across London. The assets have been linked in an
innovative new website which allows people to interact with many different ‘layers’ of London’s

well as information about individual Londoners and families over the centuries. These layers will
be added to by the public, who will be able to upload historical information of different kinds.
The project was led by Professor Matthew Davies, Executive Dean of the School of Social
Sciences, History and Philosophy and was funded by a grant of £929,800 from the Heritage
Lottery Fund with an additional £600,000 from matched funding and other contributions. Other
partners on the project included the British Library, London Metropolitan Archives, Historic
England, The National Archives and MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology).
The advancement of health or saving of lives
An international consortium of 48 world-class universities and research institutes was awarded
the largest-ever grant in June 2018 to develop better treatment for autism by the Innovative
Medicines Initiative. The project will be academically led by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology
& Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, with the infant component of the project being
led by Birkbeck's Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development (CBCD).
The €115 million grant, titled Autism Innovative Medicine Studies-2-Trials (AIMS-2-Trials), will
increase understanding of autism and help develop new therapies to improve health outcomes
and quality of life for autistic people. Of this grant, Birkbeck will receive €2.8 million for projects
which will be led by Dr Emily Jones and Professor Mark Johnson.
The CBCD was also awarded a Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) pilot award,
which will fund a project focused on understanding how genetic variation influences early brain
development and results in autism symptoms in infants and toddlers. The Simons Foundation
aims to advance the frontiers of research in mathematics and sciences and supports research in
mathematics, theoretical physics, theoretical computer science, life sciences and autism
research initiatives.
The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of
religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity
In November 2017, Birkbeck’s Institute of Criminal Policy Research (ICPR) published the fourth
edition of the World Female Imprisonment List. It showed that the number of women and girls in
prison around the world had jumped by more than half since the turn of the century with more
than 714,000 women and girls now imprisoned globally. The male prison population increased
by around 20% in the same period.
The prison research at ICPR aims to bring about a deeper understanding of the many interwoven
factors that combine to drive increases in countries’ use of imprisonment and to find concrete,
practical solutions to end the unsustainable increases in imprisonment levels that we have seen
in recent history. To help with this, the research focuses on providing a much better account of
who it is that our states choose to imprison, and why.
Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO)
The latest data released by the Department of Education published in June 2018 demonstrates
how the College produces some of the UK’s highest-earning graduates with salaries way above
the average for universities just 12 months after completing studies. Based on the salaries of
those who graduated in 2013/14, it shows that one year after graduating Birkbeck graduates are
the ninth highest earners among UK institutions, and sixth highest in London, with an average
salary of £25.2K. Our graduates have consistently shown salary levels significant above the
average for UK’s universities in many areas with Psychology graduates earning the highest
median salaries of all UK psychology graduates a year after graduation, earning 36% more than
the median.

STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE GOVERNORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
In accordance with the Charter and Statutes of the College, the Governors are responsible for
exercising the powers of the College. Governors have oversight of the College's affairs and are
responsible for ensuring effective administration, management and internal control. The
Governing Body is required to present audited financial statements for each financial year.
The Governors act as the trustees of the College and are responsible for ensuring that proper
accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the College; and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements are prepared
in accordance with the College’s Charter and Statutes and the Statement of Recommended
Practice on Accounting for Further and Higher Education and FRS102: The financial reporting
standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. In addition, within the Terms and
Conditions of Funding for Higher Education Institutions set out by the Office for Students
(successor to the Higher Education Funding Council), the Governors, through the Master as the
accountable officer, are required to submit an annual accountability return including financial
statements which comply with the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction and give a true and fair
view of the College's state of affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses,
changes in reserves and cash flows for the year.
In causing the financial statements to be prepared, the Governors have ensured that:
• suitable accounting policies are selected and applied consistently;
• judgements and estimates are made that are reasonable and prudent;
• applicable accounting standards have been followed;
• financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the College will continue in operation; and
• they are satisfied that the College has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future (for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the
preparation of the financial statements).
The Governors have taken reasonable steps to:
• ensure that funds from the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Office for
Students and UK Research and Innovation are used only for the purposes for which they
have been given and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Funding for Higher
Education Institutions and any other terms and conditions which the OfS and UKRI may from
time to time prescribe;
• ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to safeguard
public funds and funds from other sources;
• safeguard the assets of the College and prevent and detect fraud; and
• secure the economical, efficient and effective management of the College’s resources and
expenditure.

STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE GOVERNORS' RESPONSIBILITIES (continued)
The key elements of the College’s system of internal financial control, which is designed to
discharge the responsibilities set out above, include the following:
• clear definitions of the responsibilities of, and the authority delegated to, Executive
Deans, Directors of Operation (Schools), Assistant Deans and Directors of Professional
Services;
• a comprehensive medium and short-term planning process, supplemented by detailed
annual income, expenditure, capital and cash flow budgets and forecasts;
• regular reviews of key performance indicators and business, operational, compliance and
sustainability risks and reports of variance from the annual income and expenditure
budget;
• clearly defined and formalised requirements for approval and control of expenditure, with
investment decisions involving capital or revenue expenditure being subject to formal
detailed appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the Governors;
• comprehensive Financial Regulations, detailing financial controls and procedures,
approved by the Audit Committee and Finance and General Purposes Committee; and
• a professional Internal Audit Service whose annual programme is approved by the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee receives reports on internal audit activity within the
College. The Chair of Audit Committee provides the Governors with reports on internal
audit activity and an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the College's system
of internal control, including internal financial control.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Corporate governance and accountability arrangements
Birkbeck College is a body incorporated by Royal Charter. Although the College does not have
shareholders, and is not a listed company, the Governing Body is committed to achieving high
standards of corporate governance in line with accepted best practice. This summary describes
the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in the UK Corporate
Governance Code insofar as they relate to universities. Its purpose is to help the reader of the
accounts understand how the principles have been applied.
The Governing Body
The Governing Body (“Governors”) comprises independent members, students, alumni and
employees appointed under the Statutes of the College, the majority of whom are non-executive.
There is a majority of independent members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the
Governing Body are separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.
The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and
Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities. The Governing
Body is responsible for the ongoing strategic direction of the College, approval of major
developments and the receipt of regular reports from Senior Management on the day to day
operations of its business.
The Governing Body is responsible for the College's system of internal control and for reviewing
its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including
Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and
Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of
reference. All independent members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the
Governors on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.
The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE
and the Committee for University Chairs (CUC) for regular effectiveness reviews. The review
concluded that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in
place measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more
opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings. In 2016/17
four new independent governors were appointed following an open call for expressions of
interest, which increased the diversity of the Governing Body.
The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of
Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. In 2018
the Governing Body agreed changes to the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference and
reporting protocol, to increase transparency and accountability in line with new guidance from
the CUC. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's
processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code. The Governing Body has
approved, and annually reviews, a set of Key Performance Indicators linked to College strategic
objectives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
The Governing Body is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the College's significant risks, linked to the achievement of strategic objectives, that
the process has been in place for the year ended 31 July 2018 and up to the date of approval of
the annual accounts, that it is regularly reviewed by the Governing Body and that it accords with
the internal control guidance for directors in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the
principles in the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.
Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee
On all academic matters the Governors must consider, but not necessarily follow, the advice of
the Academic Board, which is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the
College. The Academic Board has a membership of around 150 drawn almost entirely from
academic staff and the students of the College and chaired by the Master. It delegates some of
its powers to its Executive Committee.
Finance and General Purposes Committee
The Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&GPC) reviews and then recommends to the
Governors the College’s annual revenue and capital budgets and monitors performance in
relation to the approved budgets. It reviews and then recommends to Governors the financial
regulations and financial policies that are applied to management. It reviews the annual financial
statements and considers financial strategy. In addition, the Investment Committee is
responsible for the College investments on behalf of F&GPC.
The Finance and General Purposes Committee met three times during the year.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee considers nominations for independent member vacancies in the
Governing Body membership under the relevant Statute and for Governing Body appointed
vacancies on College Committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into account the
balance of skills, knowledge and experience of members and are based on assessment against
objective criteria. It also considers issues of succession planning and diversity within the
Governing Body.
The Nominations Committee met once during the year.
Remuneration Committee
In 2017/18 the Remuneration Committee determined the annual remuneration of the Master
and of professorial and senior administrative staff. Independent members of Governing Body
receive no remuneration for their services although expenses incurred in attending meetings are
met by the College. Members of the Governing Body who are employees of the College receive no
additional remuneration for their services to the Governing Body. The cost of living salary
increases for all staff are determined by national pay negotiations for all universities. The
employee members have no involvement in determining their own salaries.
The Remuneration Committee met three (2016/17: one) times during the year. As well as its
existing business of setting senior staff remuneration, it considered the Committee for University
Chairs’ new guidance on remuneration committees, and in response has recommended revisions
to its terms of reference. The revisions include confirmation that the Committee’s membership is
wholly independent and does not include any College staff, a focus on remuneration of the core
senior team, a stronger link between remuneration and individual and institutional performance,
and more extensive and transparent reporting of the Committee’s decisions.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
These were approved by the Governing Body and the revised terms of reference will be in
operation from 2018/19.
Remuneration Committee also considered the requirements in the OfS Accounts Direction for
these financial statements to include a justification for the total remuneration package for the
Master and a pay multiple ratio expressing the relationship between the Master’s remuneration
and that for all other employees. It has agreed these elements, which are in note 7 of the
financial statements, noting that they have been produced retrospectively and relate to decisions
made during the reporting period.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises wholly independent members drawn from the Governing Body so
has no executive responsibility. Members have recent, relevant financial and other appropriate
experience. The Audit Committee met four times during the year.
The Audit Committee relies substantially on the work of the internal and external auditors, on the
information provided by management and the response of management to the questions it
raises.
The remit of the Audit Committee includes:
• reviewing the effectiveness of the College’s systems of internal control and risk
management;
• satisfying itself and assuring the Governors that satisfactory arrangements are in place to
promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness thereby securing value for money;
• reviewing and approving the remit of the internal audit function;
• advising the Governors, as necessary, on the appointment and remuneration of the
internal and external auditors, and their quality, reliability and effectiveness;
• reviewing with the external auditors the scope and nature of the audit, including the
report to Audit Committee written by the external auditors; and
• assessing compliance with the HE regulatory framework.
The external and internal auditors have a standing arrangement to meet with the Audit
Committee regularly without senior officers present. The auditors also attend meetings with
senior officers to consider the items listed above and to review plans for the audit process.
The College’s internal audit function provides, by undertaking review, independent objective
assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk
management framework and the design and effectiveness of the operation of internal controls
that are intended to control critical business application risks. Internal audit also helps the
College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating
and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by
working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by
internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews
are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate
action confirmed to the Audit Committee. The head of the internal audit has unfettered access to
the Audit Committee.
The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the
Audit Committee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
Audit Committee (continued)
The senior management team and the Audit Committee receive regular reports, including value
for money reports, from internal audit which include recommendations for improvement. The
Audit Committee's role in this area is to carry out a high level review of the arrangements for
internal financial control. The Audit Committee and the Strategic Planning Committee review risk
and control during the annual compilation of the risk register and report to the Governing Body.
The Audit Committee also reports on the effectiveness of the College’s management of risks to
the Governing Body each term. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance
and not merely reporting by exception. At its summer 2018 meeting, the Governing Body
approved the risk management report for 2017/18 and the risk register for 2018/19, taking into
account reports from College management and the Audit Committee. In November 2018 the
Governing Body considered and approved the annual report of the Audit Committee on its work
during 2017/18, including a report from the internal auditor.
Strategic Planning Committee
The Strategic Planning Committee consists of College officers with strategic management
responsibility. Its remit is to consider College-wide strategic issues and priorities and to advise
Governors accordingly. It is responsible for internal planning and resource allocation policy and
procedures. It oversees the annual planning and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools
and Professional Services on developing plans and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for
presentation to Finance and General Purposes Committee.
The Strategic Planning Committee met nine times during the year.
The membership of all of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-6.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2018
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the College”) for the
year ended 31 July 2018 which comprise the Consolidated and College Statement of
Comprehensive Income and Expenditure, Consolidated and College Statement of Changes in
Reserves, the Consolidated and College Balance Sheets and related notes, including the
accounting policies.
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the College’s affairs as at 31 July
2018, and of the Group’s and the College’s income and expenditure, gains and losses
and changes in reserves, and of the Group’s cash flows, for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS
102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland, and
with the 2015 Statement of Recommended Practice – Accounting for Further and Higher
Education; and
• meet the requirements of the Accounts Direction dated 19 June 2018 issued by the
Office for Students
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities under, and are independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.
Going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of
accounting is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast
significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of
approval of the financial statements. We have nothing to report in these respects.
Other information
The Board of Governors is responsible for the other information, which comprises the Operating
and financial review and Corporate Governance Statement. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on
our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or
inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work, we
have not identified material misstatements in the other information.
Board of Governors responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 32 and 33, the Board of Governors is
responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give
a true and fair view; such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
assessing the group and parent College’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless it either intends to liquidate the group or the parent College or to cease operations, or has
no realistic alternative but to do so.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
We are required to report on the following matters under the Office for Students and Research
England Audit Codes of Practice issued under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
In our opinion, in all material respects:
• funds from whatever source administered by the Group or the College for specific
purposes have been properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with
relevant legislation;
• funds provided by the Office for Students and Research England have been applied in
accordance with the terms and conditions attached to them; and
• funds provided by HEFCE have been applied in accordance with the Memorandum of
Assurance and Accountability and any other terms and conditions attached to them.
THE PURPOSE OF OUR AUDIT WORK AND TO WHOM WE OWE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
This report is made solely to the Board of Governors, in accordance with Charters and Statutes of
the institution. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of
Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the College and the Board of Governors for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.

Birkbeck, University of London
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2018
Statement of Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 July 2018
1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2015 and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
2. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to 31
July 2018. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union
as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
3. Income recognition
Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms
of the contract have been satisfied.
Fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the Consolidated
Statement of Income and Comprehensive Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.
Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is
shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not
deducted from income.
Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure
on a receivable basis.
Grant funding
Government revenue grants, including funding council teaching and research grants, are recognised as
income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended
to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income within
creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more than one year as
appropriate.
Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received in
advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors
and released to income as the conditions are met.

3. Income recognition (continued)
Donations and endowments
Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is
utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to the
terms applied to the individual endowment fund.
There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
a) Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective;
b) Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
invested to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College;
c) Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
to generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
Capital grants
Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the College has
satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
4. Accounting for retirement benefits
College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
(USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
professionally qualified independent actuaries.
Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
contribution retirement benefit schemes.
A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
schemes.

4. Accounting for retirement benefits (continued)
Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Defined benefit plan
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine
its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
5. Employment benefits
Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are
accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused
entitlement.
6. Finance leases
Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.

7. Service concession arrangements
Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
financial liability.
Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
arrangement.
8. Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.
9. Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
year.
10. Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
assets.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.
The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
depreciated as follows:
Buildings: 40 to 100 years
Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years
Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years
Leasehold land: the life of the lease
Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.

10. Fixed assets (continued)
Equipment
Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
equipment is capitalised.
Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
lives are as follows:
- Computer hardware: 3 years
- Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
- Other equipment: 3 to 5 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
Balance Sheet.
11. Heritage assets
Works of art and other valuable artefacts have been capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of
the acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not
depreciated as their long economic life means that any depreciation would not be material.
12. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
software implementations are treated as intangible assets with depreciation commencing once the initial
phase of development is complete.
13. Investments
Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
year.
14. Stock
Stock is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value and is measured using an average cost
formula.

15. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts. Deposits are repayable on
demand if they are available within 24 hours without penalty.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
of cash with insignificant change in value.
16. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:
a) The College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
b) It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
A contingent liability arises from a past event that gives the College a possible obligation whose existence
will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly within the
control of the College. Contingent liabilities also arise in circumstances where a provision would otherwise
be made but either it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent asset arises where an event has taken place that gives the College a possible asset whose
existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the College.
Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the notes.
17. Taxation
The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is
potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered
by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable
purposes.
The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
cost.
The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial
organisation.

18. Reserves
Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
must hold in perpetuity.
Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.

Along with all other staff of the College, the Master received the national pay award of 1.7% from August
2017.
The Governors agreed alternate pension arrangements for the Master in 2016/17. The College continues
to contribute 2.1% of salary towards the USS pension deficit - the same percentage as for all members of
the scheme.
The Master's basic salary is 9.0 times (2016/17: 9.0) the median pay of staff, where the median basic
salary is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis for the basic pay of all staff.
The Master's total remuneration is 9.2 times (2016/17: 9.7) the median total remuneration of staff,
where the median total remuneration is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis for the total
remuneration of all staff.
In calculating the basic salary and total remuneration ratios we have taken the transitional option to
exclude agency and atypical workers' salaries as the systems and processes do not currently categorise
information in a way that meets this new requirement.

Remuneration of the Master
The Master’s remuneration has been determined and reviewed through appropriate and robust processes in
terms of independence, objectivity, and assessment of individual and overall institutional performance.
Remuneration Committee
The Master’s remuneration has been set and reviewed by a remuneration panel comprised of independent
Governors. The panel includes the Chair of Governors, but in accordance with good practice, is chaired by
another independent Governor. The Master is not a member of this panel and does not attend or participate
in its meetings or business. The panel is supported by the College Secretary & Clerk to the Governors and,
additionally, advice is provided, or commissioned, by the Director of Human Resources.
Process
• The panel reviews the remuneration of the Master annually in the light of the following information:
• Sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other sources for a range of
relevant comparator institutions.
• Retention and continuity of senior leadership through a period of profound challenge and transformation
for the College has been a priority, thus additional institutions have been added to the benchmarking
profile to support objective consideration of retention issues.
• The outcome of the Master’s annual appraisal conducted by the Chair of Governors. This is a formal
documented process in which annual objectives are set and performance against those objectives are
reviewed.
• The broader context provided by institutional performance information and institutional KPIs agreed by
Governors.
Outcomes
The Master last received an increase in base salary, over and above the level of the national pay award, in
2012. He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. The Master’s current salary reflects sustained quality
and continuity of leadership over a 15 year period which has had transformational impact. The College has
met, managed and overcome major strategic threats - the loss of 40% of core teaching funding due to
government policy change in 2007 and the fundamental 60% decline in traditional part-time study post
2012. The College’s distinct mission stands out in the sector: widening access, opportunity and flexibility for
students in an environment informed by the best research. Birkbeck is one of only twenty UK institutions
that rate highly in both REF and TEF. Delivering successfully on its mission in this environment has required
the College to restructure, reposition, re-invent and innovate. The Master’s role in delivering this change,
operating in a long-standing, collegial environment, building the widest base of support amongst students,
staff, stakeholders and funders, has been vital to the viability and success of the College.

Governing Body
The College governors are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the College's
operations and the compositions of the Council, being drawn from local public and private sector
organisations, transactions may take place with organisations in which a governor may have an interest.
No such transactions have taken place during the year (2016/17: none).
None of the governors received any remuneration or waived payments from the group during the year
(2016/17: none).
Two governors received a total of £576 (2016/17: £440, three governors) representing the
reimbursement of travel expenses incurred in attending meetings and events in their official capacity.

The obligation to fund the past deficits on the pension schemes arises from the contractual relationship with
the schemes for total payments relating to benefits arising from past performance. Management have
estimated the number of future employees within the pension schemes and the salary payments made to
the employees over the period of the contracted obligation when assessing the value of this provision.

26 Related party transactions
All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any
significant personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the
composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations) it
is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of staff
may have an interest. All transactions are conducted at arms length in accordance with the financial
regulations of the College.
Included in the financial statements are the following transactions between the College and related parties.

27 Pension schemes (continued)
(i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)
Prior to 31 March 2016, the scheme was a defined benefit only scheme which was contracted out of the
State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the
S2P. A defined contribution section was introduced in October 2016. The fund is independently
administered by trustees. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not hypothecated to
individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The College is, therefore, exposed to
actuarial risks associated with the employees of other institutions and is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Consequently, and as
required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the College accounts for the scheme as if it were a
defined contribution scheme.
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists
of a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer
scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide
scheme such as that provided by USS. The members of USS have entered into an agreement with the
scheme trustees which determines how they will fund the net pension deficit in the scheme. The accounting
principles pertaining to multi-employer schemes require the College to recognise the contributions payable
that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) as a liability in the Balance
Sheet. The resulting expense is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.
College governors are satisfied that the scheme provided by USS meets the definition of a multi-employer
scheme and have, therefore, recognised as a liability the discounted fair value of the contractual
contributions under the funding plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation
date”). The valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. The valuation as at 31 March 2017
is underway but not yet completed. Since the College cannot identify its share of the scheme assets and
liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for the scheme as a whole.
In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its
obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). The recovery
plan in the 2014 actuarial valuation requires employers to contribute 2.1% of salaries towards repairing the
deficit over a period of 17 years, of which 14 years remain.
The 2017 actuarial valuation of USS has been undertaken but this has not yet formerly completed. The
2017 valuation has set out the challenges currently facing the scheme and the likelihood of significant
increases in contributions being required to address these challenges.
In the judgement of the College, as the 2017 valuation has not formerly completed, and there remains
various stages of consultation around the key factors specifically relating to the funding of the past deficit,
including the level of contributions required, the period of the recovery plan and the level of asset
performance over the period, it remains appropriate to continue to account for the past deficit obligation in
accordance with the plan agreed after the 2014 actuarial valuation.
However, there is a significant risk that the year-end provision as calculated will not reflect the position
following the outcome of negotiations, potentially by a very significant amount depending upon what is
finally agreed as regards to future deficit contributions and their duration. The College expects to have
greater clarity in this respect during the next financial year.

27 Pension schemes (continued)
The 2014 valuation was the third valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime
introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to
have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of
the assets of the scheme was £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9
billion. This results in a net shortfall of £5.3 billion. These figures will be revised once the 2017 Scheme
Valuation is complete.
The defined benefit liability for the scheme has been produced using the following assumptions:
2018 2017
Discount rate 2.6% 2.6%
Pensionable salary growth n/a n/a
Pension increases 2.0% 2.4%
Mortality in retirement is assumed to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S1NA
tables as follows:
Male members’ mortality: 98% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – no age rating
Female members’ mortality: 99% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – rated down 1 year
Use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience. To allow for further
improvements in mortality rates the CMI 2014 projections with a 1.5% pa long term rate were also adopted.
The current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:
2018 2017
Males currently aged 65 24.5 24.4
Females currently aged 65 26.0 26.6
Males currently aged 45 26.5 26.5
Females currently aged 45 27.8 29.0
Financial data for the scheme can be summarised as follows:
2018 2017
Total scheme assets £63.6bn £60.0bn
Total scheme liabilities £72.0bn £77.5bn
FRS 102 total scheme deficit £8.4bn £17.5bn
FRS 102 total funding level 88.0% 77.0%

27 Pension schemes (continued)
(ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)
The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the
State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the
S2P.
SAUL is an independently managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
institutions with links to higher education.
Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on either a final salary basis or a career average
revalued earnings (“CARE”) basis. Following a consultation with members, it was agreed that the final salary
section would close from 31 March 2016 and all members would subsequently build up benefits on a CARE
basis.
The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations
under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the
amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.
SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The trustees adopt
assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits
already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from members’ accrued
pension rights to be met.
The assumptions used to calculate the Technical Provisions include appropriate margins to allow for the
possibility of events turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not
completely remove the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the
future.
A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.
Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.
The funding principles were reviewed at SAUL’s next formal valuation in 2017. The valuation confirmed that
there is no deficit to correct and as a result no further recovery plan contributions or provision is required.
The trustees and employers agreed that the Technical Provisions deficit at the 31 March 2014 valuation will
be addressed by employer contributions of 3% of salaries between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2018
(inclusive). As a result the overall level of the employers’ contributions increased from 13% of salaries to
16% of salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.
