          It has been another active and innovative year for learning and teaching at Aston. This has
          been particularly energised by the arrival of a new Director of Learning Innovation and
          Professional Practice , Professor Paul Bartholomew. He, and his new team, have
          embedded themselves well to work in partnership with the Schools. They have redesigned
          our Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Practice and Aston Certificate, and more staff
                                                                                  
          than ever before have achieved these awards. The Centre for Learning Innovation and
          Professional Practice (CLIPP) team have also developed new proposals for Curriculum
          Design, a Distance Learning Strategy, and a Student Engagement Strategy. In addition,
          they have led our Research Informed Teaching Evaluation (RITE) programme, which is
          accredited by the Higher Education Academy to award Fellowships, Senior Fellowships and
          Principal Fellowships. As a result of these two initiatives we have double the national
          average of HEA Fellows.                                                 
                                                                                  
          In addition, two of our staff were awarded prestigious HEA National Teaching Fellowships
          this year: Professor Helen Higson and Odette Hutchinson, both of Aston Business School.

          Last year we reported a strong improvement in the National Student Survey (NSS). This
          year we have maintained this level of achievement (89% overall satisfaction) boosted by
          significant further improvements in Engineering.                        
          Much of our work this year has been in developing the role and recognition of Programme
          Directors. Our design and coordination of high quality learning, as well as the annual
          monitoring process is now programme-based.                              
          Following from our activities last year, we are pleased to report a number of successes,
          including the following: two of our (Conceive, Design, Innovate, Operate) CDIO teams in
          Mechanical Engineering came top in the annual international CDIO competition; we have
          placed more students into placements than ever before, particularly in Science and
          Engineering; our Student Job Shop has been rated top amongst our Students’ Union

          These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the statement of
          recommended practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2007 and in
          accordance with applicable Accounting Standards. They conform to guidance published by

          extent of the equivalent expenditure incurred during the year and any related contributions
          towards overhead costs; any payments received in advance of such performance are
          recognised on the balance sheet as liabilities. Income from short-term deposits is credited to
          the income and expenditure account in the period in which it is earned. 
                                                                                  
          Income from endowments is credited to the income and expenditure account in the period in
          which it is earned. Income from restricted endowments not expended in accordance with the
          restrictions of the endowment, is transferred from the income and expenditure to restricted
          endowments. Any realised gains or losses from dealing in the related assets are retained
          within the endowment in the balance sheet.                              
                                                                                  
          Donations with restrictions are recognised when relevant conditions have been met; in many
          cases recognition is directly related to expenditure incurred on specific purposes, donations
          which are to be retained for the benefit of the institution are recognised in the statement of
                                                                                  
          total recognised gains and losses and in endowments; other donations are recognised by
          inclusion as other income in the income and expenditure account.

          Recurrent grants from the Funding Councils are recognised in the period in which they are
          receivable.                                                             
                                                                                  
          Non-recurrent grants from Funding Councils or other bodies are recognised in the period in
          which they are received, unless the grant terms require the grant to be matched to specific
          expenditure, in which case the income is recognised to the extent of the equivalent
          expenditure during the year.                                            
                                                                                  
          Non-recurrent grants from Funding Councils or other bodies received in respect of the
          acquisition or construction of fixed assets are treated as deferred capital grants and
          amortised in line with depreciation over the life of the assets.

          The University has a ten-year rolling long-term maintenance plan, which forms the basis of
          the on-going maintenance of the estate. The cost of long term and routine corrective
          maintenance is charged to the income and expenditure account as incurred.

          currencies are translated into sterling at year-end rates. The resulting exchange differences
          are dealt with in the determination of income and expenditure for the financial year.

          Retirement benefits for most employees of the University are provided by The Universities
          Superannuation Scheme (USS) and Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). These are
          defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted out of the State Second
          Pension. The University also had one member in the Local Government Pension Scheme
          (LGPS) who retired in 2012-13. Until 2011-12, this scheme has been accounted for as a
                                                                                  
          defined contribution scheme. In 2011-12 the University reviewed this policy, and decided to
          account for the scheme as a defined benefit scheme.                     
                                                                                  
          Contributions to USS are charged to the income and expenditure account so as to spread
          the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the University in such a way that the
          pension cost is a substantially level percentage of present and future pensionable payroll.
          Variations from regular costs are spread over the expected average remaining working
          lifetime of members of the schemes after making allowances for further withdrawals. The
          contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using
          a prospective benefit method.

          In accordance with FRS 17 Accounting for Retirement Benefits, the assets of AUPS are
          measured using market values for the current year. Liabilities are measured using the
          projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate
          bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. The increase in the present value of the
          liabilities of the scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to
          the operating surplus. The expected return on the scheme’s assets and the increase during
          the period in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities, arising from the passage of time,
          are included in pension finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the
                                                                                  
          statement of total recognised gains and losses.                         
          Further details of the pension schemes are given in note 32.            
                                                                                  
          Tangible fixed assets                                                   
                                                                                  
          Land and Buildings                                                      
                                                                                  
          Land and buildings are included in the Balance Sheet at valuation as at 1 August 1994, with
          subsequent additions at cost. The valuation was performed by Chartered Surveyors DTZ
          Debenham Thorpe on the basis of depreciated replacement cost for the main campus
          together with open market value for properties off-campus. The total valuation at the time
                                                                                  
          amounted to £52.8 million and the resulting £41.1 million excess over net book value was
          taken to the Revaluation Reserve. On disposal, any valuation surplus realised is transferred
          from the Revaluation Reserve to the Income and Expenditure account.     
                                                                                  
          Land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful life. New buildings,
          including extensions, are depreciated over their expected useful lives of 40 years, major
          building renovation and conversion is depreciated over 20 years and general building
          improvements are depreciated over 10 years.                             
                                                                                  
          Where buildings are acquired with the aid of specific grants they are capitalised and
          depreciated as above. The related grants are treated as deferred capital grants in the
          Balance Sheet and released to income over the expected useful life of the buildings.
                                                                                  
          Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of land and buildings have
          been capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.                   
                                                                                  
          A review for impairment of a fixed asset is carried out if events or changes in circumstances
          indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
                                                                                  
          Buildings under construction are accounted for at cost, based on the value of architects’
          certificates and other direct costs incurred to 31 July. They are not depreciated until they are
          brought into use.                                                       
                                                                                  
          In accordance with FRS 15 the University has opted to take the one-off opportunity to freeze
          the valuations at the date of the implementation of FRS 15 for the first time.

          Capitalised equipment is depreciated over its useful economic life as follows:

          Where equipment is acquired with the aid of specific grants it is capitalised and depreciated
          in accordance with the above policy, with the related grant being credited to a deferred
          capital grant account and released to income and expenditure account over the expected
          useful economic life of the related equipment.                          
                                                                                  
          Leased assets                                                           
                                                                                  
          Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
                                                                                  
          Leasing agreements that transfer to the University substantially all the benefits and risks of
          ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets
          are included in fixed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as
          obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and
          interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and
          the interest element is charged to the income and expenditure account in proportion to the
          reducing capital element outstanding. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated
          over the shorter of the lease term or the useful economic lives of equivalent owned assets.
                                                                                  
          Assets which are held under hire purchase contracts which have the characteristics of
          finance leases are depreciated over their useful lives.                 
                                                                                  
          Heritage assets                                                         
                                                                                  
          The University does not hold any heritage assets. However in the event that these are
          acquired then assets costing or valued at over £10,000 would be capitalised at cost or value
          on acquisition, where such a valuation is reasonably obtainable. Other heritage assets
                                                                                  
          would not be capitalised.                                               
          Intangible Assets                                                       
                                                                                  
          The University will capitalise intangible assets costing or valued at over £10,000 upon

          Investment property is accounted for in accordance with SSAP 19 where the property is

          Stocks are stated at the lower of their cost and net realisable value. Where necessary,

          The University is an exempt charity within the meaning of schedule 3 of the Charities Act
          2012 (formerly schedule 2 of the Charities Act 1993) and is considered to pass the tests set
                                                                                  
          out in Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 Finance Act 2011 and therefore meets the definition of a
          charitable company for UK corporation tax purposes. Accordingly, the University is
          potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within
          categories covered by section 287 CTA2009 and sections 471, and 478-488 CTA 2011
          (formerly section 505 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) or section 256 of the
          Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied
          to exclusively charitable purposes.                                     
                                                                                  
          The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable
          VAT on inputs is included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to
          tangible fixed assets is included in their cost.                        
                                                                                  
          Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the
          balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates
          expected to apply when they crystallise based on current rates and law. Timing differences
                                                                                  
          arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in
          periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax
          assets are recognised to the extent they are regarded as more likely than not that they will
          be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.   
                                                                                  
          The University’s subsidiary companies are subject to corporation tax and VAT in the same
          way as any commercial organisation.

          to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

               The long-term loan comprises a term loan of £40 million with rates of interest
               negotiated at the time of draw down. The loan is payable in quarterly instalments
               from 2008 to 2037. This loan is secured on a building of the University. The weighted
               average interest rate for these loans was 3.84% per annum.         
                                                                                  
               In March 2014 the University concluded negotiations with the West Midlands Pension
                                                                                  
               Fund to repay a deficit arising on leaving the scheme over a period of 6 years. The
               payment will be £426,000 p.a. funded partly by the provision made in 2012/13 with
               interest being charged to the income and expenditure account.      
                                                                                  
               In February 2014 the University purchased the land at Fisher Triangle from
               Birmingham City Council having previously held a leasehold interest over the land.
               The first cash transfer has been made but the Council retains a charge over the
               property until March 2017 when the University will pay a further sum of £490,000 to

               At the year end, capital commitments for items contracted for but not yet received by
               the University amounted to £2,390,066 (2013-14: £9,104,829).       
                                                                                  
               The University has a Section 278 Highways Act 1980 bond with Birmingham City
               Council for £31,282. This bond relates to the carrying out of works to Aston Street,
               Birmingham. In the event that the University fail to meet the terms of the Section 278
               agreement the bond will be paid to Birmingham City Council.        
                                                                                  
               As the result of an enquiry by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), a building which is
                                                                                  
               owned by the University and in which its subsidiary Conference Aston Limited trades
               could be revalued for business rates purposes. At the date of approval of these
               financial statements, this enquiry is ongoing. Were a revaluation to take place it
               would lead to a change in the business rates payable by the Group for the current
               year, and potentially prior years, the level of which cannot be known or reliably
               estimated at the date of approval of these financial statements. If higher business
               rates were to be payable this would reduce the income and expenditure account and
               increase the creditors balance in the Group balance sheet.

          26. Related party transactions                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               Due to the nature of the University’s operations and the members of Council being
               drawn from local, public and private sector organisations, it is inevitable that
               transactions will take place with organisations in which a member of Council or a
               member of the senior management team may have an interest.         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               All such transactions, including those identified below, are conducted at arm’s length
               and in accordance with the University’s Financial Regulations and normal
               procurement procedures.                                            
                                                                                  
               The University has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 8 (Related Party
               Disclosures) and has not disclosed transactions with subsidiaries that are wholly
               owned.                                                             
                                                                                  
               Related parties were identified by examining returns submitted by members of
                                                                                  
               Council and senior management team members for the financial year 2013-14, as
               well as performing an online check via Creditsafe.                 
                                                                                  
               These financial statements include the following transactions with related parties. No
               information has been listed for organisations where the income and expenditure is
               less than £200,000 in the financial year.

          32. Pension schemes                                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          The two principal pension schemes for the University's staff are the Universities
          Superannuation Scheme (USS) and the Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). USS
          provides benefits based on final pensionable salary for academic and academic-related
          employees of all UK universities and other employees. AUPS provides similarly calculated
          benefits for other staff of the University. Whilst all of these schemes are defined benefit
          schemes, for the reasons explained below USS is accounted for as if it were a defined
          contribution scheme. For the other schemes FRS17 requires the deficit in the scheme to be
          reflected in the accounts and the movements in the deficit to be reflected partly as a pension
          cost in the Income and Expenditure account and partly in the Statement of Total Recognised

Notes To The Financial Statements                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          32. Pension schemes  continued                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          USS                                                                     
                                                                                  
          The institution participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (USS), a
          defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and contracted out of the State Second
          Pension (S2P). The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
          The institution is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the
          scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17
          “Retirement benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
          As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure account represents the
          contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
                                                                                  
          The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 which has not
          yet been finalised at the time of the production of these accounts. This was the third
          valuation for USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act
          2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have
          sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions.  
                                                                                  
          The triennial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. The assumptions
          which have the most significant effect of the result of the valuation are those relating to the
          rate of return on investments (i.e. the valuation rate of interest), the rates of increase in
          salary and pensions and the assumed rates of morality. The financial assumptions were
          derived from market yields prevailing at the valuation date. A snapshot for the period at 31
          March 2013 reported £11.5 billion deficit between the scheme’s estimated assets and
          liabilities. The contribution rate will be reviewed as part of each valuation and may be
          reviewed more frequently.                                               
                                                                                  
          The technical provisions relate essentially to the past service liabilities and funding levels,
          but it is also necessary to assess the ongoing cost of newly accruing benefits. The cost of
          future accrual was calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the
          technical provisions but the allowance for promotional salary increases was not as high.
          Analysis has shown very variable levels of growth over and above general pay increases in
          recent years, and the salary growth assumption built into the cost of future accrual is based
          on more stable, historic, salary experience.                            
          As at the valuation date the Scheme had moved to be a career revalued scheme for new
          entrants but remains a fully final salary scheme for qualifying members and the prevailing
          employer contribution rate was 16% of Salaries.                         
                                                                                  
          Following UK government legislation, from 2011 statutory pension increases or revaluations
          are based on the Consumer Prices Index measure of price inflation. Historically these
          increases had been based on the Retail Prices Index measure of prices inflation.

          Since the valuation effective date, there have been a number of changes to the benefits
          provided by the scheme although these became effective from October 2011. These
          include:

          Other than in specific, limited circumstances, new entrants are now provided on a Career

          The normal pension age was increased for future service and new entrants to age 65.

          If the total contribution level exceeds 23.5% of Salaries per annum, the employers will pay
          65% of the excess over 23.5% and members would pay the remaining 35% to the fund as
          additional contributions.

          For service derived after 30 September 2011, the USS will match increases in official
          pensions for the first 5%. If pensions increase by more than 5% then USS will pay half of
          the difference up to a maximum increase of 10%.                         
                                                                                  
          At 31 March 2014, USS had over 167,000 active members and there were 947 active
          members at Aston participating in the scheme.The total pension cost for the group was
          £9,347,000 (2013: £8,450,000). This includes £13,000 (2013: £19,000) outstanding
          contributions at the balance sheet date. The contribution rate payable by the institution was
          16% of pensionable salaries. The next formal triennial actuarial valuation is due as at 31
          March 2017.

          The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The Scheme is
          a defined benefit scheme which is funded and valued every three years by the actuary
                                                                                  
          using the projected unit method, the rates of contribution payable being determined by the
          trustees on the advice of the actuary. A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 April
          2013 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes by a qualified independent actuary. The
          material assumptions and other data used by the actuary were:

          The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of possible
          actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne
          out in practice.                                                        
                                                                                  
          The FRS 17 valuation has used RPI as the inflationary index to calculate scheme liabilities
          for current members and used CPI in respect of deferred members.        
                                                                                  
          The current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in the
          mortality rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement age are:

          From 1 August 2013, the University is required to automatically enrol its workers into a
          workplace pension scheme if they meet certain qualifying criteria, which are explained below
                                                                                  
          and are not members of any other scheme. The University is allowed to postpone assessing
          its workers, to see if they meet the criteria for enrolment, for up to three months from the 1
          August 2013 or the commencement of employment, if later. It can also postpone the
          automatic enrolment from the date the automatic enrolment criteria are first met, providing
          that this is not at the end of an earlier postponement period. The University may use
          postponement.
