Most of our students are mature and\n          have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The age of our students ranges from 18\n          to 80 and our student body is diverse with 40% from BAME backgrounds and 58% women. As\n          well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing international student community now\n          welcoming students from 120 countries around the world.                 \n                                                                                  \n          Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that\n          proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was\n          successful in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) return with 83% of our research\n          being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). In terms of national\n          higher education quality assessments, we are one of the minority of institutions that rate highly\n          both for REF and for TEF, the teaching excellence framework.            \n          Student Recruitment                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          Last year’s report highlighted a positive recruitment position during the Covid period. New\n          admissions totalled 4,819 FTE, the highest for a decade. Whilst for many the pandemic disrupted\n          careers, livelihoods, and businesses for others it also created time and opportunity to return to\n          study in 2020/21. There was also a significant EU effect with a rush to start programmes before\n          the right to loan funding was removed. The report pointed to significant challenges ahead and\n          this has been the case. New admissions in 2021/22 were 3,493 FTE compared to this high point\n          the previous year.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n          Applications in 2021/22 held at roughly the same level as 2020/21 where we had our highest\n          level of applications ever. The significant issue was the change in the makeup of those\n          applications. Increases in younger school and college leavers in UCAS and international\n          applications were key components of our strategy, particularly in relation to the impact of Brexit.\n          However, in parallel with that, from Easter to the end of the recruitment cycle in the autumn,\n          applications from 21–60-year-old London and UK based mature learners seeking to return to\n          formal education alongside work and other commitments dropped significantly. The College\n          received over 2,500 fewer applications from this group compared with the high point in 2020/21\n          when applications were just over 10,000.                                \n          This was not simply a Birkbeck impact, but a national one, with UCAS reporting major drops in\n          ‘mature returners’ throughout the recruitment cycle. Some of the impact is related to the\n          situation in 2020/21 and the extent to which it brought forward and concentrated demand that\n          would otherwise have been spread over a number of years. The mature learner journey from\n          considering returning to study to starting that study can often take several years. A major factor\n          though is a post-pandemic one, reflecting new and emerging patterns of work in London and\n          across the UK, as well as the immediate and challenging circumstances that potentially stand in\n          the way of mature learners committing to study at this point.           \n                                                                                  \n          At Birkbeck applications from over 21-year-olds convert into enrolments at a much higher rate\n          (35-50% depending on mode and level of study) than those from school/college leavers (10-\n          15%) and international students (5-10%) and this is the primary factor impacting the final\n          enrolment figure. Individual conversion rates for demographic group/mode and level of study\n          remained largely unchanged in this cycle but the shift in the overall admissions mix led to a much\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

A\n          key strand of the college’s new strategy, outlined below, is to make changes to the Birkbeck offer\n          in terms of campus experience, teaching delivery, and student outcomes especially around\n          employability. In time these will allow us to capitalise on growing interest from younger commuter\n          students in London, international students, and increase conversion from these two groups.\n          There has been a significant Brexit impact on recruitment as we highlighted in reporting last year.\n          The focus of our recruitment has been EU nationals living and working in the UK, rather than\n          direct recruitment from EU countries. Direct recruitment from EU countries, with the implication\n          this brings of higher fees and no loan support, has dramatically declined. Recruitment from EU\n          nationals based in the UK has held up better but has been impacted by the general factors\n          affecting mature learners that have been highlighted already.           \n                                                                                  \n          A very clear part of our strategy post-Brexit has been to focus on and significantly increase\n          international recruitment and it is encouraging to report significant progress here. International\n          recruitment is up significantly (39% on 2020/21 and 22% on 2019/20) and we now have more\n          students from India, China and Saudi Arabia in particular, leading to our highest ever\n          international student number levels. As well as growth at postgraduate Masters level where\n          international recruitment has been previously concentrated we had an increased cohort of\n          international undergraduates.                                           \n                                                                                  \n          The recruitment picture for 2022/23 has remained challenging. Whilst new admissions have not\n          declined further and are set to be in the region of 3,500 FTE, the trends and factors highlighted\n          above have continued to play out. The long-term national factors driving down participation in\n          higher education by mature learners that have resulted from poor maintenance support and\n          older students’ aversion to the debt associated with higher fees has been amplified by post Covid\n          factors and the extended timescale for the implementation of the Lifelong Learning Entitlement.\n          In the “Looking Forward” section of the report we highlight some of the key strategic changes\n          that specifically address this situation.                               \n                                                                                  \n          Teaching and learning                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          As reported last year, we delivered teaching in the 2020/21 year entirely online (with the\n          exception of essential lab work), We had predicted that this would be the most appropriate way\n          to respond to the needs of our unique student body. We reviewed the outcome of this early in the\n          2021/22 academic year and confirmed that this had been a successful approach. All indicators\n          for 2020/21 showed improvements on previous years. Enrolment exceeded 2019/20, National\n          Student Survey satisfaction improved as did attainment and continuation (progress to the next\n          academic year). In addition, our awarding gap data showed some significant decreases.\n                                                                                  \n          Despite these strong indicators of success for 2020/21 many students and staff were keen to\n          return to in-person teaching (though about 30% of students indicated that they would prefer to\n          continue with online learning). After evaluation and discussion of the learning from 2020/21 we\n          revised our teaching model to re-integrate in-person teaching events, while maintaining the\n          pedagogic gains from our online year. The majority of subject areas continued to provide pre-\n          recorded material in place of face-to-face lectures, the content of which can be engaged with at\n          any time rather than only in one scheduled hour each week. We continued to enhance the\n          materials that we had developed for our Virtual Learning Environment, furthering our\n          commitment to a more blended approach to learning. Where and when online learning was used,\n          we continued with our distinctive interactive approach with live classes taking place weekly.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

In the context of our unique student body we felt it was\n          important to be able to make the switch online in a more agile way than campus universities\n          might need to. In reviewing the year it is clear that we had a similar balance to in-person and\n          online teaching as most other universities as the frequent outbreaks across the country resulted\n          in online being used as a back-up across the sector. In order to reduce infection and reassure our\n          vulnerable students we asked that masks continue to be used in our buildings and particularly in\n          our classrooms. We purchased Birkbeck branded masks and provided them free to students at\n          the beginning of term. Senior management and many other colleagues stood outside the building\n          at the start of the academic year offering masks to students. The response to this was incredibly\n          positive and created a strong norm of compliance.                       \n          Due to concerns about the omicron variant of Covid-19 we decided to begin Spring term 2022\n          entirely online and to phase back to in person teaching when appropriate. Our student surveys\n          again showed that this approach was regarded positively by the majority of students. We also\n          continued with online assessments in place of exams for the majority of subject areas. We\n          conducted further work to review the online assessment that was conducted in 2020/21 and\n          issued further guidance to academic staff about the structure and conduct of online\n          assessments.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n          Following the launch of our Vision 2021-26 strategy we embarked on a complete revision of our\n          portfolio for the future – a plan that had already been set out in the Student Experience Review\n          and was led by the PVC Education. The Director of Education Strategy and the Director of\n          Academic Standards and Quality worked directly with academic departments to review both their\n          UG and PGT portfolios. This work was supported by colleagues in Academic Quality and\n          Standards, Strategic Projects and the Assistant Deans for Education.    \n                                                                                  \n          The aims of the portfolio review were to create a streamlined competitive portfolio to improve\n          recruitment and enhance the quality of the student experience, to provide more work-based\n          learning and employability skills, greater interdisciplinarity and collaboration between academic\n          schools and top-quality digital resources. It also fully implemented 3-term learning across the\n          college and simplified the framework for learning, teaching and assessment. The new portfolio\n          has greater uniformity in programme structure leading to greater consistency of student\n          experience across departments, as well as a better foundation for standalone module delivery\n          supporting the lifelong learning entitlement, CPD and credit bearing short courses. It aims to\n          improve retention and attainment and reduce assessment burden, to meet the needs of time\n          poor students as well as those who want a more immersive campus experience, to create a\n          stronger cohort experience and to explore further ways of building student communities in person\n          and online. There will be greater clarity on attendance, contact hours and study hours.\n          Although the portfolio review was conducted rapidly, prompted by concerns about recruitment\n          and institutional financial position, the quality of the exercise was not compromised. The new\n          portfolio is now being advertised for enrolment in 2023.                \n                                                                                  \n          Student support                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          Our full range of student support services were offered in 2021/22 with the option for online\n          support continued across these services. We had amended our mitigating circumstances policy\n          for 2020/21 so that students did not need to submit evidence for a mitigating circumstances\n          claim if they had been prevented from submitting assessments due to unforeseeable events. In\n          the context of continued pressure on the NHS and the persistence of Covid-19 we continued with\n          this amendment to reduce pressure on students. We also continued to provide hardship funds to\n          enable students to purchase IT equipment to engage with our more blended approach to\n          learning.                                                               \n                                      Page 11",

The work in support of REF was led by the Pro- Vice-Chancellor\n          (Research) and involved major contributions of time and effort from some 113 colleagues across\n          the College. Research was submitted to 15 Units of Assessment two of which were joint\n          submissions with UCL.                                                   \n          The 2021 REF assessed the quality of research carried out at 157 UK universities in all\n          disciplines. Research was assessed by 34 panels of experts, each of which reviewed a different\n          area of research. For every member of staff with significant research responsibility, Birkbeck,\n          along with other universities across the UK, was required to provide evidence of:\n                                                                                  \n            •  their research outputs, such as books, papers and chapters published between 2014 and\n               2020;                                                              \n            •  impact case studies highlighting the benefits of the research they carried out over this\n               period; and                                                        \n            •  the environment in which research was carried out, including the strategy, resources and\n               infrastructure that support research.                              \n                                                                                  \n          The results showed that:                                                \n                                                                                  \n            •  41% of our research was rated at the highest 4* rating compared to 27% in the 2014\n               assessment;                                                        \n            •  83% of all research at Birkbeck is rated ‘world-leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’\n               (3*);                                                              \n            •  the quality and impact of Birkbeck research has improved overall since the last\n               assessment in 2014 when 73% of research was rated ‘world-leading’ (4*) or\n               ‘internationally excellent’ (3*);                                  \n            •  research was rated in the top 25 nationally in Art & Design (History of Art and Film, Media\n               & Cultural Studies), English Language & Literature, Biological Sciences, Computer\n               Science & Informatics, Earth Systems & Environmental Science, Economics &\n               Econometrics, History (Classics & Archaeology), Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience\n               and Sociology;                                                     \n            •  excellence was found across the college with more than half (53%) of the Units of\n               Assessment submitted ranking in the top half of all universities in the UK;\n            •  English Language & Literature (Department of English, Theatre & Creative Writing) was\n               ranked 2nd nationally, with 72% of the return assessed as being world-leading;\n            •  Art & Design (History of Art and Film, Media & Cultural Studies) was ranked 4th nationally\n               with 65% of the submission assessed as being world-leading;        \n            •  Birkbeck confirmed its status as consistently one of the best Psychological Science\n               departments in the UK with 64% of its research being rated as world-leading and a\n               national ranking of 9th, the third consecutive assessment where the Department has\n               ranked within the UK’s top 10; and                                 \n            •  History (Classics & Archaeology) was ranked 8th nationally with 63% of the return ranked\n               as world-leading.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

The results recognise the quality\n          and breadth of research and its impact on the world and they are testament to the hard work of\n          academic and research staff at Birkbeck, as well as all those professional services colleagues\n          involved in putting together Birkbeck’s submission to the REF.          \n          Despite being one of the smaller multi-faculty universities in the UK we are unusually also a\n          research-intensive university. We have a deep commitment to, and focus on, supporting\n          academics to pursue their research interests and carry out research of the highest quality. The\n          pandemic restricted movement within the UK and abroad and many of our portfolio of research\n          projects were placed on hold with funding bodies agreeing to no cost extensions. We recognised\n          that the disruption to research has impacted significantly on those at the start on their research\n          careers and on women. We increased the size of our internal Research Innovation Fund as a way\n          to support early career researchers. Academic colleagues have been able to access the fund for\n          a range of needs, including the costs of childcare and to assist with their research. We have also\n          taken steps to mitigate Covid impacts in our promotion processes.       \n                                                                                  \n          The development of the estate                                           \n                                                                                  \n          In July 2021 we completed the purchase of a long lease for Student Central (now Birkbeck\n          Central), Birkbeck Central is next door to our main Malet Street building so provided a\n          transformational opportunity to improve and increase our teaching, learning and student social\n          and communal space at the heart of our campus in Bloomsbury. It increased our campus space\n          by around 25%, enabled students to connect, engage and participate inside and outside\n          classrooms in ways in which we have not been able to facilitate in the past, allowing them to\n          maximise the benefit from their time with us. A three-year estate-wide project, commenced in\n          summer 2022 in Birkbeck Central to upgrade the quality of teaching space with the inclusion of\n          audio visual and IT equipment which will allow hyflex teaching for all of our students. Hyflex will\n          allow our time poor students (many of whom work during the day) to either attend classes in-\n          person or remotely and receive the same experience.                     \n          In addition to upgrading classrooms, we also need to focus on replacing critical infrastructure\n          which has reached the end of its useful life. A major project to replace heating in our main\n          campus buildings was concluded during the year and chillers are being replaced during the first\n          half of 2022/23. Design work to replace our core network switches, upgrade the IT infrastructure\n          and move a data centre has commenced with an expected finish date towards the end of\n          calendar year 2023. This project will improve the resilience, performance and efficiency of our\n          network capabilities and support the move to hyflex teaching.           \n                                                                                  \n          Prior to the start of the pandemic the College commenced a review of Professional Services office\n          space and took the decision to sell Egmont House, a freehold building. The layout of the building\n          was not conducive to collaborative working and required a material investment to replace end of\n          life infrastructure. The pandemic immediately moved all staff to remote working which\n          subsequently facilitated the development the Professional Services Workspace project, providing\n          modern agile facilities including open access desk space and bookable meeting rooms of various\n          sizes.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Phase 1 of the work provided space for staff previously in Egmont House, in rented space within\n          the BMA building in Tavistock Square. Phase 2 transformed space in the Malet Street building\n          formerly used for library offices. At the same time we created new and improved quiet study\n          space within the library.                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 13",

All central Professional Services staff were provided with laptops\n          allowing them to easily move from remote to on site working depending on the tasks required.\n          This change in working practice provided a better experience for staff and, having reduced the\n          total envelope occupied, running costs have also been reduced. The creation of the Professional\n          Services Workspace allowed us to dispose of Egmont House (completion Autumn 2021) and\n          reinvest the proceeds into the purchase of Student Central.             \n          Current operating position                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since\n          2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off\n          equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of\n          £5.0 million in 2018/19. Whilst the College returned to a £1.9 million underlying surplus in\n          2019/20, some £1.4 million was attributable to reduced expenditure through the initial months\n          of the pandemic.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (multi-faculty institutions\n          with turnover of £100 to £250 million and top quartile research ambitions) we are at the small\n          end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost pressures especially\n          relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and student body adds\n          major complexity and constraint to our underlying business model. Provision at the heart of a\n          capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue other activities in\n          the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity to limited hours in term time.\n          Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be addressed.\n                                                                                  \n          The impact of lower student income following the fall in recruitment in 2021/22 together with\n          higher staff costs have significantly impacted our financial position contributing to a deficit for\n          the year of £9.2 million. Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary\n          increases, increment advancement and pension costs) exceed the inflationary increase in our\n          main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate\n          tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but we now\n          need to reduce costs significantly to move from a period of forecast deficits back into a\n          sustainable financial position.                                         \n          The continued cap on Home undergraduate tuition fees is affecting the whole higher education\n          sector in England. The £9,250 fee is now worth around a third less than it was when it was\n          introduced in 2012 and with inflation running in excess of 10% the pressure placed on\n          universities to generate an excess of income over expenditure is considerable. The autumn\n          statement made no reference to HE funding and it appears likely that the capped Home\n          undergraduate fee will challenge the whole sector for years to come.    \n                                                                                  \n          It is also clear to us that the pandemic has had a profound effect on the way our students work\n          (with many now not expected to commute to the capital five days a week) and the careers that\n          they may wish to undertake in the future. Looking at lessons learned following our positive move\n          to on-line delivery during lockdown, coupled with a stronger alignment of our portfolio with\n          national and regional government strategy coupled with the skills needs of business, will shape\n          and underpin our future strategy.                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 14",

This will\n          take us to, and through, our 200th anniversary. The strategy is focussed on the difficult\n          challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as well as the lessons learnt and strides taken\n          forward in responding to it. It has built on Governors’ discussions, extensive internal consultation\n          involving staff and students, and a concerted analysis of Birkbeck’s position in the sector and the\n          London HE market.                                                       \n          The government’s proposals around introducing a Lifelong Learning Entitlement on the basis of\n          flexible modularised funding from 2025 are a game changing opportunity for our access and\n          lifelong learning mission, but we need to respond rapidly to benefit.   \n                                                                                  \n          The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental challenges for the College as it is\n          currently understood, in particular for financial sustainability, market position and teaching\n          competitiveness, and the ability to maintain research intensity. The strategy proposes to re-\n          establish clear ground for Birkbeck as the standout institution for highly flexible, high-quality\n          teaching which delivers lifelong learning and supports social mobility. The quality of our teaching\n          will be reinforced by targeted investment in our world-leading research areas and a renewed\n          ‘connected campus’ environment which will instil a sense of pride and belonging in staff and\n          students.                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          Delivering this repositioning will involve a fundamental revision of our underlying operational and\n          teaching delivery models, creating the greater degree of standardisation in mode of teaching\n          delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and support\n          student success. Addressing competitiveness will also involve the major efficiency gains that are\n          necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.               \n                                                                                  \n          With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23,\n          Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges which confirms the importance of this strategic\n          change but which makes its rapid realisation also essential.            \n          The College’s plans focus on the following interlocking themes:         \n                                                                                  \n                •  a new academic structure that maintains academic breadth, whilst creating larger\n                   more sustainable groupings for the future which are better aligned to opportunities\n                   for growth and which are supported by simplified, more focussed management\n                   structures and roles;                                          \n                                                                                  \n                •  optimising the support students get outside the classroom by reviewing and\n                   restructuring across the board arrangements for student facing administration\n                   services and support;                                          \n                                                                                  \n                •  the launch of a more competitive flexible Birkbeck teaching offer, in particular at\n                   undergraduate level, for autumn 2023 entry;                    \n                                                                                  \n                •  the rollout of new simplified teaching models for undergraduate and postgraduate\n                   provision that are both more effective and efficient;          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 15",

The intention is to lay the foundation for a\n          Birkbeck that can build and take advantage of its opportunities for the future not just survive in\n          its present. There are some key themes to that transformation. Birkbeck is a small institution,\n          and in the current climate there are particular challenges to that. Whilst we cannot compensate\n          for all the disadvantages of size we should be able to play to the advantages of smaller scale. At\n          the moment, the complexity, fragmentation and operational variation of our organisation does\n          not allow us to be as responsive, agile and innovative as we need to be. The simplification of\n          structure, management, lines of communication and operation are designed to give us back this\n          advantage for the future.                                               \n          In terms of the immediate financial challenges linked to student recruitment the College has\n          been working closely with Governors to confirm the immediate steps in its recovery plan. An\n          additional meeting of Governors was held in September 2022 to agree key actions:\n                                                                                  \n            •  a reduction in staff costs of £12m over two years to bring costs back into alignment with\n               reduced tuition income [a formal consultation on the organisational change and staff\n               reductions has taken place during Autumn 2022];                    \n                                                                                  \n            •  increased income totalling £15m by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new\n               modes of delivery (including hyflex), rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio\n               to make programmes more attractive, plus some additional third-stream income. Income\n               growth is required to initially return the College to a surplus position and to then offset\n               the mismatch between cost inflation and income inflation due to the fixed undergraduate\n               fee; and                                                           \n                                                                                  \n            •  reduce the size of our Estate. Having purchased the building adjacent to our main\n               campus site as part of our strategy to provide improved learning and teaching facilities\n               for our staff and students we are in a position to dispose of estate assets that are less\n               suited to our future needs. This will provide a cash inflow which in the short term can\n               protect liquidity before then being used to reinvest in the estate we need for our students\n               and to support the work of our staff.                              \n          2023 is set to be a challenging year but also potentially a foundational one. The interventions the\n          College needs to make now are driven by immediate challenge but are crucially the first steps to\n          providing a sustainable institution able to succeed in the future and continue to fulfil its mission.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 16",

This\n          report considers the pay of staff with other protected characteristics. \n                                                                                  \n          The gender pay data published in March 2022 for hourly pay and bonus pay is summarised in\n          Tables 1 and 2:                                                         \n                                                                                  \n           Publication      Mean hourly pay Median hourly pay Total employees     \n           date        Female (£) Male (£) Female (£) Male (£) Female Male        \n                                                                                  \n           March 2020     23.44    25.63   21.33    23.74   1,013    879          \n                         Gender pay gap 8.5% Gender pay gap 10.2% Total employees \n                                   lower             lower         1,892          \n                                                                                  \n           March 2021     23.37    25.54   21.15    22.91   1,035    875          \n                         Gender pay gap 8.5% Gender pay gap 7.7% Total employees  \n                                   lower             lower         1,910          \n                                                                                  \n           March 2022     24.02    25.61   21.15    21.72    969     833          \n                         Gender pay gap 6.2% Gender pay gap 2.6% Total employees  \n                                   lower             lower         1,802          \n          Table 1: Gender pay gap – hourly pay                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck first reported gender pay in 2003 when the mean gender pay gap was 16.9%.

We\n          operate a number of contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different\n          conditions required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to\n          demonstrate excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal\n          circumstances and all members of the committees tasked with reviewing applications undertake\n          both formal equality & diversity and unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is annually\n          reviewed by the College for equality & diversity issues in application and success rates.\n          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in\n          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal\n          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the\n          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted\n          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena\n          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the\n          academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 18",

As a result, in the most recent\n          three cycles female academics have enjoyed higher promotion rates than the norm.\n                                                                                  \n          Work continues on this issue but we are mindful of the time scales involved in managing\n          population change and the wider societal issues that influence career choice. This year, although\n          the vertical gender pay gap remains we can observe another small shift towards equality. In the\n          top quartile in 2020 46.8% of staff were female increasing to 48.9% in 2021.\n          The College Equal Pay Audit 2021 examines gender but also includes analyses of pay gaps by\n          ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation.

Facility time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the\n          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when\n          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open\n          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.\n                                                                                  \n          Relevant union officials:                                               \n                                                                                  \n           Number of employees who were relevant Full-time equivalent employee number\n           union officials during the relevant period                             \n                      2021           2022           2021            2022          \n                       37             33             30.7           26.2          \n                                                                                  \n          Percentage of time spent on facility time:                              \n                                                                                  \n           Percentage of time                     Number of employees             \n                                                    2020/21      2021/22          \n           0%                                            8             9          \n           1 - 50%                                      29            24          \n           51 - 99%                                      -             -          \n           100%                                          -             -          \n          Percentage of pay bill spent on facility time:                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                    2020/21      2021/22          \n                                                                                  \n           Total cost of facility time            £49,521.75    £44,078.09        \n           Total pay bill                      £67,775,000.00 £70,773,000.00      \n           Percentage of the total pay bill spent on facility 0.07% 0.06%         \n           time                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 19",

Now more than ever we have seen the\n          real and pressing need for flexible support. As we approach our 200th Anniversary in 2023, we\n          are proud that our community continues to come together to provide vital funding and expertise\n          to ensure that Birkbeck students and researchers continue to have access to the tools, support\n          and services that enable them to thrive.                                \n          As the new academic year begins I am pleased to reflect on the remarkable ways in which the\n          College community worked together to support each other to address and overcome the\n          unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that Covid presented.

In 1823 our philanthropist founder\n          Dr George Birkbeck set out his vision: ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings\n          of knowledge.’ This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have\n          made between work, study, culture, research and society. In order to protect our mission as we\n          move into our third century we will need to reposition our academic offering and reshape or\n          operating model. Our vison is still the same as our founder’s and we are determined to continue\n          to offer transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers,\n          financial, practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. To do this, however, it is\n          imperative that we implement our restructure plans and return to a financially sustainable\n          position. We will work closely with employers and government to assist with the up-skilling and re-\n          skilling of individuals which will be vital to the recovery of the regional and national economy.\n          Within an increasingly volatile operating environment, we will maintain and develop our\n          distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and\n          better space and facilities for all of our activities.                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Professor David S.

The principal activities undertaken by the Group (which includes the\n          College and a wholly owned subsidiary) are teaching and research together with ancillary\n          activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include rendering academic services to\n          a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations.           \n                                                                                  \n          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of\n          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in\n          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard\n          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,\n          has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are\n          prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed\n          assets and derivative financial instruments).                           \n          The Covid pandemic, the completion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union,\n          geopolitical events and increases in inflation have had a significant effect on families,\n          businesses, and economies across the world. Despite a swift and successful move to on-line\n          learning during lockdown student numbers have fallen post-Brexit at a time when costs are\n          rising, particularly energy costs. This has led to direct and indirect financial consequences for\n          Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.  \n                                                                                  \n          Although we need to rapidly address a financial position where costs exceed income we are not\n          alone in the UK HE sector. Government regulated tuition fees for Home undergraduate students\n          remain fixed at £9,250 at a time of rapidly rising costs. The erosion in value of the fee that can\n          be charged is placing considerable strain on the budgets of all universities in England. This\n          Financial Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial impact of\n          pension and other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive Income &\n          Expenditure and Statement of Financial Position.                        \n                                                                                  \n          Results for the Year                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Chart 4 compares the main income streams for the last five years whilst Chart 5 summarises the\n          total income for 2021/22.                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 23",

Teaching grant now represents only 2.4% of College income in comparison\n          with 47.5% in 2005/06. The primary change in funding was due to the removal of the London\n          weighting element from the grant for 2021/22 as government funding priorities were shifted to\n          support their levelling up agenda.                                      \n          In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to 58.0% in 2021/22,\n          albeit that this represented a year-on-year fall from 63.7% in 2020/21. Tuition income fell by\n          £8.4 million in 2021/22 wiping out the previous year gain of £8.3 million. 2020/21 saw a spike\n          in applications from EU students wishing to benefit from the final year of UK government tuition\n          fee loans. This increase was replaced by a significant reduction the following year as EU students\n          had to pay their own fees – an outcome seen across the sector not just at Birkbeck. In addition,\n          historically low unemployment rates coupled with increasing inflation appears to have reduced\n          the appetite of academic study for mature students.                     \n                                                                                  \n          Recurrent grant from Research England remained broadly the same (a fall of £0.2 million) whilst\n          externally funded research activity returned to pre-pandemic levels as restrictions on movement\n          (and, therefore, research activity) were relaxed post-Covid. £0.4 million of student hardship\n          funding provided by the Office for Students in 2020/21 was not continued and UK Research &\n          Innovation (UKRI) ended the Global Challenges Research Fund (representing the loss of £0.5\n          million in income). Overall, the total amount of grant and fee income fell by £9.6 million (9.0 %) in\n          2021/22 primarily due to the fall in tuition income.                    \n                                                                                  \n          As an evening provider of higher education Birkbeck rents much of its space to other universities\n          during the daytime and rents space from them in the evening to support the teaching of its own\n          students. With lockdown and ongoing safety restrictions limiting the activities which could take\n          place on campus, other income was depressed during 2020/21. We have seen a partial recovery\n          in 2021/22 with income from lettings, catering and conferences rising by £2.0 million. Further\n          growth back to pre-pandemic levels looks likely in 2022/23.             \n          In 2019, a review of the space occupied by central professional services staff was commenced.\n          The property occupied (Egmont House) needed infrastructure improvements and we had already\n          begun to consider the opportunity of moving to a hybrid working mode. The pandemic delayed\n          the review slightly but also accelerated the development of remote working. It was quickly\n          concluded that Egmont House was not well suited to collaborative and hybrid working and was\n          put up for sale. The freehold property was transferred to new owners in autumn 2021 with a\n          profit on sale of £14.1 million being achieved.                         \n                                                                                  \n          Space elsewhere on our estate plus rented accommodation nearby was converted into open plan\n          working space with multiple meeting rooms. All professional services staff were provided with\n          laptops to facilitate remote working or office working via desktops. The sale proceeds also helped\n          to fund the purchase of the 99-year lease for Student Central which is next door to our main\n          Malet Street building. The purchase of the building, which is at the heart of our campus in\n          Bloomsbury, was concluded in July 2021.                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Governors agreed a new investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support our core\n          business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our estates\n          strategy. £10.0 million was invested in two externally managed funds with strong Environmental,\n          Social and Governance criteria embedded in investment decision making. Both funds performed\n          remarkably well and combined gains of £3.3 million were recorded in 2020/21. In November\n          2021, gains of £4.0 million were realised and converted into cash with both funds reset to £10.0\n          million. Equity values began to fall in 2022 and the gain in investments for the year ended at\n          £0.3 million.                                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 25",

It is hoped that the Government progresses the promised lifelong loan allowance and\n          also relaxes the apprenticeship levy criteria thereby enabling businesses to support a wider\n          range of skills training through part-time and short courses. We continue to reinforce the need to\n          abolish the rule that prevents someone from studying a higher education qualification that is at\n          the same level or lower than those that they already have (ELQ). Re-skilling and up-skilling of the\n          UK workforce in key areas is a core part of both national and local government strategies.\n          Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this\n          occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown\n          restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters\n          programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to\n          upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-\n          Brexit) recovery. Unfortunately, this increase was reversed in 2021/22 in part due to high\n          employment rates in London and in part the end of the Brexit transition period.\n          Income from full-time Home students fell by £6.4 million as mature students in particular delayed\n          the commencement of education as employment levels rose. Income from international students\n          rose by £2.2 million (an increase of 10.0%). International student income has steadily grown over\n          the last five years as we have placed more emphasis on international brand management and\n          awareness. We believe that there is scope for further increases, particularly following the re-\n          introduction of the post-study work visa. Income from part-time students fell by £4.2 million\n          largely due to a fall in income from new Home undergraduates of £0.9 million and new Home\n          postgraduates of £1.2 million.                                          \n                                      Page 26",

The College does not own any student\n          residences (which increase income without a corresponding material increase in staff costs) so\n          this percentage remains one of the highest in the sector.               \n                                 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20  2020/21 2021/22         \n                                   £’000   £’000    £’000   £’000  £’000          \n                                                                                  \n           Gross salaries         70,226  73,313   73,942  75,403  74,819         \n           Movement on pension     (660)  20,481  (14,884)   (62)  20,270         \n           provision                                                              \n           Restructuring costs      401    3,308     299     534   2,325          \n                                                                                  \n           Total expenditure on salaries 69,967 97,102 59,357 75,875 97,414       \n                                                                                  \n           Gross salaries (excluding 64.4% 69.5%   68.0%    64.0%  69.1%          \n           movement on pension                                                    \n           provision and restructuring                                            \n           costs) as a percentage of total                                        \n           income                                                                 \n          Table 3: Change in underlying staff costs 2017/18 to 2021/22            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                    Staff costs and tuition income 2014/15  to                    \n                                     2021/22                                      \n                                                                                  \n                              85                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                              80                                                  \n            )                                                                     \n            m                                                                     \n            £                 75                                                  \n            (                                                                     \n            e                                                                     \n            r                                                                     \n            u                                                                     \n            t id              70                                                  \n            n                                                                     \n            e                                                                     \n            p                                                                     \n            x                 65                                                  \n            e                                                                     \n            /                                                                     \n            e                                                                     \n            m                                                                     \n            o                 60                                                  \n            c                                                                     \n            n                                                                     \n            I                                                                     \n                              55                                                  \n                              50                                                  \n                                 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022          \n                Tuition fees (actual/forecast) 62 66 68 66 67 71 80 71            \n                Staff costs       61   64   66  70   73   74   75   75            \n          Chart 9: Staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) and tuition income 2014/15 to 2021/22\n                                      Page 28",

With undergraduate fees fixed by the UK government and upwards\n          pressure on staff costs, particularly through pension contribution increases, there is a mismatch\n          between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff costs. The underlying\n          pressure is currently exacerbated by high inflation putting pressure on costs.\n          Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs\n          and the College delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit referendum fall in students enrolling\n          from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 8\n          and directly led to the underlying deficit in 2018/19. In 2019/20, lower staff costs following the\n          VSER scheme coupled with increased student income brought the two lines closer together. The\n          College saw a significant switch in 2020/21 due to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition\n          income and a surplus was delivered. Unfortunately, the reversal in new student enrolments in\n          2021/22 immediately reversed the trend – a trend which will continue into 2022/23.\n                                                                                  \n          Chart 9 graphically illustrates the financial challenge the College faces: with a heavy reliance on\n          tuition income, and an inability to increase the Home undergraduate fee, the College must\n          increase student numbers to offset cost inflation. With 69.1% of our costs currently invested in\n          our staff we are unable to quickly adapt our cost base to a shock to our primary income stream.\n                                                                                  \n          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2020 with the effect\n          that the scheme deficit increased. A repayment plan was agreed in 2021/22 and the College\n          recognised the increase in its share of the pension liability. This had the effect of reducing total\n          comprehensive income for the year by £20.3 million. Deficit contribution rates have increased to\n          6.2% of payroll from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2024 at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%.\n          USS estimated that the deficit would be eliminated by 30 April 2038.    \n                                                                                  \n          Table 4 summarises some of the key data on the scheme.                  \n                                                                                  \n           Contribution rates 2011 - Apr 16 - Apr 19 - Oct 19 - Oct 21 - Apr 22 - \n                           Mar 16  Mar 19  Sep 19  Sep 21 Mar 22  Mar 24          \n           Members          6.5%    8.0%    8.8%    9.6%    9.8%    9.8%          \n           Employers        16.0%  18.0%   19.5%   21.1%   21.4%   21.6%          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           Costs (£ million) 2017   2018    2019    2020   2021    2022           \n                                                                                  \n           Birkbeck share of 11.9   11.1    31.8    16.8    16.9    37.3          \n           the pension liability                                                  \n           at 31 July                                                             \n                                                                                  \n          Table 4: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)      \n                                                                                  \n          As can be seen from Table 4, the Universities Superannuation Scheme has become more costly\n          over time with the College contribution rate now 35% higher than it was in early 2016. Additional\n          covenant support was provided to USS by employers and benefits to members were reduced to\n          ensure that the 2020 valuation was concluded without unaffordable increases in contributions\n          being enforced. Changes to the global economy, particularly increasing inflation rates, have had a\n          marked effect on the indicative valuation of the pension scheme such that the liability has now\n          largely been eroded. USS are resisting calls from the University and College Union to reverse\n          benefit changes immediately given the volatility in economic data. A timetable has been\n          proposed to conclude the 2023 valuation by 1 April 2024.                \n                                      Page 29",

This year’s fall\n          in new students will adversely affect future years as lower numbers of continuing students\n          replace larger cohorts of graduating students. Staff costs inflate each year due to pay inflation,\n          incremental drift and promotions with National Insurance and pension contribution increases\n          also adding to the pressure. Not only do we need to reduce costs quickly to manage the fall in\n          student numbers but the challenge of managing rising costs with a fixed annual income is a cycle\n          we must break.                                                          \n          Although we posted an underlying deficit of £0.9 million in 2021/22 operating cash of £6.0\n          million was generated primarily due to the change in debtors and creditors: debtors decreased by\n          £0.9 million, creditors increased by £3.1 million and a provision was created for £1.0 million in\n          relation to restructuring. Cash flow forecasts assume that the provision and creditor increase will\n          unwind after the year end.                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Total cash plus investments increased by £14.7 million helped by the sale of Egmont House. This\n          cash inflow replaced some of the reserves used to purchase Student Central (now referred to as\n          Birkbeck Central) from the University of London for £35 million in July 2021. Net liquidity days\n          more than doubled to 111 days. It is worth noting, however, that in addition to the instant access\n          cash we also held £19.7 million of long-term investments – invested in two funds with Mercer\n          and Ruffer. Each of these funds generate investment income and are reasonably liquid (7 days).\n          £4.0 million of prior year gains in the two funds was converted into cash in November 2021.\n                                                                                  \n          Although the College share of the Universities Superannuation Scheme liability rose by £20.4\n          million (contributing to the £9.2 million fall in net assets) current economic assumptions indicate\n          that the liability has fallen considerably. It is hoped that the liability will be entirely removed\n          following the 2023 triennial valuation.                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Risk Management                                                         \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance.

The internal auditor also reviewed risk management\n          practices at the School and Department level as part a review of devolved controls and found\n          that action was needed to ensure completeness and recording of risk management locally.\n                                                                                  \n          The College Risk Management Policy explains the underlying approach to risk management and\n          documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit Committee, College\n          management groups and other key parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management\n          process and identifies the main reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis\n          together with an annual report on internal control and risk. The report for 2021/22 was\n          presented to the Audit Committee in May 2022. Audit Committee asked for the risk policy to be\n          revised to strengthen risk ownership and improve Birkbeck’s ability to identify significant risks\n          and respond to them quickly and effectively. As a result, we are developing a new approach to\n          risk in order to address these issues as well as the need to improve devolved risk management\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 31",

At the same time, inflation has increased our operating costs.\n                                                                                  \n            •  Costs exceed income                                                \n                                                                                  \n               Gross risk 25.00, residual risk 22.60 (2020/21: gross risk 20.25; residual risk 12.25).\n                                                                                  \n               In autumn 2021 we saw a 28% decrease in new student intake which did not recover in\n               2022 despite planning and delivering an intensive student recruitment campaign. Our\n               income is heavily dependent on tuition fees, so this has a serious impact on our financial\n               position.                                                          \n               While working to recover student numbers (see below) we are also taking action to\n               change our business model. Since the undergraduate tuition fee cap was frozen we have\n               had limited ability to increase income from fees except by increasing student numbers\n               and raising postgraduate and international fees where market conditions allow. This\n               mitigation is itself risky. Over the past five years we have experienced fluctuating financial\n               outturns driven by fluctuating student intakes and, with the exception of the 2020/21\n               pandemic year, have not achieved enough income to balance costs. Similarly, strategies\n               to manage costs have been limited to making savings within the existing organisational\n               structure, which reduces our resilience to inflationary pressure.  \n                                                                                  \n               In 2022 we agreed restructuring plans aimed at simplifying our organisation and reducing\n               the costs of operating it. We are a small university with limited income streams but our\n               structure resembles those of larger, financially stronger institutions. We are planning a\n               simpler structure with a reduction in staff costs of £12m over two years to bring costs\n               back into alignment with reduced tuition income.                   \n                                                                                  \n               We are also planning for increased income totalling £15m by 2026/27, primarily from\n               new programmes, new modes of delivery (including hyflex), rationalisation and\n               simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes more attractive, plus some\n               additional third-stream income. Income growth is required to initially return the College to\n               a surplus position and to then offset the mismatch between cost inflation and income\n               inflation due to the fixed undergraduate fee.                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 32",

We are also adjusting marketing and recruitment strategies to respond to growing\n               and new markets and further improve application and enrolment processes.\n                                                                                  \n          These two risks, and their mitigations, are critical as indicated by the very high scores. We have\n          modelled the impact of not achieving or partially achieving our plans. A downside stress test\n          indicates that we will remain solvent but liquidity could become an issue. Monthly cash flow\n          reports and management accounts are prepared and reviewed by management to help with early\n          identification of emerging risks.                                       \n          Other top risks are staff effectiveness, the education portfolio and cyber & data security. The first\n          will be addressed by restructuring, which involves a fundamental review of academic\n          organisation and management and the supporting professional services. The second will be\n          addressed by the academic portfolio review and re-launch. On cyber and data security, the risks\n          are linked to increased malicious activity. Audit Committee has overseen improvements in\n          compliance with data protection legislation and in managing IT security risk. This is likely to\n          remain a significant risk indefinitely due to the adaptability of those looking to breach security\n          arrangements.                                                           \n                                                                                  \n          Recognising that the organisation change we are embarking on is itself a risk, we have increased\n          the range and frequency of project and management groups. The Vice-Chancellor chairs\n          fortnightly meetings of the Academic Executive Team, which includes the DVC, PVCs, Executive\n          Deans of Schools and key Professional Service Directors. There are also frequent meetings of\n          Strategic Planning Committee which is the College’s wider executive group. Weekly meetings of\n          the change management project group led by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and supported by a\n          dedicated professional project management team ensure appropriate progress is being made.\n          The Governors have increased the frequency of their meetings to ensure effective oversight, and\n          the Chairs of the Governors’ committees are meeting regularly with senior management to\n          discuss progress.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 33",

The Governing Body has\n          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in\n          the following manner.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of education                                            \n                                                                                  \n          The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for\n          the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and\n          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills\n          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including\n          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and\n          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual\n          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins\n          everything we do.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in\n          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in\n          the Charities Act. The following table summarises our research income over the last three years:\n                                                                                  \n                                       2018/19  2019/20   2020/21 2021/22         \n                                                                                  \n           Research income (£’000)       8,839     8,412    8,287  9,333          \n           Income as a percentage of total income 8.4% 7.7% 7.0%    8.6%          \n          Table 6: Research income trends                                         \n          Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. The pandemic depressed the\n          amount of research activity that could be undertaken in the latter part of 2019/20 and most of\n          2020/21 leading to a fall in income recognised. Work has returned to normal in 2021/22 with a\n          corresponding increase in externally funded research income. The College currently has a\n          portfolio of live research projects related to in excess of £50 million in external grant funding.\n                                                                                  \n          The pandemic also had an impact on our research students with a number having to extend their\n          research phase prior to writing up. The College provided financial support to self-funding research\n          students in 2021/22 in the same way that research councils did.         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 34",

It also\n          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.\n          Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to\n          educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who\n          may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for\n          mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through\n          our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution\n          and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented\n          groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without\n          strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily\n          increasing to 863 FTE in 2021/22 (see Chart 6). During 2021/22 40% of the students are from\n          ethnic minority backgrounds (47% on our standard undergraduate programmes), 42% male, 22%\n          declaring a disability and 65% over the age of 25. We are proud to offer an opportunity to groups\n          of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and remain committed to driving this\n          agenda in the higher education sector.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students\n          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from\n          ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 97%\n          of our part-time students and 75% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity\n          for students who wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore,\n          offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be able to study.\n          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have\n          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that\n          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes\n          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time\n          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and\n          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to\n          continue with our current approach on access.                           \n                                                                                  \n          Many of our students work during the day and have families. These critical life factors inevitably\n          challenge our students and this is reflected in our continuation rates. Through the pandemic, the\n          move to on-line was welcomed as it enabled our students to study when time allowed. Since the\n          pandemic, hybrid working has become the norm for many workers who no longer need to travel\n          to the capital five days a week. To ensure that working students with other life priorities can\n          continue to engage with higher education and succeed we are moving all our programmes\n          towards hyflex delivery. This change in pedagogy will be facilitated by upgrades to the AV and IT\n          of all classrooms across our estate over the next three years.          \n                                                                                  \n          Detailed information on the ways that we provide support to our students can be found in the\n          College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to 2024/25.

Internal audit\n          monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure\n          that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the\n          Audit Committee.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n          Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:\n                                                                                  \n            •  the financial statements of the College give a true and fair picture of the state of its\n               affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cashflow for the financial\n               year;                                                              \n            •  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting\n               standards including the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction;   \n            •  external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those\n               purposes and managed appropriately; and                            \n            •  income has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions from both the\n               Office for Students and Research England.                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 41",

We\n          design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material\n          misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures\n          are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n                                                                                  \n          Based on our understanding of the Group and the sector in which it operates, we identified that\n          the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations are related to their registration\n          with the Office for Students (\"OfS”) and their ongoing conditions of registration, and we\n          considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the Group\n          Financial Statements or their continued operation. We also considered those laws and\n          regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as compliance with the\n          OfS Accounts Direction and tax legislation. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures\n          to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Board and other\n          management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence if any.\n                                                                                  \n          We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the\n          financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal\n          risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results and\n          management bias in accounting estimates.                                \n                                                                                  \n          The audit procedures to address the risks identified included:          \n                                                                                  \n            •  performing analytical procedures to identify unusual or unexpected relationships that\n               may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud.

Basis of preparation                                                \n                                                                                    \n                These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended\n                Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial\n                Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of\n                Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit\n                requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost\n                convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).\n                The College's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and\n                position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.\n                Going Concern                                                       \n                                                                                    \n                The impact of lower student income following Brexit and increased competition across London, together\n                with higher staff costs, have significantly impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs\n                (due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and pension costs) exceed the\n                inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on\n                undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded but we now need to\n                reduce costs significantly to move from a period of forecast deficits back into a sustainable financial\n                position.                                                           \n                In November 2021, the College endorsed a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26. The strategy is\n                focussed on the difficult challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as well as the lessons learnt and\n                strides taken forward in responding to it. The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental\n                challenges for the College as it is currently understood. In particular, financial sustainability, the ability to\n                maintain research intensity, market position and teaching competitiveness. Repositioning will involve a\n                fundamental revision of our underlying operational and teaching delivery models, creating the greater\n                degree of standardisation in mode of teaching delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in\n                our student offer and support student success. Addressing competitiveness will also involve the major\n                efficiency gains that are necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.\n                With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23, Birkbeck\n                now faces immediate challenges which confirms the importance of this strategic change but which makes\n                its rapid realisation also essential. In terms of the immediate financial challenges linked to student\n                recruitment the College has been working closely with Governors to confirm the immediate steps in its\n                recovery plan. The following key actions have been agreed:          \n              - a reduction in staff costs of £12m over two years to bring costs back into alignment with reduced tuition\n                income [a formal consultation on the organisational change and staff reductions has taken place during\n                Autumn 2022];                                                       \n              - increased income totalling £15m by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new modes of delivery\n                (including hyflex), rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes more\n                attractive, plus some additional third-stream income; and           \n              - reduce the size of our Estate.                                      \n                Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income and efficiency\n                savings, including stress testing. Although the mid-case scenario predicts underlying deficits for the next\n                two years the forecasts indicate that cash reserves will be maintained even under downside scenarios.\n                Governors have reviewed the financial forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and\n                medium term recovery strategy and the risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges\n                resulting from the drop in student numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the College has\n                adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Consequently, these annual\n                financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.         \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 51",

Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment\n                income receivable is shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as\n                expenditure and not deducted from income.                           \n                Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of\n                Comprehensive Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external\n                customers or the terms of the contract have been satisfied.         \n                Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and\n                Expenditure on a receivable basis.                                  \n                Grant funding                                                       \n                Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and RE research and research grants, are\n                recognised as income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the\n                grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as\n                deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after\n                more than one year as appropriate.                                  \n                Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the\n                College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income\n                received in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income\n                within creditors and released to income as the conditions are met.  \n                                                                                    \n                Donations and endowments                                            \n                Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and\n                endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income\n                when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is\n                utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.\n                Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.\n                Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income\n                during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to\n                the terms applied to the individual endowment fund.                 \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                         Page 52",

Other capital grants are recognised as income when the College has\n                satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.\n                                                                                    \n           4.   Accounting for retirement benefits                                  \n                College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme\n                (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are\n                primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by\n                professionally qualified independent actuaries.                     \n                Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities\n                of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined\n                contribution retirement benefit schemes.                            \n                A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the\n                schemes.                                                            \n                Defined contribution plan                                           \n                A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the College pays fixed\n                contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further\n                amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an\n                expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                Defined benefit plan                                                \n                Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n                defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n                employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n                returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n                the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n                plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n                employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to\n                determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed\n                by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n                recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either\n                through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n           5.

Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of\n                transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount\n                at the date of that revaluation.                                    \n                Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed\n                assets.                                                             \n                Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a building are\n                capitalised.                                                        \n                Land and buildings                                                  \n                Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after\n                initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future\n                benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful\n                life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.        \n                The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is\n                depreciated as follows:                                             \n                Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                          \n                Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                       \n                Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years                                 \n                Leasehold land: the life of the lease                               \n                Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation is charged until the asset is brought into use\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 54",

They are subsequently held at\n                carrying value. Heritage assets are not depreciated as their long economic life means that any\n                depreciation would not be material.                                 \n                The most recent professional valuation of heritage assets was carried out in June 2022.

Large value\n                software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial\n                phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8\n                years.                                                              \n                Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the\n                Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for\n                capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then\n                such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes\n                available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the\n                useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.\n           13.

It is, therefore, a\n                charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College\n                is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories\n                covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of\n                Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable\n                purposes.                                                           \n                The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is\n                included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their\n                cost.                                                               \n                The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial\n                organisation.                                                       \n                                                                                    \n           17.  Reserves                                                            \n                Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances\n                which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College\n                must hold in perpetuity.                                            \n                Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,\n                therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.     \n                                                                                    \n           18.  Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n                Management considers that certain accounting estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, debtors,\n                fixed assets and provisions are its critical accounting estimates.  \n                                                                                    \n                In preparing these financial statements the College has made the following judgements:\n              a) Pension provisions include key assumptions on discount rates, salary inflation and staff numbers in the\n                future. As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is\n                recognised as a liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan\n                agreed in the 2020 actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of\n                future salaries between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each\n                triennial valuation of the scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future\n                salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out\n                in note 26.                                                         \n              b) The Holiday pay provision is calculated using a sample of departments within the College.\n              c) A general provision for bad and doubtful debts is calculated using a formula based on the age of the\n                overdue debt. The formula is applied consistently each year but necessarily requires a degree of\n                estimation. A specific provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for individual debts where recovery is\n                believed to be uncertain and this requires an element of judgement. \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 56",

He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. As confirmed last year, the Vice\n              Chancellor’s salary will not be subject to any increase in relation to the national pay award. The Vice\n              Chancellor’s historic salary reflects his contribution to the leadership and development of the College over a\n              19 year period which has had transformational impact over this time. In view of Birkbeck’s current financial\n              position, the Vice Chancellor has requested that his salary is reduced by £50,000 per annum until further\n              notice. The Remuneration Committee have agreed to this reduction. The impact of this change will appear\n              in the 2022/23 Financial Statements.                                  \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 60",

Given that the senior pay review process has not now run\n              for three years, it considered specific remuneration issues linked to underlying changes in roles, job size\n              and responsibilities for several Professorial and Director level staff and made salary awards to three staff in\n              professional services management roles, two in academic management roles and a further one-off award\n              in relation to an academic management role. In reaching this decision the Committee was mindful of the\n              position of the College, the need to promote pay equality, and the broader guidance from the Office for\n              Students on pay restraint for senior staff.                           \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 61",

Our Awarding Gap Report outlines our approach to achieving the goals set out in the APP. We have\n              developed our approach to improving student retention and student success amongst a mature, part-time and\n              commuter-based student community, including in developing the curriculum, and investing in the Education\n              Directorate. The costs of these roles are not included in the APP expenditure categories, but are crucial to the\n              success in achieving our APP commitments. The expenditure commitments made in the APP are under the\n              following categories:                                                 \n              Access                                                                \n                                                                                    \n              Our expenditure on Access during the year was £371,000 compared with a forecast investment of £395,000.\n              This small underspend was due to two posts in the Access Team being vacant for part of this year.\n              Our Access work continues to focus on working with adults, as that is where we believe our expertise lies, and\n              where we can best contribute to OfS’s ambitions to improve access rates among underrepresented groups. Much\n              of our Access work is with Further Education Colleges, and with Local Authorities to improve adult attainment and\n              to support their children’s attainment. We responded to the OfS requirement in July for all institutions to provide a\n              variation to their APP, in which we set how our approach to Access work supports the OfS’s priority to raise pre-16\n              attainment.                                                           \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 63",

Additionally,\n              we raised £150,000 from philanthropic sources that were allocated as hardship and bursary support to students.\n              In Autumn 2021, we informed the OfS that we would use philanthropic funds to provide student financial support,\n              rather than directly funding the bursaries and we have reiterated this in our approach to the APP variation\n              submitted in July 2022. Our student numbers are also lower than in our forecast. Therefore while the financial\n              support recorded above is lower than forecast (£560,000 against a forecast of £681,000), with the addition of\n              the philanthropic funding of £150,000 the amount received by students is a total of £710,000.\n              Disability                                                            \n              We were not required to set a target for investment in disability in the APP, nevertheless, providing students with\n              the support they need is a key Birkbeck commitment. We invested £930,000 during the year, mainly through staff\n              costs, to ensure that everyone who could participate at Birkbeck was able to. The figure is an increase of last\n              year’s figure, reflecting an increased focus of effort and staff time on disability and wellbeing support, including a\n              Head of Student Wellbeing Services role and additional Mental Health Advisor provision. It is notable that\n              although undergraduate student numbers have declined in recent years, the proportion of students needing\n              disability and mental health support has risen. We have also increased expenditure on Disability services with\n              individual Study Support Plans, mental health and student counsellors, as well as disability advisors. The\n              recommendation of the Student Experience Review to offer more online study opportunities has resulted in a\n              more inclusive learning environment and one that better supports dyslexia and other neurodiverse conditions.\n              The move to online and remote assessments during the pandemic has continued and has reduced ‘exam hall\n              anxiety’ whilst supporting attainment for all students, with particular benefits to some disabled students.\n              Research and Evaluation                                               \n              The actual spend of £114,000 in Research and Evaluation is higher than our commitment in the APP of\n              £100,000. Several strands of work are ongoing to ensure that the awarding gap is minimised and eliminated, in\n              line with our APP targets. The research and evaluation of this work is a critical component for us to understand\n              what works so that the effective projects can be extended.            \n              The 2020/21 - 2024-25 Access and Participation Plan can be found here:\n              https://apis.officeforstudents.org.uk/accessplansdownloads/2024/BirbeckCollege_APP_2020-\n              21_V1_10007760.pdf                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 64",

The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,\n              providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme\n              are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are\n              not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore\n              exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of\n              the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by\n              Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a\n              wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents\n              the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery\n              Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution\n              recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate\n              to the deficit) with the related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.\n              FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a\n              collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a\n              scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as\n              Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has\n              entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the\n              recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they\n              relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.\n              College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-\n              employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions\n              under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n              The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2020 (the\n              valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method.\n                                                                                    \n              Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the\n              following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 76",

The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to\n              have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of\n              the assets of the scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £80.6\n              billion indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.\n              In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its\n              obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).\n                                                                                    \n              The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below.

The Trustee adopts\n              assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefirs\n              already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued\n              pension rights to be met.                                             \n              The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events\n              turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove\n              the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.\n              A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and\n              independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2020.\n              Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new\n              accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.       \n              The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2021 and will be reviewed again\n              at SAUL's next formal valuation in 2023.                              \n                                                                                    \n              At the 31 March 2020 valuation SAUL was 94% funded on its Technical Provisions basis. However, market\n              movements following the valuation date were positive and the Trustee and Employers agreed to allow for\n              post-valuation experience up to 30 April 2021. As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at\n              that date, no deficit contributions were required. However, the Trustee and the Employers agreed that the\n              ongoing Employers' contributions would increase from a rate of 16% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE\n              salaries from 1 April 2022 and to 21% of CARE Salaries from 1 January 2023.\n              Accounting Policy                                                     \n                                                                                    \n              Birkbeck College is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and\n              does not identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of\n              SAUL's assets at 31 March 2020 was £3,612 million representing 94% of the liabilities. The market value\n              of SAUL's assets at 30 April 2021 was £4,369 million representing 109% of the estimated liabilities.\n              It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.\n              Birkbeck College accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and\n              pension costs are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs\n              28.11 of FRS 102.                                                     \n              Although there was a Technical Provision deficit at 31 March 2020, allowing for post valuation experience\n              to 30 April 2021, SAUL has a Technical Provisions surplus. Therefore no deficit contributions were required\n              following the 2020 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit\n              contribtutions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the College.          \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                          Page 79",
