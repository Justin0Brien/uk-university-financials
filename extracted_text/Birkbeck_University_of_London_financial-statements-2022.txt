STRATEGIC REVIEW
Vice Chancellor’s Report
About Birkbeck
Birkbeck is a unique London-based teaching and research institution providing access to evening
higher education for non-traditional students of all ages. Most of our students are mature and
have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The age of our students ranges from 18
to 80 and our student body is diverse with 40% from BAME backgrounds and 58% women. As
well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing international student community now
welcoming students from 120 countries around the world.
Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that
proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was
successful in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) return with 83% of our research
being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). In terms of national
higher education quality assessments, we are one of the minority of institutions that rate highly
both for REF and for TEF, the teaching excellence framework.
Student Recruitment
Last year’s report highlighted a positive recruitment position during the Covid period. New
admissions totalled 4,819 FTE, the highest for a decade. Whilst for many the pandemic disrupted
careers, livelihoods, and businesses for others it also created time and opportunity to return to
study in 2020/21. There was also a significant EU effect with a rush to start programmes before
the right to loan funding was removed. The report pointed to significant challenges ahead and
this has been the case. New admissions in 2021/22 were 3,493 FTE compared to this high point
the previous year.
Applications in 2021/22 held at roughly the same level as 2020/21 where we had our highest
level of applications ever. The significant issue was the change in the makeup of those
applications. Increases in younger school and college leavers in UCAS and international
applications were key components of our strategy, particularly in relation to the impact of Brexit.
However, in parallel with that, from Easter to the end of the recruitment cycle in the autumn,
applications from 21–60-year-old London and UK based mature learners seeking to return to
formal education alongside work and other commitments dropped significantly. The College
received over 2,500 fewer applications from this group compared with the high point in 2020/21
when applications were just over 10,000.
This was not simply a Birkbeck impact, but a national one, with UCAS reporting major drops in
‘mature returners’ throughout the recruitment cycle. Some of the impact is related to the
situation in 2020/21 and the extent to which it brought forward and concentrated demand that
would otherwise have been spread over a number of years. The mature learner journey from
considering returning to study to starting that study can often take several years. A major factor
though is a post-pandemic one, reflecting new and emerging patterns of work in London and
across the UK, as well as the immediate and challenging circumstances that potentially stand in
the way of mature learners committing to study at this point.
At Birkbeck applications from over 21-year-olds convert into enrolments at a much higher rate
(35-50% depending on mode and level of study) than those from school/college leavers (10-
15%) and international students (5-10%) and this is the primary factor impacting the final
enrolment figure. Individual conversion rates for demographic group/mode and level of study
remained largely unchanged in this cycle but the shift in the overall admissions mix led to a much

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2022
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
lower level of enrolments from the same level of applications compared to the previous year. A
key strand of the college’s new strategy, outlined below, is to make changes to the Birkbeck offer
in terms of campus experience, teaching delivery, and student outcomes especially around
employability. In time these will allow us to capitalise on growing interest from younger commuter
students in London, international students, and increase conversion from these two groups.
There has been a significant Brexit impact on recruitment as we highlighted in reporting last year.
The focus of our recruitment has been EU nationals living and working in the UK, rather than
direct recruitment from EU countries. Direct recruitment from EU countries, with the implication
this brings of higher fees and no loan support, has dramatically declined. Recruitment from EU
nationals based in the UK has held up better but has been impacted by the general factors
affecting mature learners that have been highlighted already.
A very clear part of our strategy post-Brexit has been to focus on and significantly increase
international recruitment and it is encouraging to report significant progress here. International
recruitment is up significantly (39% on 2020/21 and 22% on 2019/20) and we now have more
students from India, China and Saudi Arabia in particular, leading to our highest ever
international student number levels. As well as growth at postgraduate Masters level where
international recruitment has been previously concentrated we had an increased cohort of
international undergraduates.
The recruitment picture for 2022/23 has remained challenging. Whilst new admissions have not
declined further and are set to be in the region of 3,500 FTE, the trends and factors highlighted
above have continued to play out. The long-term national factors driving down participation in
higher education by mature learners that have resulted from poor maintenance support and
older students’ aversion to the debt associated with higher fees has been amplified by post Covid
factors and the extended timescale for the implementation of the Lifelong Learning Entitlement.
In the “Looking Forward” section of the report we highlight some of the key strategic changes
that specifically address this situation.
Teaching and learning
As reported last year, we delivered teaching in the 2020/21 year entirely online (with the
exception of essential lab work), We had predicted that this would be the most appropriate way
to respond to the needs of our unique student body. We reviewed the outcome of this early in the
2021/22 academic year and confirmed that this had been a successful approach. All indicators
for 2020/21 showed improvements on previous years. Enrolment exceeded 2019/20, National
Student Survey satisfaction improved as did attainment and continuation (progress to the next
academic year). In addition, our awarding gap data showed some significant decreases.
Despite these strong indicators of success for 2020/21 many students and staff were keen to
return to in-person teaching (though about 30% of students indicated that they would prefer to
continue with online learning). After evaluation and discussion of the learning from 2020/21 we
revised our teaching model to re-integrate in-person teaching events, while maintaining the
pedagogic gains from our online year. The majority of subject areas continued to provide pre-
recorded material in place of face-to-face lectures, the content of which can be engaged with at
any time rather than only in one scheduled hour each week. We continued to enhance the
materials that we had developed for our Virtual Learning Environment, furthering our
commitment to a more blended approach to learning. Where and when online learning was used,
we continued with our distinctive interactive approach with live classes taking place weekly.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Our overall approach to the 2021/22 academic year was to provide in-person teaching where
possible and online learning if necessary. In the context of our unique student body we felt it was
important to be able to make the switch online in a more agile way than campus universities
might need to. In reviewing the year it is clear that we had a similar balance to in-person and
online teaching as most other universities as the frequent outbreaks across the country resulted
in online being used as a back-up across the sector. In order to reduce infection and reassure our
vulnerable students we asked that masks continue to be used in our buildings and particularly in
our classrooms. We purchased Birkbeck branded masks and provided them free to students at
the beginning of term. Senior management and many other colleagues stood outside the building
at the start of the academic year offering masks to students. The response to this was incredibly
positive and created a strong norm of compliance.
Due to concerns about the omicron variant of Covid-19 we decided to begin Spring term 2022
entirely online and to phase back to in person teaching when appropriate. Our student surveys
again showed that this approach was regarded positively by the majority of students. We also
continued with online assessments in place of exams for the majority of subject areas. We
conducted further work to review the online assessment that was conducted in 2020/21 and
issued further guidance to academic staff about the structure and conduct of online
assessments.
Following the launch of our Vision 2021-26 strategy we embarked on a complete revision of our
portfolio for the future – a plan that had already been set out in the Student Experience Review
and was led by the PVC Education. The Director of Education Strategy and the Director of
Academic Standards and Quality worked directly with academic departments to review both their
UG and PGT portfolios. This work was supported by colleagues in Academic Quality and
Standards, Strategic Projects and the Assistant Deans for Education.
The aims of the portfolio review were to create a streamlined competitive portfolio to improve
recruitment and enhance the quality of the student experience, to provide more work-based
learning and employability skills, greater interdisciplinarity and collaboration between academic
schools and top-quality digital resources. It also fully implemented 3-term learning across the
college and simplified the framework for learning, teaching and assessment. The new portfolio
has greater uniformity in programme structure leading to greater consistency of student
experience across departments, as well as a better foundation for standalone module delivery
supporting the lifelong learning entitlement, CPD and credit bearing short courses. It aims to
improve retention and attainment and reduce assessment burden, to meet the needs of time
poor students as well as those who want a more immersive campus experience, to create a
stronger cohort experience and to explore further ways of building student communities in person
and online. There will be greater clarity on attendance, contact hours and study hours.
Although the portfolio review was conducted rapidly, prompted by concerns about recruitment
and institutional financial position, the quality of the exercise was not compromised. The new
portfolio is now being advertised for enrolment in 2023.
Student support
Our full range of student support services were offered in 2021/22 with the option for online
support continued across these services. We had amended our mitigating circumstances policy
for 2020/21 so that students did not need to submit evidence for a mitigating circumstances
claim if they had been prevented from submitting assessments due to unforeseeable events. In
the context of continued pressure on the NHS and the persistence of Covid-19 we continued with
this amendment to reduce pressure on students. We also continued to provide hardship funds to
enable students to purchase IT equipment to engage with our more blended approach to
learning.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Research
The completion of the institutional submission for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) is
always a major strategic undertaking for any research-intensive institution such as Birkbeck – let
alone in the midst of a pandemic. The work in support of REF was led by the Pro- Vice-Chancellor
(Research) and involved major contributions of time and effort from some 113 colleagues across
the College. Research was submitted to 15 Units of Assessment two of which were joint
submissions with UCL.
The 2021 REF assessed the quality of research carried out at 157 UK universities in all
disciplines. Research was assessed by 34 panels of experts, each of which reviewed a different
area of research. For every member of staff with significant research responsibility, Birkbeck,
along with other universities across the UK, was required to provide evidence of:
• their research outputs, such as books, papers and chapters published between 2014 and
2020;
• impact case studies highlighting the benefits of the research they carried out over this
period; and
• the environment in which research was carried out, including the strategy, resources and
infrastructure that support research.
The results showed that:
• 41% of our research was rated at the highest 4* rating compared to 27% in the 2014
assessment;
• 83% of all research at Birkbeck is rated ‘world-leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’
(3*);
• the quality and impact of Birkbeck research has improved overall since the last
assessment in 2014 when 73% of research was rated ‘world-leading’ (4*) or
‘internationally excellent’ (3*);
• research was rated in the top 25 nationally in Art & Design (History of Art and Film, Media
& Cultural Studies), English Language & Literature, Biological Sciences, Computer
Science & Informatics, Earth Systems & Environmental Science, Economics &
Econometrics, History (Classics & Archaeology), Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience
and Sociology;
• excellence was found across the college with more than half (53%) of the Units of
Assessment submitted ranking in the top half of all universities in the UK;
• English Language & Literature (Department of English, Theatre & Creative Writing) was
ranked 2nd nationally, with 72% of the return assessed as being world-leading;
• Art & Design (History of Art and Film, Media & Cultural Studies) was ranked 4th nationally
with 65% of the submission assessed as being world-leading;
• Birkbeck confirmed its status as consistently one of the best Psychological Science
departments in the UK with 64% of its research being rated as world-leading and a
national ranking of 9th, the third consecutive assessment where the Department has
ranked within the UK’s top 10; and
• History (Classics & Archaeology) was ranked 8th nationally with 63% of the return ranked
as world-leading.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Birkbeck has a long history of supporting socially engaged research of the highest standard
across a broad range of disciplines and we are committed to embedding research in our
teaching, so that our students benefit from being taught about society’s most topical and
pressing issues by some of the country’s leading academics. The results recognise the quality
and breadth of research and its impact on the world and they are testament to the hard work of
academic and research staff at Birkbeck, as well as all those professional services colleagues
involved in putting together Birkbeck’s submission to the REF.
Despite being one of the smaller multi-faculty universities in the UK we are unusually also a
research-intensive university. We have a deep commitment to, and focus on, supporting
academics to pursue their research interests and carry out research of the highest quality. The
pandemic restricted movement within the UK and abroad and many of our portfolio of research
projects were placed on hold with funding bodies agreeing to no cost extensions. We recognised
that the disruption to research has impacted significantly on those at the start on their research
careers and on women. We increased the size of our internal Research Innovation Fund as a way
to support early career researchers. Academic colleagues have been able to access the fund for
a range of needs, including the costs of childcare and to assist with their research. We have also
taken steps to mitigate Covid impacts in our promotion processes.
The development of the estate
In July 2021 we completed the purchase of a long lease for Student Central (now Birkbeck
Central), Birkbeck Central is next door to our main Malet Street building so provided a
transformational opportunity to improve and increase our teaching, learning and student social
and communal space at the heart of our campus in Bloomsbury. It increased our campus space
by around 25%, enabled students to connect, engage and participate inside and outside
classrooms in ways in which we have not been able to facilitate in the past, allowing them to
maximise the benefit from their time with us. A three-year estate-wide project, commenced in
summer 2022 in Birkbeck Central to upgrade the quality of teaching space with the inclusion of
audio visual and IT equipment which will allow hyflex teaching for all of our students. Hyflex will
allow our time poor students (many of whom work during the day) to either attend classes in-
person or remotely and receive the same experience.
In addition to upgrading classrooms, we also need to focus on replacing critical infrastructure
which has reached the end of its useful life. A major project to replace heating in our main
campus buildings was concluded during the year and chillers are being replaced during the first
half of 2022/23. Design work to replace our core network switches, upgrade the IT infrastructure
and move a data centre has commenced with an expected finish date towards the end of
calendar year 2023. This project will improve the resilience, performance and efficiency of our
network capabilities and support the move to hyflex teaching.
Prior to the start of the pandemic the College commenced a review of Professional Services office
space and took the decision to sell Egmont House, a freehold building. The layout of the building
was not conducive to collaborative working and required a material investment to replace end of
life infrastructure. The pandemic immediately moved all staff to remote working which
subsequently facilitated the development the Professional Services Workspace project, providing
modern agile facilities including open access desk space and bookable meeting rooms of various
sizes.
Phase 1 of the work provided space for staff previously in Egmont House, in rented space within
the BMA building in Tavistock Square. Phase 2 transformed space in the Malet Street building
formerly used for library offices. At the same time we created new and improved quiet study
space within the library.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The spaces are now in use and have been well received across professional services and the
wider college community. All central Professional Services staff were provided with laptops
allowing them to easily move from remote to on site working depending on the tasks required.
This change in working practice provided a better experience for staff and, having reduced the
total envelope occupied, running costs have also been reduced. The creation of the Professional
Services Workspace allowed us to dispose of Egmont House (completion Autumn 2021) and
reinvest the proceeds into the purchase of Student Central.
Current operating position
Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since
2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off
equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of
£5.0 million in 2018/19. Whilst the College returned to a £1.9 million underlying surplus in
2019/20, some £1.4 million was attributable to reduced expenditure through the initial months
of the pandemic.
When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (multi-faculty institutions
with turnover of £100 to £250 million and top quartile research ambitions) we are at the small
end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost pressures especially
relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and student body adds
major complexity and constraint to our underlying business model. Provision at the heart of a
capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue other activities in
the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity to limited hours in term time.
Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be addressed.
The impact of lower student income following the fall in recruitment in 2021/22 together with
higher staff costs have significantly impacted our financial position contributing to a deficit for
the year of £9.2 million. Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary
increases, increment advancement and pension costs) exceed the inflationary increase in our
main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate
tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but we now
need to reduce costs significantly to move from a period of forecast deficits back into a
sustainable financial position.
The continued cap on Home undergraduate tuition fees is affecting the whole higher education
sector in England. The £9,250 fee is now worth around a third less than it was when it was
introduced in 2012 and with inflation running in excess of 10% the pressure placed on
universities to generate an excess of income over expenditure is considerable. The autumn
statement made no reference to HE funding and it appears likely that the capped Home
undergraduate fee will challenge the whole sector for years to come.
It is also clear to us that the pandemic has had a profound effect on the way our students work
(with many now not expected to commute to the capital five days a week) and the careers that
they may wish to undertake in the future. Looking at lessons learned following our positive move
to on-line delivery during lockdown, coupled with a stronger alignment of our portfolio with
national and regional government strategy coupled with the skills needs of business, will shape
and underpin our future strategy.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Looking Forward
In November 2021, the College endorsed a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26. This will
take us to, and through, our 200th anniversary. The strategy is focussed on the difficult
challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as well as the lessons learnt and strides taken
forward in responding to it. It has built on Governors’ discussions, extensive internal consultation
involving staff and students, and a concerted analysis of Birkbeck’s position in the sector and the
London HE market.
The government’s proposals around introducing a Lifelong Learning Entitlement on the basis of
flexible modularised funding from 2025 are a game changing opportunity for our access and
lifelong learning mission, but we need to respond rapidly to benefit.
The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental challenges for the College as it is
currently understood, in particular for financial sustainability, market position and teaching
competitiveness, and the ability to maintain research intensity. The strategy proposes to re-
establish clear ground for Birkbeck as the standout institution for highly flexible, high-quality
teaching which delivers lifelong learning and supports social mobility. The quality of our teaching
will be reinforced by targeted investment in our world-leading research areas and a renewed
‘connected campus’ environment which will instil a sense of pride and belonging in staff and
students.
Delivering this repositioning will involve a fundamental revision of our underlying operational and
teaching delivery models, creating the greater degree of standardisation in mode of teaching
delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and support
student success. Addressing competitiveness will also involve the major efficiency gains that are
necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.
With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23,
Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges which confirms the importance of this strategic
change but which makes its rapid realisation also essential.
The College’s plans focus on the following interlocking themes:
• a new academic structure that maintains academic breadth, whilst creating larger
more sustainable groupings for the future which are better aligned to opportunities
for growth and which are supported by simplified, more focussed management
structures and roles;
• optimising the support students get outside the classroom by reviewing and
restructuring across the board arrangements for student facing administration
services and support;
• the launch of a more competitive flexible Birkbeck teaching offer, in particular at
undergraduate level, for autumn 2023 entry;
• the rollout of new simplified teaching models for undergraduate and postgraduate
provision that are both more effective and efficient;
Page 15

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
• investment in a flexible blend of campus and digital experience, designed to give
our diverse student community the opportunities they deserve in a form that
recognises their changed circumstances and needs; and
• support for departmental workload models that allow the College to address issues
and mismatches of workload and resource equitably.
The proposed organisational changes necessarily provide a path to deliver significant savings but
that categorically is not its only purpose and scope. The intention is to lay the foundation for a
Birkbeck that can build and take advantage of its opportunities for the future not just survive in
its present. There are some key themes to that transformation. Birkbeck is a small institution,
and in the current climate there are particular challenges to that. Whilst we cannot compensate
for all the disadvantages of size we should be able to play to the advantages of smaller scale. At
the moment, the complexity, fragmentation and operational variation of our organisation does
not allow us to be as responsive, agile and innovative as we need to be. The simplification of
structure, management, lines of communication and operation are designed to give us back this
advantage for the future.
In terms of the immediate financial challenges linked to student recruitment the College has
been working closely with Governors to confirm the immediate steps in its recovery plan. An
additional meeting of Governors was held in September 2022 to agree key actions:
• a reduction in staff costs of £12m over two years to bring costs back into alignment with
reduced tuition income [a formal consultation on the organisational change and staff
reductions has taken place during Autumn 2022];
• increased income totalling £15m by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new
modes of delivery (including hyflex), rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio
to make programmes more attractive, plus some additional third-stream income. Income
growth is required to initially return the College to a surplus position and to then offset
the mismatch between cost inflation and income inflation due to the fixed undergraduate
fee; and
• reduce the size of our Estate. Having purchased the building adjacent to our main
campus site as part of our strategy to provide improved learning and teaching facilities
for our staff and students we are in a position to dispose of estate assets that are less
suited to our future needs. This will provide a cash inflow which in the short term can
protect liquidity before then being used to reinvest in the estate we need for our students
and to support the work of our staff.
2023 is set to be a challenging year but also potentially a foundational one. The interventions the
College needs to make now are driven by immediate challenge but are crucially the first steps to
providing a sustainable institution able to succeed in the future and continue to fulfil its mission.

Gender pay gap
Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to
operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which
rewards staff in line with the College commitment to equality and diversity. The Gender Pay Gap
report is produced each year as part of our ongoing commitment to monitor gender equality and
diversity pay issues in our workforce. We have been publishing equal pay audits since 2009 and
continue this practice in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific
Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on certain metrics
annually.
In addition to the mandatory annual Gender Pay Gap report, Birkbeck also undertakes a full pay
audit periodically (most recent April 2021) to provide analysis and recommendations in relation
to reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the institution. This
report considers the pay of staff with other protected characteristics.
The gender pay data published in March 2022 for hourly pay and bonus pay is summarised in

Table 2: Gender pay gap – bonus pay
Birkbeck makes a relatively low number of bonus payments in comparison to the wider sector –
for the latest published data the sector average is 7.6% of staff receiving a bonus payment. We
operate a number of contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different
conditions required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to
demonstrate excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal
circumstances and all members of the committees tasked with reviewing applications undertake
both formal equality & diversity and unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is annually
reviewed by the College for equality & diversity issues in application and success rates.
The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal
pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the
population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted
actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena
Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the
academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application

and promotion rate of women to more senior academic roles. As a result, in the most recent
three cycles female academics have enjoyed higher promotion rates than the norm.
Work continues on this issue but we are mindful of the time scales involved in managing
population change and the wider societal issues that influence career choice. This year, although
the vertical gender pay gap remains we can observe another small shift towards equality. In the
top quartile in 2020 46.8% of staff were female increasing to 48.9% in 2021.

Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2021
to 31 March 2022
The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility time is the
provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.

alumni and friends play an important role in advocating, supporting and volunteering for the
College.
Last year, over £5.4 million of new philanthropic income was committed to Birkbeck (2020/21:
£3.3 million). This included hundreds of donors making regular monthly gifts and multiple six-
figure donations from individuals, corporates and charitable foundations.
Chart 2: Breakdown of entities that supported Birkbeck with donations in 2021/22
These gifts will support a range of priority areas across the college such as:
• widening access to education and enhancing student support by strengthening financial
support offerings around bursaries, scholarships and hardship funding and enriching
pastoral care such as careers advice, wellbeing services and community outreach;
• academic research and PhD studentships through initiatives like the Research
Innovation Fund which provides seed funding for new research ideas, post-doctoral
awards for emerging academics and PhD scholarships for the next generation of
academic thinkers;

• capital projects, facilities and equipment by improving our provision of technology
enhanced learning, supporting state of the art equipment for our researchers and
contributing towards infrastructure projects that enrich the Birkbeck learning
experience; and
• funding for areas of greatest need where our donors understand the importance of
flexible funding to respond to the changing needs of our community and to enable us to
move quickly on innovative new projects.
Chart 3: Summary of activities to be supported by donations
In the last year we have seen huge momentum and support for The World Needs More Birkbeck
campaign. This comprehensive fundraising and engagement campaign is deepening our
relationships with current supporters and attracting new donors to support Birkbeck's ambitions
across four key areas: widening access to education; supporting our students; advancing world-
leading research; and ensuring state-of-the-art infrastructure and estates. In addition to
supporting the College financially, our alumni and friends continue to play an important role in
aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives. Last year we continued to see
more students benefiting from the support, guidance and advice given by our growing community
of valued volunteers.
The post-pandemic economy and rising living costs mean that many of our students, alumni and
donors are facing challenging and uncertain times ahead. Now more than ever we have seen the
real and pressing need for flexible support. As we approach our 200th Anniversary in 2023, we
are proud that our community continues to come together to provide vital funding and expertise
to ensure that Birkbeck students and researchers continue to have access to the tools, support
and services that enable them to thrive.
As the new academic year begins I am pleased to reflect on the remarkable ways in which the
College community worked together to support each other to address and overcome the
unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that Covid presented. We will need to continue to

work in this collegial manner to succeed in managing the challenges ahead as we look to bounce
back from the fall in student numbers.
In 2023 we will review the successes of our 200-year history. In 1823 our philanthropist founder
Dr George Birkbeck set out his vision: ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings
of knowledge.’ This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have
made between work, study, culture, research and society. In order to protect our mission as we
move into our third century we will need to reposition our academic offering and reshape or
operating model. Our vison is still the same as our founder’s and we are determined to continue
to offer transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers,
financial, practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. To do this, however, it is
imperative that we implement our restructure plans and return to a financially sustainable
position. We will work closely with employers and government to assist with the up-skilling and re-
skilling of individuals which will be vital to the recovery of the regional and national economy.
Within an increasingly volatile operating environment, we will maintain and develop our
distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and
better space and facilities for all of our activities.

Financial Review
The Financial Statements presented to the Governors comprise the consolidated results of the
College and its subsidiary. The principal activities undertaken by the Group (which includes the
College and a wholly owned subsidiary) are teaching and research together with ancillary
activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include rendering academic services to
a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of
Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,
has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are
prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed
assets and derivative financial instruments).
The Covid pandemic, the completion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union,
geopolitical events and increases in inflation have had a significant effect on families,
businesses, and economies across the world. Despite a swift and successful move to on-line
learning during lockdown student numbers have fallen post-Brexit at a time when costs are
rising, particularly energy costs. This has led to direct and indirect financial consequences for
Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.
Although we need to rapidly address a financial position where costs exceed income we are not
alone in the UK HE sector. Government regulated tuition fees for Home undergraduate students
remain fixed at £9,250 at a time of rapidly rising costs. The erosion in value of the fee that can
be charged is placing considerable strain on the budgets of all universities in England. This
Financial Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial impact of
pension and other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive Income &
Expenditure and Statement of Financial Position.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The recurrent teaching grant from the government continues to fall and fell by a further £1.6
million in 2021/22. Teaching grant now represents only 2.4% of College income in comparison
with 47.5% in 2005/06. The primary change in funding was due to the removal of the London
weighting element from the grant for 2021/22 as government funding priorities were shifted to
support their levelling up agenda.
In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to 58.0% in 2021/22,
albeit that this represented a year-on-year fall from 63.7% in 2020/21. Tuition income fell by
£8.4 million in 2021/22 wiping out the previous year gain of £8.3 million. 2020/21 saw a spike
in applications from EU students wishing to benefit from the final year of UK government tuition
fee loans. This increase was replaced by a significant reduction the following year as EU students
had to pay their own fees – an outcome seen across the sector not just at Birkbeck. In addition,
historically low unemployment rates coupled with increasing inflation appears to have reduced
the appetite of academic study for mature students.
Recurrent grant from Research England remained broadly the same (a fall of £0.2 million) whilst
externally funded research activity returned to pre-pandemic levels as restrictions on movement
(and, therefore, research activity) were relaxed post-Covid. £0.4 million of student hardship
funding provided by the Office for Students in 2020/21 was not continued and UK Research &
Innovation (UKRI) ended the Global Challenges Research Fund (representing the loss of £0.5
million in income). Overall, the total amount of grant and fee income fell by £9.6 million (9.0 %) in
2021/22 primarily due to the fall in tuition income.
As an evening provider of higher education Birkbeck rents much of its space to other universities
during the daytime and rents space from them in the evening to support the teaching of its own
students. With lockdown and ongoing safety restrictions limiting the activities which could take
place on campus, other income was depressed during 2020/21. We have seen a partial recovery
in 2021/22 with income from lettings, catering and conferences rising by £2.0 million. Further
growth back to pre-pandemic levels looks likely in 2022/23.
In 2019, a review of the space occupied by central professional services staff was commenced.
The property occupied (Egmont House) needed infrastructure improvements and we had already
begun to consider the opportunity of moving to a hybrid working mode. The pandemic delayed
the review slightly but also accelerated the development of remote working. It was quickly
concluded that Egmont House was not well suited to collaborative and hybrid working and was
put up for sale. The freehold property was transferred to new owners in autumn 2021 with a
profit on sale of £14.1 million being achieved.
Space elsewhere on our estate plus rented accommodation nearby was converted into open plan
working space with multiple meeting rooms. All professional services staff were provided with
laptops to facilitate remote working or office working via desktops. The sale proceeds also helped
to fund the purchase of the 99-year lease for Student Central which is next door to our main
Malet Street building. The purchase of the building, which is at the heart of our campus in
Bloomsbury, was concluded in July 2021.
Governors agreed a new investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support our core
business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our estates
strategy. £10.0 million was invested in two externally managed funds with strong Environmental,
Social and Governance criteria embedded in investment decision making. Both funds performed
remarkably well and combined gains of £3.3 million were recorded in 2020/21. In November
2021, gains of £4.0 million were realised and converted into cash with both funds reset to £10.0
million. Equity values began to fall in 2022 and the gain in investments for the year ended at
£0.3 million.

Chart 6: Undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) enrolment trends 2012/13 to 2021/22
*Undergraduate degree with a foundation year studied in a full-time mode
The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since the government increased Home
fees to £9,000 in 2012 appeared to have plateaued but further falls were experienced in
2021/22. It is hoped that the Government progresses the promised lifelong loan allowance and
also relaxes the apprenticeship levy criteria thereby enabling businesses to support a wider
range of skills training through part-time and short courses. We continue to reinforce the need to
abolish the rule that prevents someone from studying a higher education qualification that is at
the same level or lower than those that they already have (ELQ). Re-skilling and up-skilling of the
UK workforce in key areas is a core part of both national and local government strategies.
Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this
occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown
restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters
programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to
upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-
Brexit) recovery. Unfortunately, this increase was reversed in 2021/22 in part due to high
employment rates in London and in part the end of the Brexit transition period.
Income from full-time Home students fell by £6.4 million as mature students in particular delayed
the commencement of education as employment levels rose. Income from international students
rose by £2.2 million (an increase of 10.0%). International student income has steadily grown over
the last five years as we have placed more emphasis on international brand management and
awareness. We believe that there is scope for further increases, particularly following the re-
introduction of the post-study work visa. Income from part-time students fell by £4.2 million
largely due to a fall in income from new Home undergraduates of £0.9 million and new Home
postgraduates of £1.2 million.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
A significant proportion of our budget is focussed on academic and related services whilst
administrative and professional costs have been kept at the same level for the last five years.
Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and
restructuring costs) has been rising consistently over a number of years and has become
unsustainable. In general, restructuring costs should be included in this metric but are excluded
from Table 3 allowing for better year-on-year comparison. The College does not own any student
residences (which increase income without a corresponding material increase in staff costs) so
this percentage remains one of the highest in the sector.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2022
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Tuition fees and education contracts provided 66.8% of total income in 2021/22 (2020/21:
68.3%) whilst staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) represent 69.1% of total
income (2020/21: 64.0%). With undergraduate fees fixed by the UK government and upwards
pressure on staff costs, particularly through pension contribution increases, there is a mismatch
between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff costs. The underlying
pressure is currently exacerbated by high inflation putting pressure on costs.
Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs
and the College delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit referendum fall in students enrolling
from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 8
and directly led to the underlying deficit in 2018/19. In 2019/20, lower staff costs following the
VSER scheme coupled with increased student income brought the two lines closer together. The
College saw a significant switch in 2020/21 due to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition
income and a surplus was delivered. Unfortunately, the reversal in new student enrolments in
2021/22 immediately reversed the trend – a trend which will continue into 2022/23.
Chart 9 graphically illustrates the financial challenge the College faces: with a heavy reliance on
tuition income, and an inability to increase the Home undergraduate fee, the College must
increase student numbers to offset cost inflation. With 69.1% of our costs currently invested in
our staff we are unable to quickly adapt our cost base to a shock to our primary income stream.
The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2020 with the effect
that the scheme deficit increased. A repayment plan was agreed in 2021/22 and the College
recognised the increase in its share of the pension liability. This had the effect of reducing total
comprehensive income for the year by £20.3 million. Deficit contribution rates have increased to
6.2% of payroll from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2024 at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%.
USS estimated that the deficit would be eliminated by 30 April 2038.
Table 4 summarises some of the key data on the scheme.

Table 4: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
As can be seen from Table 4, the Universities Superannuation Scheme has become more costly
over time with the College contribution rate now 35% higher than it was in early 2016. Additional
covenant support was provided to USS by employers and benefits to members were reduced to
ensure that the 2020 valuation was concluded without unaffordable increases in contributions
being enforced. Changes to the global economy, particularly increasing inflation rates, have had a
marked effect on the indicative valuation of the pension scheme such that the liability has now
largely been eroded. USS are resisting calls from the University and College Union to reverse
benefit changes immediately given the volatility in economic data. A timetable has been
proposed to conclude the 2023 valuation by 1 April 2024.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Governors are concerned about the risk the scheme places on the financial health of the College
and the periodic uncertainty that the valuations introduce. It is hoped that changes in scheme
governance can be identified which provide more stability alongside alternate, lower cost options
for staff. Nationally around 20% of eligible staff choose not to be members of USS with many
citing affordability reasons.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Total income has been impacted over recent years by both Brexit and the Covid pandemic with a
fall in new student enrolments reversing the spike in tuition income in 2020/21. This year’s fall
in new students will adversely affect future years as lower numbers of continuing students
replace larger cohorts of graduating students. Staff costs inflate each year due to pay inflation,
incremental drift and promotions with National Insurance and pension contribution increases
also adding to the pressure. Not only do we need to reduce costs quickly to manage the fall in
student numbers but the challenge of managing rising costs with a fixed annual income is a cycle
we must break.
Although we posted an underlying deficit of £0.9 million in 2021/22 operating cash of £6.0
million was generated primarily due to the change in debtors and creditors: debtors decreased by
£0.9 million, creditors increased by £3.1 million and a provision was created for £1.0 million in
relation to restructuring. Cash flow forecasts assume that the provision and creditor increase will
unwind after the year end.
Total cash plus investments increased by £14.7 million helped by the sale of Egmont House. This
cash inflow replaced some of the reserves used to purchase Student Central (now referred to as
Birkbeck Central) from the University of London for £35 million in July 2021. Net liquidity days
more than doubled to 111 days. It is worth noting, however, that in addition to the instant access
cash we also held £19.7 million of long-term investments – invested in two funds with Mercer
and Ruffer. Each of these funds generate investment income and are reasonably liquid (7 days).
£4.0 million of prior year gains in the two funds was converted into cash in November 2021.
Although the College share of the Universities Superannuation Scheme liability rose by £20.4
million (contributing to the £9.2 million fall in net assets) current economic assumptions indicate
that the liability has fallen considerably. It is hoped that the liability will be entirely removed
following the 2023 triennial valuation.
Risk Management
An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
corporate governance. We provided a full compliance statement on internal control last year and
will continue to do so.
The internal auditor confirmed significant assurance with minor improvement opportunities on
the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Birkbeck’s framework of governance, risk
management and control in 2021/22. The internal auditor also reviewed risk management
practices at the School and Department level as part a review of devolved controls and found
that action was needed to ensure completeness and recording of risk management locally.
The College Risk Management Policy explains the underlying approach to risk management and
documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit Committee, College
management groups and other key parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management
process and identifies the main reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis
together with an annual report on internal control and risk. The report for 2021/22 was
presented to the Audit Committee in May 2022. Audit Committee asked for the risk policy to be
revised to strengthen risk ownership and improve Birkbeck’s ability to identify significant risks
and respond to them quickly and effectively. As a result, we are developing a new approach to
risk in order to address these issues as well as the need to improve devolved risk management

as identified by the internal auditor. This work will take in advice from the internal auditor and
feedback from the Audit Committee.
The top level Risk Register is compiled by senior management and overseen by a Risk
Management Group comprising the principal risk owners. Each risk owner is responsible for a
risk register for their risk area in which current and potential future risks are identified and
evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. Governance and oversight for
each risk area is provided by the relevant College committee or management group. The risks are
monitored by Audit Committee and Governors.
Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
(highest impact and likelihood) is 25.
The top risks are costs exceeding income and reduced student recruitment. These escalated
rapidly in 2021 and 2022, Market demand for part-time and evening courses has reduced after
the end of Coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, changes in working patterns and the onset of the
cost of living crisis. At the same time, inflation has increased our operating costs.
• Costs exceed income
Gross risk 25.00, residual risk 22.60 (2020/21: gross risk 20.25; residual risk 12.25).
In autumn 2021 we saw a 28% decrease in new student intake which did not recover in
2022 despite planning and delivering an intensive student recruitment campaign. Our
income is heavily dependent on tuition fees, so this has a serious impact on our financial
position.
While working to recover student numbers (see below) we are also taking action to
change our business model. Since the undergraduate tuition fee cap was frozen we have
had limited ability to increase income from fees except by increasing student numbers
and raising postgraduate and international fees where market conditions allow. This
mitigation is itself risky. Over the past five years we have experienced fluctuating financial
outturns driven by fluctuating student intakes and, with the exception of the 2020/21
pandemic year, have not achieved enough income to balance costs. Similarly, strategies
to manage costs have been limited to making savings within the existing organisational
structure, which reduces our resilience to inflationary pressure.
In 2022 we agreed restructuring plans aimed at simplifying our organisation and reducing
the costs of operating it. We are a small university with limited income streams but our
structure resembles those of larger, financially stronger institutions. We are planning a
simpler structure with a reduction in staff costs of £12m over two years to bring costs
back into alignment with reduced tuition income.
We are also planning for increased income totalling £15m by 2026/27, primarily from
new programmes, new modes of delivery (including hyflex), rationalisation and
simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes more attractive, plus some
additional third-stream income. Income growth is required to initially return the College to
a surplus position and to then offset the mismatch between cost inflation and income
inflation due to the fixed undergraduate fee.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
We plan to sell a surplus building, having purchased a new building adjacent to our main
campus building and following a reduction in new student numbers we now have too
much space. Disposing of an outlying building which is less suitable to modern hyflex
teaching will provide a cash inflow which in the short term can protect liquidity before
then being used to reinvest in assets.
• Student recruitment
Gross risk 25.00, residual risk 22.60 (2020/21: gross risk 22.50; residual risk 15.00).
The risk rating increased steeply last year after the unanticipated decrease in new
student intake. This year we have stabilised but not recovered the situation. There are
multiple factors for us to work through including: high rates of participation in HE at 18
mean there are fewer adults who have not been to university; cost of living issues make
potential students less likely to invest in study; full employment reduces the need for
lifelong learning; increased competition for all categories of student in London post-
Brexit; changing student aspirations etc.
To increase competitiveness and attractiveness we have conducted a wide-reaching
academic portfolio review and are launching a new course portfolio in 2023, with a
curriculum and delivery model that we believe is a better fit to what prospective students
want. We are also adjusting marketing and recruitment strategies to respond to growing
and new markets and further improve application and enrolment processes.
These two risks, and their mitigations, are critical as indicated by the very high scores. We have
modelled the impact of not achieving or partially achieving our plans. A downside stress test
indicates that we will remain solvent but liquidity could become an issue. Monthly cash flow
reports and management accounts are prepared and reviewed by management to help with early
identification of emerging risks.
Other top risks are staff effectiveness, the education portfolio and cyber & data security. The first
will be addressed by restructuring, which involves a fundamental review of academic
organisation and management and the supporting professional services. The second will be
addressed by the academic portfolio review and re-launch. On cyber and data security, the risks
are linked to increased malicious activity. Audit Committee has overseen improvements in
compliance with data protection legislation and in managing IT security risk. This is likely to
remain a significant risk indefinitely due to the adaptability of those looking to breach security
arrangements.
Recognising that the organisation change we are embarking on is itself a risk, we have increased
the range and frequency of project and management groups. The Vice-Chancellor chairs
fortnightly meetings of the Academic Executive Team, which includes the DVC, PVCs, Executive
Deans of Schools and key Professional Service Directors. There are also frequent meetings of
Strategic Planning Committee which is the College’s wider executive group. Weekly meetings of
the change management project group led by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and supported by a
dedicated professional project management team ensure appropriate progress is being made.
The Governors have increased the frequency of their meetings to ensure effective oversight, and
the Chairs of the Governors’ committees are meeting regularly with senior management to
discuss progress.

Public Benefit Statement
The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:
“The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Governing Body has
regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in
the following manner.
The advancement of education
The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.
The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins
everything we do.
In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
the Charities Act. The following table summarises our research income over the last three years:
2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22
Research income (£’000) 8,839 8,412 8,287 9,333
Income as a percentage of total income 8.4% 7.7% 7.0% 8.6%
Table 6: Research income trends
Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. The pandemic depressed the
amount of research activity that could be undertaken in the latter part of 2019/20 and most of
2020/21 leading to a fall in income recognised. Work has returned to normal in 2021/22 with a
corresponding increase in externally funded research income. The College currently has a
portfolio of live research projects related to in excess of £50 million in external grant funding.
The pandemic also had an impact on our research students with a number having to extend their
research phase prior to writing up. The College provided financial support to self-funding research
students in 2021/22 in the same way that research councils did.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Whilst our core mission underpins the advancement of education this in turn can have a
profound impact on wider public benefits.
The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
(prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.
Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to
educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who
may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for
mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through
our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution
and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented
groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without
strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily
increasing to 863 FTE in 2021/22 (see Chart 6). During 2021/22 40% of the students are from
ethnic minority backgrounds (47% on our standard undergraduate programmes), 42% male, 22%
declaring a disability and 65% over the age of 25. We are proud to offer an opportunity to groups
of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and remain committed to driving this
agenda in the higher education sector.
Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from
ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 97%
of our part-time students and 75% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity
for students who wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore,
offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be able to study.
In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that
government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes
for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time
sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and
demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to
continue with our current approach on access.
Many of our students work during the day and have families. These critical life factors inevitably
challenge our students and this is reflected in our continuation rates. Through the pandemic, the
move to on-line was welcomed as it enabled our students to study when time allowed. Since the
pandemic, hybrid working has become the norm for many workers who no longer need to travel
to the capital five days a week. To ensure that working students with other life priorities can
continue to engage with higher education and succeed we are moving all our programmes
towards hyflex delivery. This change in pedagogy will be facilitated by upgrades to the AV and IT
of all classrooms across our estate over the next three years.
Detailed information on the ways that we provide support to our students can be found in the
College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to 2024/25. Further details are provided in Note
9 to the Financial Statements.

Strategic Planning Committee
The Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor and consists of College
officers with strategic management responsibility. Its remit is to act as the College’s Executive
Committee responsible for its effective and successful operation. SPC considers College-wide
strategic issues and priorities and advises Governors accordingly. It is responsible for internal
planning and resource allocation, policy and procedures. It oversees the annual planning and
budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and Professional Services on developing plans
and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for presentation to Finance and General Purposes
Committee.
Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee
Under the College Statutes Governors have oversight and responsibility for all the College’s
activities, but must consider the advice of the Academic Board on all academic matters.
Academic Board is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the College and
reports termly on the business it has considered. The Academic Board is chaired by the Vice-
Chancellor and has a membership of more than 150 drawn from academic and Library staff and
the students of the College. To increase the effectiveness of its decision making, it has
established the Academic Board Executive Committee (ABExCo) as its steering committee.
ABExCo is also chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, whose members include the Deputy and Pro Vice-
Chancellors, the Executive Deans of the academic Schools and the academic staff and student
Governors, all of whom are also members of the full Academic Board.
The membership of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-7.
Statement of internal control
The Governing Body is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control that
supports the achievement of Birkbeck’s strategies, policies, aims and objectives whilst
safeguarding the public and external funds for which we are responsible, in accordance with the
responsibilities assigned to the governing body in the College Charter and Statutes and the public
interest governance principles set out in the regulatory framework for Higher Education in
England.
The system of internal control includes arrangements for the prevention and detection of
corruption, fraud, bribery and other irregularities. It is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to fulfil strategies, policies, aims and objectives and safeguard public funds,
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness.
The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify the principal
risks, evaluate the nature and extent of those risks and manage them efficiently, effectively and
economically. The process is regularly reviewed by Governors and accords with the principles in
the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.
Birkbeck manages risks through a Risk Register, which is reviewed by the Strategic Planning
Committee, and the Audit Committee reporting to Governors. The College’s Risk Management
Policy is reviewed annually by the Risk Management Group and Audit Committee reporting to
Governors.

STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)
• institution level collaborations are overseen by the College Collaborations Approval Panel
which reports to Knowledge Exchange Committee; and
• Governors review annually their Statement of Primary Responsibility which covers
responsibilities reserved to Governors and responsibilities delegated to committees or to
the Vice-Chancellor.
There have been no significant internal control weaknesses or failures during this reporting
period. This statement is based on the information provided to Governors in the regular reports
on internal audit and risk management.
Governors have appointed a professional independent Internal Audit Service whose annual
programme is approved by the Audit Committee. The internal audit function provides, by
undertaking review, independent objective assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit
Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the design and
effectiveness of the operation of internal controls that are intended to control critical business
application risks. Internal audit also helps the College accomplish its objectives by bringing a
systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk
management, control and governance processes and, by working with management, adding
value through advice and guidance.
The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the
Audit Committee.
Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:
• the financial statements of the College give a true and fair picture of the state of its
affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cashflow for the financial
year;
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting
standards including the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction;
• external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those
purposes and managed appropriately; and
• income has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions from both the
Office for Students and Research England.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2022
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion, the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the College’s affairs as at 31
July 2022 and of the Group’s and the College’s income and expenditure, gains and
losses, changes in reserves and of the Group’s cash flows for the year then ended; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice.
We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the College”) and
its subsidiary (“the Group”) for the year ended 31 July 2022 which comprise the Consolidated
and College Statement of Comprehensive Income & Expenditure, the Consolidated and College
Statement of Changes in Reserves, the Consolidated and College Statement of Financial
Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and notes to the financial statements,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the Group and College in accordance with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Board of Governors’ use of the
going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating
to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group
and College’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from
when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the
responsibilities of the Board of Governors’ members with respect to going concern are described
in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The Board of Governors is responsible for the other information. Other information comprises the
information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)
report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information including the Strategic Review, Statement of Corporate Governance and Internal
Controls, and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters required by the Office for Students (“OfS”) and Research England
In our opinion, in all material respects:
• funds from whatever source administered by the College for specific purposes have been
properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with relevant legislation;
• funds provided by the OfS, UK Research and Innovation (including Research England),
the Education and Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Education have been
applied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions; and
• the requirements of the OfS’s Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) have been met.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the OfS requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• the College’s grant and fee income, as disclosed in the note to the accounts, has been
materially misstated; and
• the College’s expenditure on access and participation activities for the financial year has
been materially misstated.
Responsibilities of Governors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Corporate Governance and Internal Control set out on
pages 36 - 41, the Board of Governors is responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the Board of Governors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing
the financial statements, The Board of Governors is responsible for assessing the Group and the
College’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Governors
either intends to liquidate the Group or the College or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures
are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
Based on our understanding of the Group and the sector in which it operates, we identified that
the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations are related to their registration
with the Office for Students ("OfS”) and their ongoing conditions of registration, and we
considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the Group
Financial Statements or their continued operation. We also considered those laws and
regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as compliance with the
OfS Accounts Direction and tax legislation. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures
to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Board and other
management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence if any.
We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the
financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal
risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results and
management bias in accounting estimates.
The audit procedures to address the risks identified included:
• performing analytical procedures to identify unusual or unexpected relationships that
may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud. Areas of identified risk are then
tested substantively;
• challenging assumptions made by management in their significant accounting estimates
in particular in relation to impairment, depreciation, defined benefit pension scheme
obligations and recoverability of trade receivables;
• discussions with management, including consideration of known or suspected instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud, including direct representation
from the Accountable Officer;
• identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted from staff
members with privilege access rights, journals posted by key management and journals
posted after the year end;
• reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit
reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC, OfS and relevant regulators to identify
any actual or potential frauds or any potential weaknesses in internal control which could
result in fraud susceptibility; and
• reviewing items included in the fraud register as well as the results of internal audit’s
investigation into these matters.
Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK, UNIVERSITY OF
LONDON (continued)
higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate
concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are
inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance
with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on
the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.
In addition, we also report to you whether income from funding bodies, grants and income for
specific purposes and from other restricted funds administered by the College have been
properly applied only for the purposes for which they were received and whether income has
been applied in accordance with the Statutes and, where appropriate, with the Terms and
Conditions of Funding with the OfS and Research England.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Section 75 of
the Higher Education Research Act 2017. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the College’s Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the College and the members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2022
Statement of Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 July 2022
1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
The College's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and
position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.
Going Concern
The impact of lower student income following Brexit and increased competition across London, together
with higher staff costs, have significantly impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs
(due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and pension costs) exceed the
inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on
undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded but we now need to
reduce costs significantly to move from a period of forecast deficits back into a sustainable financial
position.
In November 2021, the College endorsed a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26. The strategy is
focussed on the difficult challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as well as the lessons learnt and
strides taken forward in responding to it. The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental
challenges for the College as it is currently understood. In particular, financial sustainability, the ability to
maintain research intensity, market position and teaching competitiveness. Repositioning will involve a
fundamental revision of our underlying operational and teaching delivery models, creating the greater
degree of standardisation in mode of teaching delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in
our student offer and support student success. Addressing competitiveness will also involve the major
efficiency gains that are necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.
With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23, Birkbeck
now faces immediate challenges which confirms the importance of this strategic change but which makes
its rapid realisation also essential. In terms of the immediate financial challenges linked to student
recruitment the College has been working closely with Governors to confirm the immediate steps in its
recovery plan. The following key actions have been agreed:
- a reduction in staff costs of £12m over two years to bring costs back into alignment with reduced tuition
income [a formal consultation on the organisational change and staff reductions has taken place during
Autumn 2022];
- increased income totalling £15m by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new modes of delivery
(including hyflex), rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes more
attractive, plus some additional third-stream income; and
- reduce the size of our Estate.
Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income and efficiency
savings, including stress testing. Although the mid-case scenario predicts underlying deficits for the next
two years the forecasts indicate that cash reserves will be maintained even under downside scenarios.
Governors have reviewed the financial forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and
medium term recovery strategy and the risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges
resulting from the drop in student numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the College has
adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Consequently, these annual
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2022
Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
for the year ended 31 July 2022
2. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to
31 July 2022. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial year-end of the College's subsidiary, Cambridge House Limited, is 31 October.
Transactions to 31 July 2022 are included in the consolidation. The development held by the
subsidiary was transferred to the College in October 2021 and there was no further activity in the
subsidiary. Following the transfer the subsidiary was dormant and subsequently dissolved in
September 2022.
The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students'
Union as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
3. Income recognition
Tuition fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students
are studying. Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment
income receivable is shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as
expenditure and not deducted from income.
Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external
customers or the terms of the contract have been satisfied.
Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and
Expenditure on a receivable basis.
Grant funding
Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and RE research and research grants, are
recognised as income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the
grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as
deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after
more than one year as appropriate.
Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income
received in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income
within creditors and released to income as the conditions are met.
Donations and endowments
Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is
utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to
the terms applied to the individual endowment fund.

3. Income recognition (continued)
Donations and endowments (continued)
There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
a) restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective;
b) unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College; and
c) restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested to
generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
Capital grants
Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the College has
satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
4. Accounting for retirement benefits
College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
(USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
professionally qualified independent actuaries.
Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
contribution retirement benefit schemes.
A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
schemes.
Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the College pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Defined benefit plan
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to
determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
5. Employment benefits
Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are
accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused
entitlement.

6. Finance leases
Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.
7. Service concession arrangements
Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
financial liability.
Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
arrangement.
8. Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.
9. Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Total Comprehensive
Income and Expenditure for the year.
10. Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
assets.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a building are
capitalised.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.
The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
depreciated as follows:
Buildings: 40 to 100 years
Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years
Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years
Leasehold land: the life of the lease
Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation is charged until the asset is brought into use

Equipment
Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
equipment is capitalised.
Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
lives are as follows:
- Computer hardware: 3 years
- Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
- Other equipment: 3 to 5 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
Balance Sheet.
11. Heritage assets
Works of art and other valuable artefacts are capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. They are subsequently held at
carrying value. Heritage assets are not depreciated as their long economic life means that any
depreciation would not be material.
The most recent professional valuation of heritage assets was carried out in June 2022. The impairment
has been recognised in these financial accounts. See note 12 for further information.
12. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial
phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8
years.
Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for
capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then
such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes
available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the
useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.
13. Investments
Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
year.
14. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months
from placement and overdrafts.

Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
for the year ended 31 July 2022
15. Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:
a) the College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
b) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
16. Taxation
The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College
is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories
covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable
purposes.
The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
cost.
The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial
organisation.
17. Reserves
Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
must hold in perpetuity.
Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.
18. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Management considers that certain accounting estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, debtors,
fixed assets and provisions are its critical accounting estimates.
In preparing these financial statements the College has made the following judgements:
a) Pension provisions include key assumptions on discount rates, salary inflation and staff numbers in the
future. As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is
recognised as a liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan
agreed in the 2020 actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of
future salaries between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each
triennial valuation of the scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future
salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out
in note 26.
b) The Holiday pay provision is calculated using a sample of departments within the College.
c) A general provision for bad and doubtful debts is calculated using a formula based on the age of the
overdue debt. The formula is applied consistently each year but necessarily requires a degree of
estimation. A specific provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for individual debts where recovery is
believed to be uncertain and this requires an element of judgement.

Remuneration of the Vice Chancellor
The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been determined and reviewed through appropriate and robust
processes in terms of independence, objectivity, and assessment of individual and overall institutional
performance.
Remuneration Committee
The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been set and reviewed by a remuneration panel comprised of
independent Governors. The panel includes the Chair of Governors, but in accordance with good practice,
is chaired by another independent Governor. The Vice Chancellor is not a member of this panel and does
not attend or participate in its meetings or business. The panel is supported by the College Secretary &
Clerk to the Governors and, additionally, advice is provided, or commissioned, by the Director of Human
Resources.
Process
The panel reviews the remuneration of the Vice Chancellor annually in the light of the following
information:
 Sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other sources for a range of
relevant comparator institutions.
 Retention and continuity of senior leadership through a period of profound challenge and
transformation for the College has been a priority, thus additional institutions have been added to the
benchmarking profile to support objective consideration of retention issues.
 The outcome of the Vice Chancellor’s annual appraisal conducted by the Chair of Governors. This is a
formal documented process in which annual objectives are set and performance against those
objectives are reviewed.
 The broader context provided by institutional performance information and institutional KPIs agreed by
Governors.
Outcomes
The Vice Chancellor last received an increase in base salary, over and above the level of the national pay
award, in 2012. He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. As confirmed last year, the Vice
Chancellor’s salary will not be subject to any increase in relation to the national pay award. The Vice
Chancellor’s historic salary reflects his contribution to the leadership and development of the College over a
19 year period which has had transformational impact over this time. In view of Birkbeck’s current financial
position, the Vice Chancellor has requested that his salary is reduced by £50,000 per annum until further
notice. The Remuneration Committee have agreed to this reduction. The impact of this change will appear
in the 2022/23 Financial Statements.

Key management personnel compensation
The Remuneration Committee agreed that there would not be a pay review for senior College post holders
(the Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Pro Vice-Chancellors, College Secretary, Executive Deans, and
Professorial and Director level staff) in 2021/22. Given that the senior pay review process has not now run
for three years, it considered specific remuneration issues linked to underlying changes in roles, job size
and responsibilities for several Professorial and Director level staff and made salary awards to three staff in
professional services management roles, two in academic management roles and a further one-off award
in relation to an academic management role. In reaching this decision the Committee was mindful of the
position of the College, the need to promote pay equality, and the broader guidance from the Office for
Students on pay restraint for senior staff.

Severance Payments
During the year the Institution undertook further restructuring for 70 employees, £2,325,000. (2020/21:
19 employees, £534,000).
All compensation for loss of office in respect of higher paid staff is approved by the College's Remuneration
Committee. Amounts for compensation for loss of office and redundancy for all other staff are approved in
line with the scheme and in accordance with delegated authority.
Governors
The Governors are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the College's operations
and the composition of the Board, being drawn from local public and private sector organisations,
transactions may take place with organisations in which a governor may have an interest. Such
transactions have been declared under note 25 Related Parties.
No governors received any remuneration or waived payments from the group during the year (2020/21:
Nil). Governors who are employees of the College receive no additional remuneration for their services as
governors.
No governors received reimbursement of travel expenses incurred in attending meetings and events in
their official capacity during the year (2020/21: Nil).

Our Access and Participation Plan aims to reduce and eliminate gaps in achievement between different student
groups. Our Awarding Gap Report outlines our approach to achieving the goals set out in the APP. We have
developed our approach to improving student retention and student success amongst a mature, part-time and
commuter-based student community, including in developing the curriculum, and investing in the Education
Directorate. The costs of these roles are not included in the APP expenditure categories, but are crucial to the
success in achieving our APP commitments. The expenditure commitments made in the APP are under the
following categories:
Access
Our expenditure on Access during the year was £371,000 compared with a forecast investment of £395,000.
This small underspend was due to two posts in the Access Team being vacant for part of this year.
Our Access work continues to focus on working with adults, as that is where we believe our expertise lies, and
where we can best contribute to OfS’s ambitions to improve access rates among underrepresented groups. Much
of our Access work is with Further Education Colleges, and with Local Authorities to improve adult attainment and
to support their children’s attainment. We responded to the OfS requirement in July for all institutions to provide a
variation to their APP, in which we set how our approach to Access work supports the OfS’s priority to raise pre-16
attainment.

9a Access and Particpation (continued)
Financial Support
In 2021/22 we funded £560,000 of financial support to underrepresented undergraduate students. Additionally,
we raised £150,000 from philanthropic sources that were allocated as hardship and bursary support to students.
In Autumn 2021, we informed the OfS that we would use philanthropic funds to provide student financial support,
rather than directly funding the bursaries and we have reiterated this in our approach to the APP variation
submitted in July 2022. Our student numbers are also lower than in our forecast. Therefore while the financial
support recorded above is lower than forecast (£560,000 against a forecast of £681,000), with the addition of
the philanthropic funding of £150,000 the amount received by students is a total of £710,000.
Disability
We were not required to set a target for investment in disability in the APP, nevertheless, providing students with
the support they need is a key Birkbeck commitment. We invested £930,000 during the year, mainly through staff
costs, to ensure that everyone who could participate at Birkbeck was able to. The figure is an increase of last
year’s figure, reflecting an increased focus of effort and staff time on disability and wellbeing support, including a
Head of Student Wellbeing Services role and additional Mental Health Advisor provision. It is notable that
although undergraduate student numbers have declined in recent years, the proportion of students needing
disability and mental health support has risen. We have also increased expenditure on Disability services with
individual Study Support Plans, mental health and student counsellors, as well as disability advisors. The
recommendation of the Student Experience Review to offer more online study opportunities has resulted in a
more inclusive learning environment and one that better supports dyslexia and other neurodiverse conditions.
The move to online and remote assessments during the pandemic has continued and has reduced ‘exam hall
anxiety’ whilst supporting attainment for all students, with particular benefits to some disabled students.
Research and Evaluation
The actual spend of £114,000 in Research and Evaluation is higher than our commitment in the APP of
£100,000. Several strands of work are ongoing to ensure that the awarding gap is minimised and eliminated, in
line with our APP targets. The research and evaluation of this work is a critical component for us to understand
what works so that the effective projects can be extended.

Pension provision
The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the
contractual obligation with the USS to fund deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. In
calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the
duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation.
The USS 2020 valuation was signed with an effective date of 1 October 2021. The recommended deed on
benefit changes was executed by 28 February 2022.
Key assumptions and further information is provided in note 26. See also note 7 in respect of significant one-
off pension costs. More details on the 2020 actuarial valuation are set out in note 26.
Other provisions
During the year, the College undertook further restructuring. A provision has been recognised for amounts
agreed before the year-end which are due to be paid after the year-end.

25 Related party transactions
All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any significant
personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the composition of the Board
of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations) it is inevitable that transactions will
take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of staff may have an interest. All transactions
involving related parties are conducted in accordance with the College's financial regulations and procurement
The College has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 102 section 33 and has not disclosed transactions with
its wholly owned subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Limited.
During the year, the Group entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related parties.
Transactions entered into, and balances outstanding at 31 July 2022 are as follows:

The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students' Union as the
College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £340,000 (2020/21: £340,000)
was provided to the Union.
In 2018/19 a loan of £175,000 was issued to the Birkbeck Students' Union. The loan was issued to support their
return to a position of financial sustainability. The loan is repayable over seven years and no interest is charged. The
loan outstanding as at 31 July 2022 was £90,000.
At the year-end, there was a balance due to the Students' Union of £50,000 (2020/21: £74,000). As at 31 July 2022
there was no balance due from the Students' Union (2020/21: Nil).

26 Pension schemes
Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
• Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS); and
• The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL).
Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered
funds.
The total cost charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure was:
Year ended Year ended

SAUL 2,116 1,862
10,848 10,252
(i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)
The College participates in Universities Superannuation Scheme. The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,
providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme
are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are
not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore
exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of
the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by
Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a
wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery
Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution
recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate
to the deficit) with the related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a
collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a
scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as
Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has
entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the
recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they
relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.
College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-
employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions
under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2020 (the
valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method.
Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the
following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.

26 Pension schemes (continued)
(i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)
The 2020 valuation was the sixth valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime
introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to
have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of
the assets of the scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £80.6
billion indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.
In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its
obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).
The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the
Statement of Funding Principles (https://www.uss.co.uk/about-us/valuation-and-funding/statement-of-
funding-principles).
CPI assumption Term dependent rates in line with the difference
between the Fixed Interest and Index Linked yield
curve less:
1.1% p.a. to 2030, reducing lineraly by 0.1% p.a. to a
long-term difference of 0.1% p.a. from 2040
Pension increase (subject to a floor of 0%) CPI assumption plus 0.05%.
Discount rate (forward rates) Fixed interest gilt yield curve plus:
Pre-retirement: 2.75% p.a.
Post retirement: 1.00% p.a.
The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are
based on analysis of the scheme's experience carried out as part of the 2020 actuarial valuation. The
mortality assumptions used in these figures are as follows:
Mortality base table 2020 Valuation
101.0% of S2PMA "light" for males and 95.0% of
S3PFA for females.
Future improvements to mortality CMI_2019 with a smoothing parameter of 7.5, an
initial addition of 0.5% p.a. and a long term
improvement rate of 1.8% pa for males and 1.6% pa
for females.
The current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:
2022 2021

Males currently aged 65 (years) 23.9 24.7
Females currently aged 65 (years) 25.5 26.1

The funding position of the scheme has since been updated on an FRS 102 basis:
2022 2021
Total scheme assets £66.5bn £63.7bn
Total scheme liabilities £80.6bn £67.3bn
FRS 102 total scheme deficit £14.1bn £3.6bn
FRS 102 total funding level 83.0% 95.0%
The liability figures have been produced using the following assumptions.
2022 2021
Discount rate 3.31% 0.87%
Pensionable salary growth 4.20% 2.50%
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 and the SORP, the College has made a provision for this
contractual commitment to fund the past deficit.
A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2020 valuation which requires payment of 6.2% of
salaries over the period 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2024, at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%. The
2022 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan.
Employer and employee contribution rates for the scheme during the last three years were:
Employer Employee
From April 2022 21.6% 9.8%
October 2021 - March 2022 21.4% 9.8%
October 2019 - September 2021 21.1% 9.6%
April - September 2019 19.5% 8.8%
(ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)
General description of the Pension Scheme
Birkbeck College participates in the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London
("SAUL"), which is a centralised defined benefit scheme within the United Kingdon and was
contracted out of the Second State Pension (prior to April 2016).
SAUL is an independently-managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges
and institutions with links to higher education.
Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings
("CARE") basis.

(ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL) continued
Birkbeck College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current or participating employer's
obligations under the Rules of SAUL, but in the event of an insolvency of any participating employer within
SAUL, an amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that
employer, may be spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the next actuarial
valuation.
Funding Policy
SAUL's statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
the Trustee in payring SAUL's benefits as they fall due (the "Technical Provisions"). The Trustee adopts
assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefirs
already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued
pension rights to be met.
The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events
turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove
the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.
A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2020.
Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.
The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2021 and will be reviewed again
at SAUL's next formal valuation in 2023.
At the 31 March 2020 valuation SAUL was 94% funded on its Technical Provisions basis. However, market
movements following the valuation date were positive and the Trustee and Employers agreed to allow for
post-valuation experience up to 30 April 2021. As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at
that date, no deficit contributions were required. However, the Trustee and the Employers agreed that the
ongoing Employers' contributions would increase from a rate of 16% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE
salaries from 1 April 2022 and to 21% of CARE Salaries from 1 January 2023.
Accounting Policy
Birkbeck College is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and
does not identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of
SAUL's assets at 31 March 2020 was £3,612 million representing 94% of the liabilities. The market value
of SAUL's assets at 30 April 2021 was £4,369 million representing 109% of the estimated liabilities.
It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.
Birkbeck College accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and
pension costs are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs
28.11 of FRS 102.
Although there was a Technical Provision deficit at 31 March 2020, allowing for post valuation experience
to 30 April 2021, SAUL has a Technical Provisions surplus. Therefore no deficit contributions were required
following the 2020 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit
contribtutions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the College.
