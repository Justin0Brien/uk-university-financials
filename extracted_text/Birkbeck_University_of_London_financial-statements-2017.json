This has enabled the College to remain              \n          sustainable in the face of the decline of one of our core markets -     \n          part-time undergraduate degrees. Over the period 2012/13 to             \n          2016/17, part-time undergraduate degree enrolments have halved,         \n          as have enrolments to undergraduate certificates. In the past two       \n          cycles, there have been indications in some areas that the College      \n          may have reached a lower but more stable level, particularly in part-   \n          time undergraduate degrees. It is hoped that the introduction of        \n          maintenance loans for part-time students from 2018/19 may               \n          positively affect recruitment.                                          \n          We are also pleased to note that the Government and media commentators regularly mention\n          the importance of part-time students. However, because of the diversification of our offer and\n          strong growth in other markets, overall student FTEs have been broadly stable right across this\n          period of turbulence.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          2016/17 resulted in strong growth in full-time and part-time postgraduate taught students for\n          the College. Home and EU enrolments jumped by 11.8% (to 1,289 FTE) and 65.7% (to 653 FTE)\n          for part-time and full-time Masters programmes respectively. These increases are likely to be due\n          to the introduction of postgraduate loans for home and EU students. In this regard, it is\n          particularly satisfying that very large increases were observed in the 30-60 age group following\n          the success of the College’s political campaign which resulted in the raising of the age-limit of\n          these loans from 30 (which was originally proposed) to 60.              \n                                                                                  \n          At undergraduate level, full time enrolments by UK and EU students increased slightly from\n          2015/16 to 2016/17. This is particularly pleasing given the increase in competition in the sector\n          following the removal of the student number control for undergraduate students from the UK and\n          EU. The mature student market remains more volatile and harder to predict than 18-year old full-\n          time undergraduates which most universities depend on and we are concerned that economic\n          uncertainty and further competition may affect this particular part of our market.\n          International recruitment has been a relatively small but increasing sector for the College. Since\n          2013/14 income from international students, both full- time and part-time, has increased by\n          9.6% to £8.2 million and now represents 12.1% of our total tuition fee income (7.5% of total\n          income). The College became a Chevening partner in 2016/17 which increased our international\n          profile. The scheme, which is funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, contributed to\n          higher applications from international students for 2017/18 which in turn has led to higher\n          numbers of students once again. We will look to further develop our international reach during\n          2017/18.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 8",

The aim was to create a new type of business graduate\n               who can combine genuinely creative thinking and innovation with core financial and\n               strategic management skills. This new development is likely to be the first in a suite of\n               MBA programmes offering a different approach to the traditional MBA;\n                                                                                  \n            •  With the assistance of £50,000 funding from HEFCE, the Department of Computer\n               Science developed a conversion Master’s degree in Data Sciences. This course will\n               combine work in software engineering and data sciences to provide a Masters level\n               qualification for those with no previous computer or data science experience.\n          Portfolio development is undertaken by each of the five Schools on an annual basis to ensure\n          that our programmes meet the needs of students and employers in London and beyond.\n                                                                                  \n          The College has always been committed to improving access to higher education for students,\n          particularly for those who may not be able to directly enter an undergraduate programme. In\n          2017/18, for the first time, students will be able to enter four-year full-time evening degree\n          programmes which will begin with a Foundation Year and be followed by the standard three-year\n          full-time evening degree programme. These programmes will be for students who do not meet\n          standard requirements for the first year of a degree but who demonstrate the likely ability to\n          complete a degree subject with an additional year of study at the outset.\n                                                                                  \n          In addition to promoting access for all students in this way, we have also funded a programme\n          specifically for asylum seekers entitled “Bridges to Study”. Under this programme, 20 asylum\n          seekers (who because of their status cannot obtain loans and are subject to international fees),\n          will be given fully-funded undergraduate or postgraduate places at Birkbeck with a programme of\n          additional support to smooth their transition to UK higher education.   \n                                                                                  \n          In October 2016 we launched the initial phase of our outreach teaching initiative in Tottenham.\n          This is supported by the London Borough of Haringey (which contains no other University activity).\n          Eighteen students have begun study on the course, each of whom is receiving a £2,000 bursary\n          funded by Haringey for their study, so reducing the loan they need to take to £4,000 for this year.\n          As with all Birkbeck students, these students are eligible for further bursary support based on low\n          household income. Following completion of the introductory course, the students can progress to\n          further degree study at Birkbeck.                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

This consultation sets out the proposed new regulatory\n               approach and what this will mean for the sector and students. It includes proposals for\n               how higher education providers will enter the system, how they will be risk-assessed, the\n               conditions they will have to meet, how they will be monitored, and what potential actions\n               the OfS will be able to take;                                      \n                                                                                  \n            •  The cost of pensions, particularly in relation to USS, is becoming challenging to maintain.\n                                                                                  \n          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary.

In our third century we will continue to offer\n          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,\n          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. Within an increasingly volatile\n          operating environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and\n          contribution to science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all\n          of our activities.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n          Awards                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research\n          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution.

We work very hard at ensuring that the quality of both our research and teaching is at a\n          recognisably high standard whilst also enabling and encouraging students from diverse social\n          and educational backgrounds to participate in our courses.              \n                                                                                  \n          The 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF2014) determined that 73% of our research was\n          rated “world leading” or “internationally excellent” (compared with 56% in REF2008). 83% of our\n          academic staff were returned in the REF, a figure that is well above the sector average.\n                                                                                  \n          When the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) was announced we were concerned that the\n          metrics used may have unintentional consequences for us due to our unique mode of evening\n          teaching. In recognition of feedback received during the consultation for the review, institutions\n          were able to submit a detailed commentary alongside the pure data. We were delighted that the\n          review panel acknowledged our unique position and awarded the College a Silver grade.

They plotted the REF2014 grade point\n          average intensity score against a 25 point scale devised by them to convert the TEF metrics into\n          a “score”. Birkbeck appeared with 28 other institutions in the top right quadrant of the chart\n          which the article described as institutions which “can be considered to be successful at research\n          and teaching”. It is worth noting that only three of the institutions in this quadrant are based in\n          London – Birkbeck, Imperial and Brunel.                                 \n          Graduate earnings for our students also ranked well in the government’s Longitudinal\n          Educational Outcomes (LEO) salary data report. Our students were the 14th highest earners\n          among UK graduates and the sixth highest in London for the subjects we teach, outstripping the\n          salaries of graduates from universities including the London School of Economics and Queen\n          Mary, University of London.                                             \n                                                                                  \n          In the 2017 National Student Survey (NSS), Birkbeck was rated second among London\n          institutions for teaching. 90% of students taking part in the survey agreed that their courses were\n          intellectually stimulating - the sixth highest of any university in the country. We also scored higher\n          than the average in England over all four questions about teaching and were rated highly for\n          student satisfaction in many individual subjects with Philosophy named best in the country for\n          overall satisfaction.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          Although the TEF and REF confirmed that both our teaching and research are of high quality, and\n          the NSS indicated that our students found their courses intellectually stimulating, feedback from\n          students indicates that we could do better in student support and other aspects which contribute\n          to the student experience. Although our evening model of teaching gives working Londoners\n          access to higher education not available to them elsewhere, it also creates a unique challenge\n          when it comes to improving the provision of services to our students, many of whom come to\n          study straight from work. We are committed to this and are proposing to invest significantly in\n          new supportive activities following the completion of a review of the student experience by the\n          Pro Vice Master Education (report due for completion early 2018).       \n          We have also set aside funding to further develop our research support in 2017/18. In the lead\n          up to the next REF the Pro Vice Master Research has proposed new initiatives to support post\n          graduate research students, early career researchers and established academics. It is our\n          current aspiration to submit 100% of our research active staff to the next REF.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 13",

By the time we reach our 200th anniversary in 2023 it is our aim that all Birkbeck\n          students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or in buildings shared with other\n          HE institutions.

The structure aims to ensure that all aspects of each\n          project are appropriately managed thereby ensuring that value for money is obtained, the\n          building meets the needs of the client and budgets are not exceeded. Reports on major projects\n          are also provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee to provide assurance that all risks are\n          being appropriately managed.                                            \n                                                                                  \n          The first two projects - Toddlerlab (a new build to extend the research undertaken in the Babylab)\n          and Cambridge House (the redevelopment of an office block for teaching) - are currently working\n          towards planning submission. Both occupy independent sites in the control of the College and\n          construction is expected to commence in 2018.

Indicative timelines suggest that construction could begin on the Science block in 2019 and\n          the extension building in 2021.                                         \n          In addition to the new building projects our long term cash flow forecast includes prudent\n          estimates for: unspecified capital amendments to existing buildings; capital elements of our long\n          term maintenance plan; replacement of existing combined heat and power system; and capital\n          equipment. We do not expect to spend these funds in full but we are keen to ensure that the\n          main building projects are affordable even in a scenario where significant additional capital\n          funding was required.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 14",

Donations ranged from\n          regular monthly gifts, several legacies and six-figure gifts from individuals and corporates. These\n          donations supported a range of areas across the college including widening access provision,\n          student support, academic research and capital projects.                \n                                                                                  \n          In 2016/17 over 300 volunteers donated nearly 3,500 hours of their time to supporting students\n          across Birkbeck, aiding recruitment, retention and employability initiatives across the College.\n                                                                                  \n          Over the coming year we hope to further broaden our fundraising activity; deepening our\n          relationships with current supporters and attracting new donors to support the College’s\n          ambitious strategic priorities as we move towards the College’s 200th anniversary in 2023.\n                                                                                  \n          2016/17 was another very successful year for the College, both financially and academically. We\n          are continuing with the academic and student support developments that are essential to\n          creating the best possible environment for our students and we are embarking on a strategy for\n          investment in the College estate, something which is essential for the long term sustainability\n          and development of our teaching and research. On the back of a very strong performance in the\n          2014 Research Excellence Framework we achieved a Silver grade in the 2017 Teaching\n          Excellence Framework. These external reviews validate our strategic objective to deliver high\n          quality teaching and research.

Teaching grant fell by a further £1.6 million in 2016/17 (a\n          reduction of 17.5%). HEFCE teaching grant now represents only 6% of College income in\n          comparison with 47.5% in 2005/6.

Beneath this top level figure there has been a lot of change,\n          both in the types of students studying (undergraduate versus postgraduate) and by school. A\n          dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate has been compensated for by growth in full-time\n          undergraduate as can be clearly seen in Chart 3. In 2016/17, Masters recruitment showed a\n          marked increase due to the introduction of the post graduate loan. The School of Business\n          Economics & Informatics has grown by 25% over this period whilst the Schools of Arts, Social\n          Sciences History & Philosophy and Science have fewer students. Law has similar numbers to\n          2012/13 following a period of growth and then falling student numbers.  \n                                                                                  \n          Part-time student recruitment remains challenging for the sector and it is hoped that the\n          introduction of maintenance loan funding for part time undergraduate students in 2018/19 will\n          help to arrest the decline. Income from full-time Home and EU students increased by £3.3 million\n          (15%) primarily as a result of the continuing increase in full time undergraduate numbers and the\n          significant increase in Masters students (47% increase in full time Masters students). Income\n          from international students (which represents just over 6% of total income) increased marginally\n          over the previous year (£0.1 million) whilst part time student income fell by £1.8 million (5%)\n          despite an increase in part time Masters enrolments of 12%.             \n            )ETF(                                                                 \n            srebmun                                                               \n            tnedutS                                                               \n                      Enrolment  trends 2011/12  to 2016/17                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 18",

The College does not own any\n          student residences (which increase income without a corresponding increase in staff costs) so\n          this percentage is one of the highest in the sector. The College regularly reviews the level of staff\n          costs in relation to income and uses 60% as a benchmark during annual and long term planning.\n                                              2014/15   2015/16   2016/17         \n                                                £’000     £’000     £’000         \n                                                                                  \n          Gross salaries                       60,783    64,436    66,369         \n          Movement on pension provision         5,591     (464)     (181)         \n                                                                                  \n          Total expenditure on salaries        66,373    63,971    66,188         \n                                                                                  \n          Gross salaries (excluding movement on pension 57.1% 59.6% 61.1%         \n          provision) as a percentage of total income                              \n          Table 1: Change in underlying staff costs                               \n                                                                                  \n          Financial sustainability                                                \n                                                                                  \n          Table 2 brings together some key pieces of financial data for the Group from the last five years.\n          The data for years prior to 2014/15 have not been converted to the new SORP but are included\n          to indicate performance over time.                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                   2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17        \n          Total income (£’000)       96,262 101,463 106,388 108,087 108,595       \n          Total comprehensive income for the 6,736 6,622 5,921 14,029 7,483       \n          year (£’000)                                                            \n          Total comprehensive income as a 7.0% 6.5%   5.5%   13.0%   6.9%         \n          percentage of total income                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Non-current assets (£’000) 73,838 72,711  86,886  86,733 86,144         \n          Cash plus current investments 32,583 41,696 43,397 57,648 63,820        \n          (£’000)                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Net cash inflow from operating 3,813 10,448 11,130 10,842 6,957         \n          activities (£’000)                                                      \n          Operating cash as a percentage of 4.0% 10.3% 10.5% 10.0%   6.4%         \n          total income                                                            \n                                                                                  \n          Net liquidity days           139     169    161     219     238         \n          Staff costs as a percentage of total                                    \n          income (ignoring movement in 58.2% 58.7%   57.1%   59.6%  61.1%         \n          pension provision)                                                      \n          Net pension liability (£’000)  -       - (11,956) (11,835) (11,851)     \n          Total net assets (£’000)  103,753 109,254 72,754  86,783 94,539         \n          Table 2: Key financial data 2012/13 to 2016/17 (2014/15 onwards are calculated under FRS102 and the new\n          SORP)                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 20",

In 2016/17, total income remained static overall whilst staff costs increased due to\n          the annual inflationary rise and grade drift. The gain on investments of £1.3 million in 2015/16\n          was largely reversed by a loss of £0.9 million the following year, although there was no impact on\n          cash due to these adjustments.                                          \n          What is clear from Table 2 is that the College is generating reasonably consistent levels of cash\n          from operating activities. In 2016/17, the operating cash was affected by an unwinding of\n          increases in year-end debtors and creditors in 2015/16 – a net reduction in operating cash of\n          £2.2 million in 2016/17. Our strategy to return surpluses of 5% of income was primarily\n          introduced to ensure that we generated cash to invest in our future. The cash reserves that we\n          have built up will be invested back in to our estate with two projects entering the construction\n          phase in early 2018.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          The College is a member of two sector-wide pension schemes, both of which undertook a\n          triennial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the schemes in 2017. Following the 2014\n          valuation, both schemes reported a deficit and the College share of this deficit was included in\n          the balance sheet for the first time under the FRS102 regulations. The deficit in the Universities\n          Superannuation Scheme has increased at the latest valuation point and the formal review\n          process is currently under way. Whilst the College is committed to providing attractive reward\n          packages to all staff we are concerned that the deficit and an increase in the costs of providing\n          for future pensions will negatively impact on our financial sustainability. With staff costs already\n          representing over 60% of total income, further increases to our contributions will put significant\n          strain on other elements of our budget.                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Despite concerns over the pension schemes which the College has little direct influence over, we\n          are in a sound financial position with a strong cash base to invest in our future. That said, we are\n          mindful of the unprecedented uncertainty in the higher education sector at the moment.\n          Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n                                                                                  \n          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to\n          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit\n          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key\n          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main\n          reporting procedures.

The risks are grouped by themes,\n          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The\n          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual\n          report on internal control and risk for 2016/17 was presented to the Audit Committee in May\n          2017.                                                                   \n          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+).

By the time we reach our 200th anniversary in 2023 it is our\n               aim that all Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or\n               in buildings shared with other HE institutions. Governors have approved the College\n               Estate Strategy (total value around £150 million) which determined that four projects\n               were required. The first two building projects are planned to be on site in early 2018.\n                                                                                  \n               A number of risks have been noted in relation to the Estates Strategy including: projects\n               do not effectively meet the stated objectives; project budgets are not appropriately\n               managed; and long term cash levels negatively impact our financial sustainability. A\n               governance structure has been set up to oversee the projects including Project Boards\n               (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the external design\n               teams, senior College staff and lay Governors) which feed in to Estates Committee (a sub-\n               committee of Finance & General Purposes Committee). The structure aims to ensure that\n               all aspects of each project are appropriately managed. Reports on major projects are also\n               provided to each meeting of the Audit Committee and the management of major projects\n               is routinely reviewed by our internal auditor.                     \n               With an indicative budget of over £150 million the impact of the Estates Strategy on the\n               College has been assigned a net risk of 12.0 (amber).              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 22",

The\n               student body has changed over the last few years, with larger numbers of younger\n               students with different needs and expectations choosing to study with us. Many of our\n               students combine work with study and are consequently time poor. The College Pro Vice\n               Master Education is undertaking a wide ranging review of the student experience with a\n               view to recommending actions for improvement.                      \n                                                                                  \n               Although students find our programmes intellectually stimulating we are committed to\n               improving the student experience. The potential impact on student recruitment of failing\n               to provide services our students need is significant and the risk has been assigned a net\n               score of 12.0 (amber).                                             \n                                                                                  \n            •  Planning and prioritisation of investment                          \n                                                                                  \n               The higher education environment is more competitive than ever (new entrants to the\n               market, development of innovative modes of delivery, removal of student number\n               controls, changing expectations from students) and more uncertain (Brexit, government\n               policy, changing attitudes to higher education).

There is a differential risk between students\n          resident in the EU losing access to UK student loans and that of EU nationals recognised as\n          already living in the UK, whose status will be established during the negotiations. At Birkbeck,\n          around three quarters of undergraduate students classified by the SLC as EU tell us that they are\n          living in the UK when they apply to study. If all EU citizens living in the UK are granted ‘full UK\n          rights’ after Brexit, then these students should still be able to access loans. We have undertaken\n          a range of modelling using different assumptions but believe that the risk to income for the\n          College may be slightly lower than for other institutions due to the fact that most of our students\n          are already working in London when they apply to study. Fees Bursaries & Scholarships\n          Committee are overseeing the risk to students and reporting regularly to Governors. This risk will\n          be carefully monitored as government negotiations progress.             \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 23",

Whilst this noted in particular the negative\n          publicity in the press around Vice Chancellor salaries, Brexit uncertainties and increased\n          competition for students, sector uncertainty has increased still further following the\n          announcement by the Government that regulated fees would no longer rise in line with inflation\n          and that a significant review of HE funding was to be undertaken. Although we had been closely\n          monitoring student recruitment all year, conversion rates from application to enrolment appear to\n          have fallen despite applications being buoyant. The impact of this on income coupled with the\n          changes to student funding announced by the government recently will require us to review our\n          plans. The risk register will be updated and represented to Audit Committee for oversight as\n          appropriate.                                                            \n          On behalf of the Governing Body, I would like to thank all staff for their dedication and support in\n          ensuring the success of Birkbeck and its unique mission as a research-led teaching institution\n          with a strong commitment to flexible patterns of teaching.              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Sir Harvey McGrath                                                      \n          Chair of Governors                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 24",

The Governing Body has\n          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in\n          the following manner.                                                   \n          The College aims to provide higher education opportunities to people who would not otherwise\n          have access, continuing the mission since its inception. The College’s founder, George Birkbeck,\n          had a vision of the power of education to transform and improve lives, and this founding\n          commitment to social change and widening access is a core strand of what still drives the\n          College today. The College’s mission includes “enabling students from diverse social and\n          educational backgrounds to participate”. As London’s only specialist provider of evening higher\n          education, Birkbeck has long encouraged applications from students without traditional\n          qualifications or from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. \n                                                                                  \n          We actively encourage students with non-traditional qualifications to study at Birkbeck and offer\n          various flexible routes into study including Certificates of Higher Education and (from 2017/18)\n          undergraduate degrees with an additional Foundation year. Data from 2015/16 which was\n          included in our 2018/19 Access Agreement with the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) highlighted\n          that:                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n            •  35% of part-time entrants at Birkbeck had either level 2 (equivalent to GCSE), level 1 or\n               no entry qualifications in 2015/16.                                \n                                                                                  \n          Our outreach work, alongside the various entry routes to degree study, support students without\n          traditional entry qualifications to study successfully at Birkbeck. That a high proportion of part-\n          time students do not have a level 3 qualification is a strong demonstration of our commitment to\n          widening participation and to facilitating social mobility.             \n          Given our evening model of study, we attract a high proportion of mature students. 40% of our\n          undergraduate degree students chose to study part-time in 2016/17 and 94% of these students\n          are over 21 (as compared to 66% of full-time students). However, recruitment to our full-time\n          programmes has been more successful in recent years than to our part-time programmes: higher\n          fees and debt aversion have clearly been a deterrent to many mature, part-time students. The\n          introduction of maintenance loans for part-time students from 2018/19 may encourage some of\n          these students back to higher education. Unlike most higher education institutions, much of our\n          outreach work is with mature students with no previous experience of higher education,\n          especially those who have low incomes.                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 25",

Our 2018/19 Access Agreement\n          noted that:                                                             \n                                                                                  \n             • 32% of our part-time students were eligible for Birkbeck financial support in 2015/16\n               (criteria of household income below £40,000); and                  \n             • 40% of our full-time students were eligible for Birkbeck financial support in 2015/16\n               (criteria of household income of below £25,000).                   \n                                                                                  \n          We are pleased that full-time programmes delivered in the evening are proving attractive to\n          students from low income backgrounds and that we are able to offer attractive opportunities to\n          students who we would not have been able to reach with part-time provision.\n                                                                                  \n          The Access Agreement also highlighted that:                             \n                                                                                  \n             • 7.4% of our part-time students were eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) in\n               2015/16;                                                           \n                                                                                  \n             • 7.4% of our full-time students were eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) in\n               2015/16; and                                                       \n                                                                                  \n             • 16% of full-time and part-time students declared to us that they had a disability in\n               2016/17.                                                           \n                                                                                  \n          It should be noted that supporting part-time students is more resource intensive than supporting\n          full-time students, as they represent a Full Time Equivalent of less than one but require equal\n          levels of support. The figures show that there are significant numbers of students who do not\n          receive DSA but may well require additional assistance in order to study successfully. Both our\n          Disability and Dyslexia and Mental Health Advice Services work closely with these students to\n          ensure that they are given the best possible opportunity to succeed.    \n          The proportion of BME students on our full-time programmes remains high:\n                                                                                  \n             • 55% of full-time students were from BME groups in 2015/16; and     \n                                                                                  \n             • 39% of part-time students were from BME groups in 2015/16.         \n                                                                                  \n          Our widening access provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than\n          focusing on ethnicity but as our work is exclusively in London our approach invariably means that\n          we work with high numbers of students from BME groups.                  \n                                                                                  \n          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by\n          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In\n          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.\n          We also offer self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free\n          monthly instalments over the academic year.                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 26",

Our evening provision uniquely enables students to combine study in the\n          evening with meaningful work during the day. In order to support students to gain paid and\n          relevant job placements we have invested in our capacity to provide a particular type of careers\n          support and offer a service to create job brokerage called Birkbeck Talent.\n                                                                                  \n          As an example of a new initiative developed during 2016/17, Birkbeck has created the Compass\n          Project Outreach Programme and the Compass Project Fund. Set up with the support of\n          international law firm Allen & Overy and the Z Foundation, the Outreach Programme provides pre-\n          entry support to asylum seekers, with free workshops and events throughout the year. These\n          events and workshops are available to anyone who has sought sanctuary in the UK.\n          The Project Fund will offer 20 asylum seekers per year a fully-funded place on an undergraduate\n          or postgraduate certificate course at Birkbeck. Asylum seekers often arrive in the UK without\n          documentation, limiting their ability to find work or to enrol in courses of study. Unlike those\n          classified as refugees, their immigration status means that they are treated as international\n          students, with university fees set at the higher international rate and with no access to loan\n          support. This is often prohibitive for asylum seekers hoping to continue into higher education. As\n          well as offering funded places to asylum seekers we will also provide a tailored programme of\n          additional social and academic support to ensure a smooth transition into the British higher\n          education system. Additionally, each successful applicant will be assigned a personal tutor to\n          help them to navigate the academic processes at Birkbeck and provide pastoral care, as well as\n          a dedicated student buddy.                                              \n                                                                                  \n          20 students, including some from Syria, Iran and the Democratic Republic of Congo, commenced\n          programmes in September 2017. The students are studying courses in politics, data science,\n          economics, healthcare, international development, law, international security and global\n          governance, and legal methods.                                          \n                                                                                  \n          We will continue to invest significantly in activities which support student access, progression,\n          success and employability. A wide-ranging review of the student experience at Birkbeck is being\n          undertaken by the Pro Vice Master Education and it is expected that a number of\n          recommendations for improvement will be made when the report is finalised in early 2018.\n          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in\n          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in\n          the Charities Act.

Their findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports in April 2017. They\n          found that babies and toddlers who spent more time using a touchscreen slept less at night and,\n          despite sleeping more during the day, slept for less time overall and also took longer to fall\n          asleep. For every additional hour of touchscreen use during the day, children were sleeping for\n          nearly 16 minutes less in each 24 hour period. Sleep is important for cognitive development -\n          especially during the first few years of life, so the findings have important implications. Of the\n          families participating in the study, 75% of the toddlers (aged between 6 months and 3 years)\n          used a touchscreen on a daily basis, increasing from 51% at 6-11 months to 92% at 25-36\n          months.                                                                 \n          An earlier study from the research team showed that increased active touchscreen use (for\n          example scrolling, rather than passively watching videos) was associated with earlier\n          achievement in fine motor milestones in babies. Consequently, further research is needed to\n          understand in depth how to use modern technology in a way which maximizes benefits and\n          minimizes any negative consequences for young children.                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 28",

The\n          damage from this extreme weather affected landforms, habitats, societies and infrastructure,\n          and varied noticeably across the UK. Several high-magnitude storms over the course of the\n          winter were particularly devastating in the west and south-west of the UK while a single extreme\n          storm did most of the damage in the east.                               \n          The article highlighted how new technologies can be used to quantify some of the key coastal\n          impacts of such events. It also explored the need for new strategies for forecasting, early warning\n          and evacuation planning to mitigate possible future damage in the context of rising sea levels\n          and changing storm tracks.                                              \n          The promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown, or of the efficiency of the\n          police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services                  \n                                                                                  \n          The College has worked closely with the Institute for Criminal Policy Research (ICPR) for a number\n          of years and in 2016/17 it was agreed with the trustees of the charity to transfer the staff,\n          assets and liabilities of the charity to Birkbeck.

This summary describes\n          the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in the UK Corporate\n          Governance Code (2016) insofar as they relate to universities.

There is a\n          majority of lay members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the Governing Body are\n          separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.    \n                                                                                  \n          The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and\n          Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities and under the\n          Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability with the Higher Education Funding Council for\n          England.

Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to\n          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance\n          against material misstatement or loss.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including\n          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and\n          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of\n          reference.

The review concluded\n          that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in place\n          measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more\n          opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings. In 2016/17\n          four new lay governors were appointed following an open call for expressions of interest, which\n          increased the diversity of the Governing Body.                          \n          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of\n          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. It has\n          asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's processes and practices in line with the\n          provisions of the Code.

The Audit Committee met four times during the year.\n          The Audit Committee relies substantially on the work of the internal and external auditors, on the\n          information provided by management and the response of management to the questions it\n          raises.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The remit of the Audit Committee includes:                              \n            •  reviewing the effectiveness of the College’s systems of internal control and risk\n               management;                                                        \n            •  satisfying itself and assuring the Governors that satisfactory arrangements are in place to\n               promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness thereby securing value for money;\n            •  reviewing and approving the remit of the internal audit function;  \n            •  advising the Governors, as necessary, on the appointment and remuneration of the\n               internal and external auditors, and their quality, reliability and effectiveness;\n            •  reviewing with the external auditors the scope and nature of the audit, including the\n               report to Audit Committee written by the external auditors; and    \n            •  assessing compliance with the HE regulatory framework.             \n                                                                                  \n          The external and internal auditors have a standing arrangement to meet with the Audit\n          Committee regularly without senior officers present.

Internal audit also helps the\n          College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating\n          and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by\n          working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by\n          internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews\n          are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate\n          action confirmed to the Audit Committee.

Internal audit\n          monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure\n          that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports regularly thereon to the\n          Audit Committee.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 34",

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an\n             expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                                                                                  \n             Defined benefit plan                                                 \n                                                                                  \n             Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine\n             its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets.

Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n             recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either\n             through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       5.

Any unused benefits are\n             accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused\n             entitlement.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n       6.

Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets             \n                                                                                  \n             Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:          \n          a) The College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;\n                                                                                  \n          b) It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and\n          c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     \n                                                                                  \n             The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a\n             pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.          \n                                                                                  \n             A contingent liability arises from a past event that gives the College a possible obligation whose existence\n             will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly within the\n             control of the College. Contingent liabilities also arise in circumstances where a provision would otherwise\n             be made but either it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the\n             obligation cannot be measured reliably.                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n             A contingent asset arises where an event has taken place that gives the College a possible asset whose\n             existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly\n             within the control of the College.                                   \n                                                                                  \n             Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the notes.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       17.

It is, therefore, a\n             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College\n             is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories\n             covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation\n             of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively\n             charitable purposes.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is\n             included in the costs of such inputs.

Due to the nature of our business and the\n           composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations)\n           it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of\n           staff may have an interest. All transactions are conducted at arms length in accordance with the financial\n           regulations of the College. There were no material transactions during the year with related parties (2015/16:\n           nil).                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students'\n           Union as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £264,000\n           (2015/16: £264,000) was provided to the Union. There were no debtor or creditor balances outstanding at\n           the year end.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 64",

From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the\n           S2P. A defined contribution section was introduced in October 2016. The fund is independently\n           administered by trustees. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not hypothecated to\n           individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The College is, therefore, exposed to\n           actuarial risks associated with the employees of other institutions and is unable to identify its share of the\n           underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Consequently, and as\n           required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the College accounts for the scheme as if it were a\n           defined contribution scheme.                                           \n                                                                                  \n           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists\n           of a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer\n           scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide\n           scheme such as that provided by USS. The members of USS have entered into an agreement with the\n           scheme trustees which determines how they will fund the net pension deficit in the scheme. The accounting\n           principles pertaining to multi-employer schemes require the College to recognise the contributions payable\n           that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) as a liability in the Balance Sheet.\n                                                                                  \n           The resulting expense is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure. College\n           governors are satisfied that the scheme provided by USS meets the definition of a multi-employer scheme\n           and have, therefore, recognised as a liability the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under\n           the funding plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 65",

The\n           valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. Since the College cannot identify its share of the\n           scheme assets and liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for the scheme as a whole.\n           The 2014 valuation was prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act\n           2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to have sufficient and appropriate\n           assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme was\n           £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion. This results in a net\n           shortfall of £5.3 billion. The assets, therefore, were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had\n           accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The defined benefit liability for the scheme has been produced using the following assumptions:\n                                                                                  \n                                                2017          2016                \n                                                                                  \n           Discount rate                         2.6%         3.6%                \n           Pensionable salary growth              n/a          n/a                \n           Pension increases                     2.4%         2.2%                \n                                                                                  \n           Mortality in retirement is assumed to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S1NA\n           tables as follows:                                                     \n                                                                                  \n           Male members’ mortality: 98% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – no age rating\n                                                                                  \n           Female members’ mortality: 99% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – rated down 1 year\n                                                                                  \n           Use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience.
