                               A key strategic aim of the University is to        
                                                                                  
                               diversify income sources from multiple             
                               markets  - both in the UK and internationally,     
                               and from across all levels of study.               
                                                                                  
                               Our core strategies and activity plans are primarily focused on home
                               undergraduate students and international postgraduate students.
                               We have also grown our home recruitment across the main delivery markets
                               including Degree Apprenticeships, Continuing Professional Development (CPD)
                               and our online courses. Our ongoing ability to compete for high quality students
                               is a key foundation of our overall performance and providing a stable financial
                               foundation.                                        
                               The rich diversity of Aston University’s students and engagement is a core
                               part of our DNA. In this reporting year, a strong and growing proportion of our
                               undergraduate students and postgraduate students have come from outside the
                               UK. Notwithstanding this, the majority of our home undergraduate students come
                               from Birmingham and the wider Midlands region, demonstrating our commitment
                               to the local communities we serve, whilst growing our international student
                               population through diversification.

                               The centre is committed to helping hundreds of international students every year
                               to gain access to a university degree, by developing their academic research and
                               writing skills, introducing them to the foundations of their subjects and improving
                               their English language proficiency.

                               This partnership represents our long-term commitment to diversifying our
                               international student base. We also have strong partnerships with other providers,

     Creating the Aston for Life platform                                         
     Aston University graduates have been involved                                
     throughout the entire process in creating the platform.                      
     More than 500 volunteers provided content, took part                         
     in focus groups and surveys, acted as beta testers                           
     and became network leaders. Many more will shape                             
     and grow the platform post-launch as we continue to                          
     co-create with our alumni community to ensure value                          
     is added to their lives every step of the way.

     Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)                                     
     FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-              
     employer scheme. A group plan consists of a collection of entities           
     under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A                 
     multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common              
     control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such              
     as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a                  
     multi-employer scheme where the employer has entered into an                 
     agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer                   
     will fund a deficit results in the recognition of a liability for the        
     contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent           
     that they relate to the deficit) with the resulting expense charged          
     through the profit or loss account in accordance with section 28             
     of FRS 102. The Council Members are satisfied that Universities              
     Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-employer               
     scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of             
     the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in existence

   The median employee salary figure used to calculate the above ratio is based on the annual full time salary of all included on the
   University’s payrolls. This includes all individuals that the University includes in its HESA staff record, including any individual service
   companies who are deemed employees under IR35.                                 
   This excludes agency staff, individuals with honorary contracts where the contract is not deemed to be a contract of employment
   and self-employed individuals outside the scope of IR35. Agency staff are excluded as it is not possible with the current systems and
   processes in place to identify the equivalent annual salary at an individual level. Agency staff are used for a range of activities across the
   University, however, they are often not full-time, are charged for via third parties often on a consolidated basis and the rate charged
   includes a fee to the third party and VAT. Therefore, it is not possible to identify an accurate median salary for these individuals.

   Former Vice-Chancellor                                                         
                                                                                  
   The Former Interim Vice-Chancellor was an internal appointment that included the adjustment of a range of Executive-level responsibilities,
   including some Executive roles taking on interim responsibility for aspects of operational leadership that would normally be undertaken by
   the Vice-Chancellor.                                                           
   In determining the pay for the Interim Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Committee used benchmarking data on Vice-Chancellor
   remuneration to determine a fair and equitable total pay position based on the nature, content and duration of the interim appointment.
   The performance of the Interim Vice-Chancellor was monitored throughout her interim appointment including through ongoing 1:1
   performance review with the Chair of Council.

Notes to the Accounts  (Continued)                                           
     For the year ended 31 July 2023                                              
                                                                                  
     Vice-Chancellor                                                              
                                                                                  
     The Vice Chancellor was appointed on 29 August 2022. The emoluments of the Vice-Chancellor above exclude employer’s social security.
     The Vice Chancellor was not a member of the USS pension scheme and therefore there were no employer contributions in 2022/23. The
     University made a benefit replacement payment in lieu of pension contributions to USS.
     There is dedicated Executive accommodation within the Nelson building operated by Conference Aston Limited. This can be generally
     used for ad hoc overnight accommodation. This is not a standard hotel room, and as such there is no direct loss of income from this
     arrangement. Valuation of this benefit is complex and has been broken down into three elements: rateable value per annum of the
     apartment (£5,685); value of any furniture provided (determined as 20% of the purchase cost of any furniture, this gives a benefit value
     of £1,137 per annum); and value of utilities provided (an apportionment of the overall building cost results in a benefit value of £1,977 per
     annum). This gives an overall benefit per annum of £8,799. The Vice-Chancellor had access to this accommodation during the year. The
     figures included above within relocation costs and living accommodation represent the estimated non-business use of this facility by the
     Vice-Chancellor during the financial year. It has been assumed that 180 days have been utilised by the Vice Chancellor for non-business
     use. Of this amount three quarters (£3,525) has been allocated to relocation and the balance (£1,175) to living accommodation.
     The performance of the Vice-Chancellor was monitored throughout his employment including through 1:1 performance appraisals
     with the Chair of Council. The University does not have an Executive Bonus Scheme.
     In setting the pay of the Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Workforce Strategy Committee used a variety of benchmark data sets to
     get a rounded picture of what fair and competitive total pay looks like for the role at Aston University. The primary comparison was
     carried out using several different data points including the annual UCEA Senior Staff Remuneration Report and the CUC Survey of
     Vice Chancellors Remuneration Report which provide a picture of where the incumbent sat relative to the wider Higher Education
     Sector and other HEIs. The conclusion of that comparison determined that the base and total reward for the role at Aston were fairly
     positioned against the market.                                               
     Additionally, the Remuneration Committee commissioned an independent external review of senior remuneration against the wider
     private and public sectors to provide a benchmark of levels of pay for senior roles found in these markets. This analysis similarly
     concluded that the remuneration of the Vice-Chancellor was fair, appropriate and justifiable.

   The published total planned expenditure in the University’s Access and Participation Plan for the year ended 31 July 2023 was
   £1,003,732 rather than the published £85,812. Therefore, ‘planned’ University expenditure was £3,365,322 for the year ended 31 July
   2023. Details of the approved 2020-2025 plan can be found at https://www.aston.ac.uk/sites/default/files/astonuniversity-app-2020-2025.

   Actual spend was £3,812,052 (£446,730 over target). Within this there were underspends in planned Access Investment and Financial

Notes to the Accounts  (Continued)                                           
     For the year ended 31 July 2023                                              
                                                                                  
     26. Pension schemes                                                          
                                                                                  
     Accounting for retirement benefits                                           
     The three principal pension schemes for the University’s staff are the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), Scottish Widows Pension
     Scheme (SWPS) and Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). AUPS is now a closed scheme to new entrants and future accrual and all
     existing members now have deferred benefits.                                 
     AUPS is a defined benefit scheme which was externally funded and for the period up to 5 April 2016 was contracted out of the State
     Second Pension (S2P). From 6 April 2016, contracting out ceased with the introduction of the Government’s new state pension. The fund is
     valued every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries. The last formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31
     March 2022.                                                                  
     USS is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the
     scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not attributed to
     individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with
     other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and
     reasonable basis. As required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were
     a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the
     scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will
     fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that
     they relate to the deficit) with related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.
     SWPS is a defined contribution plan, a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed contributions into a separate
     entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension
     plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the year during which services are rendered by employees.
     Employment Benefits                                                          
     Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an expense in the year in which the
     employees render service to the University. Any unused benefits, such as holiday entitlements earned but not taken at the balance sheet
     date, are accrued and measured as the additional amount the University expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.
     Significant Judgements and Estimates                                         
     Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial
     statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:      
     Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS)                                       
     The University obtains a valuation from Hymans Robertson LLP who make decisions on behalf of the University on the financial
     assumptions used to calculate the net liability of the scheme. These assumptions include the RPI%, CPI%, salary increases, pension
     increases, mortality rates, discount rate and the estimate of the duration of employer liabilities.
     The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill and judgement in setting these parameters as the pension experts rather
     than suggesting a rate.                                                      
                                                                                  
     Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach and the full actuarial
     valuation will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.       
     Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)                                     
     FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a collection of entities under
     common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and
     represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme
     where the employer has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the
     recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the
     resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that USS meets the definition of a
     multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in
     existence at the date of approving the financial statements.                 
     The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit required in the financial statements has used assumptions on staff
     salary inflation percentages and the percentage change in staff numbers in subsequent years. In making the estimated percentages,
     management considered past movement in salary inflation and staff numbers as well as considering the University’s strategic plans,
     current economic climate and consistency with AUPS assumptions.              
     Aston University has also chosen to apply the discount rate provided by Mercer Limited actuaries in the USS modeller. Mercer Limited have
     used a set of assumptions to arrive at the discount rate with Aston University accepting the set of assumptions as reasonable.

   USS provides benefits for academic and academic-related employees of all UK universities and other employees. SWPS/AUPS provides
   benefits for other staff of the University. USS and AUPS are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded, the assets of which are
   held in separately administered funds. The deficit in the schemes is required to be reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
   movements in the deficit to be reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.

   The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2020 (the valuation date), which was
   carried out using the projected unit method.                                   
                                                                                  
   Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder (defined benefit) assets and liabilities, the following
   disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.
   The 2020 valuation was the sixth valuation for the scheme under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act
   2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their
   technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical
   provisions was £80.6 billion indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.
                                                                                  
   The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below:

Notes to the Accounts  (Continued)                                           
     For the year ended 31 July 2023                                              
                                                                                  
     26. Pension schemes (continued)                                              
     The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based on analysis of the scheme’s
     experience carried out as part of the 2020 actuarial valuation. The mortality assumptions used in these figures are as follows:
                              2020 valuation                                      
     Mortality base table     101% of S2PMA “light” for males and 95% of S3PFA for females.
     Future improvements to mortality CMI 2019 with a smoothing parameter of 7.5, an initial addition of 0.5% pa and a long term
                              improvement rate of 1.8% pa for males and 1.6% pa for females.
                                                                                  
     The current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:                   
                                           2022-23      2021-22                   
     Males currently aged 65 (years)       24.0         23.9

     Males currently aged 45 (years)       26.0         25.9                      
     Females currently aged 45 (years)     27.4         27.3                      
     A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2020 valuation, which requires payment of 6.2% of salaries over the period 1
     April 2022 until 31 March 2024 at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%. The 2022 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan. The liability
     figures have been produced using the following assumptions:                  
                                           2022-23      2021-22

     The employers’ contribution rates are as follows:

     1 April 2024 to 30 April 2038         21.4%

     The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which is funded
     and valued every three years by the actuary using the projected unit method, the rates of contribution payable being determined by
     the trustees on the advice of the actuary. A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2019 by a qualified independent actuary
     (Hymans Robertson LLP). The material assumptions and other data used by the actuary were:
                                           2022-23      2021-22

     Pension increases per annum (pre 1.9.90 joiners) 3.65% 3.65%                 
     Discount rate                         5.10%        3.50%

     Retail Price Inflation                3.15%        3.10%                     
     The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of actuarial assumptions which are acceptable under the
     requirements of FRS102.                                                      
     The FRS102 valuation has used RPI as the inflationary index to calculate scheme liabilities for current members and used CPI in respect of
     deferred members.                                                            
     The current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in the mortality rates, adopting the CMI 2021
     projections with a 1.25% pa long term trend. The assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:

     From 1 August 2013, the University has been required to automatically enrol its workers into a workplace pension scheme if they meet
     certain qualifying criteria, and are not members of any other scheme. Auto-enrolment does not replace the existing arrangements for
     contractual enrolment into AUPS/USS for regular employees. However auto-enrolment does apply to regular employees that have opted
     out of AUPS or USS, or who may opt out in the future, USS pensioners and casual workers. The University has chosen to offer NEST (the
     National Employment Savings Trust) as its workplace pension scheme for its casual workers.

Notes to the Accounts  (Continued)                                           
     For the year ended 31 July 2023                                              
                                                                                  
     30. Financial instruments                                                    
                                                                                  
     Risk management                                                              
     The University operates a centralised treasury management function which is responsible for managing the credit, liquidity, interest and
     foreign currency risk. These financial risks are managed within the parameters specified by the Finance Committee approved Treasury
     Management Policy. The treasury management policy adopts the key recommendations of the Code of Practice on Treasury Management
     in Public Service as issued by Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) as recommended by the Office for Students
     and is reviewed and updated annually.                                        
     The University’s principal financial instruments are cash, investments and loans. The core objective of these financial instruments is to
     meet the financing needs of the University’s operations. Additionally, the University has other financial assets and liabilities arising directly
     from its operations i.e. trade debtors and creditors.                        
     Credit risk                                                                  
     Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the University.
     The University’s credit risk arises from bank balances, investments, student debtors and commercial organisations as customers.
     Management of credit risk is a prime objective of the Treasury Management Policy. At 31 July 2023, the maximum exposure is represented
     by the carrying value of each financial asset in the balance sheet.          
                                                                                  
     The credit risk of liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with investment grade credit
     ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The University’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are
     monitored regularly. The credit exposure is limited by counterparty limits and minimum counter party credit ratings set within the Treasury
     Management Policy.                                                           
     Student and commercial debtors are reviewed on an-ongoing basis and a bad debt provision is made if recovery becomes uncertain.
     If a debtor is deemed irrecoverable it is written off. Increasing numbers of self-funded students from overseas over recent years have
     increased levels of credit risk. Despite this the concentration of risk remains limited due to a large number of diverse customers across
     both students and commercial customer populations.                           
     Liquidity risk                                                               
     Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the University will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Regular monitoring of
     liquidity risk is an essential feature of treasury management activities.    
     Cash flow forecasts form part of the University’s 5 year strategic model and are revised during the financial year. The University policy is
     to maintain a minimum of £10m in on-call cash balances. Excess funds are invested to maximise the return whilst observing the Treasury
     Management Policy limits.                                                    
                                                                                  
     Foreign currency risk                                                        
     Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that unfavourable movement in exchange rates may cause financial loss to the University. The
     University’s principal foreign currency exposure is to the euro. On an annual basis after satisfying euro denominated liabilities the University
     is left with a surplus of Euros. Surplus euros are converted at spot rates or via forward contracts that are used to mitigate the risk of
     adverse exchange rate movements.                                             
     Interest rate risk                                                           
     Interest rate risk refers to the likelihood that changes in interest rates will result in fluctuations of the value of balance sheet items (i.e. price
     risk) or changes in interest income or expenses (i.e. re-investments risk).  
     Financial instruments – fair values                                          
     The fair values of each category of the University’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying value in the balance sheet.

   31. Related party transactions                                                 
   The University’s Council members are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the University’s operations and
   the composition of the University Council (with members drawn from local, public and private sector organisations), it is inevitable that
   transactions will take place with organisations in which a member of Council may have an interest.
   All transactions involving organisations in which a member of Council may have an interest, including those identified below, are conducted
   at arm’s length and in accordance with the University’s Financial Regulations and normal procurement procedures.
                                                                                  
   Related parties were identified by examining returns submitted by members of Council and senior management team members for the
   financial year 2022-23.                                                        
   These financial statements include the following transactions with related parties. No information has been listed for organisations where
   the income and expenditure is less than £1,000 in the financial year.
