As a consequence, most of our students are\n          mature and have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The fact that we are\n          different from the majority of higher education providers in the UK (who mostly teach young\n          undergraduates during the day) often means that Government policy and other external factors\n          have a different, and often unexpected, influence on Birkbeck. As an example, the advent of the\n          Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) policy and the 2012 undergraduate funding changes,\n          resulted in significant shifts in our student profile. As a specialist part-time study institution, we\n          were forced to quickly develop and introduce full-time evening programmes in 2010 as a risk\n          mitigating strategy against the policy changes which did not affect predominantly full-time\n          universities. Our part-time undergraduate population contracted by over 60% with full-time\n          evening degrees compensating for this decline. The College now has around 3,000 full time\n          equivalent (FTE) full-time undergraduates (from around zero in 2009) and 1,400 FTE part-time\n          undergraduates (falling from 3,800 in 2011/12).                         \n          Three external factors have impacted on the College over the last few years and are expected to\n          influence our strategy over the next few years: Brexit; the Post-18 Review of Education and\n          Funding chaired by Philip Augar (the Augar review); and the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme\n          (USS).                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since\n          2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off\n          equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of\n          £5.0 million in 2018/19. The main cause of this was a significant fall in EU students in 2017/18,\n          the first full recruitment cycle after the EU referendum on 23 June 2016. In 2017/18, we\n          recruited nearly 400 fewer EU students than in 2016/17. Although many UK universities\n          experienced a reduction in applicant numbers that year, the effect on Birkbeck was more\n          marked. A high proportion of our students from the EU already live and work in London and it was\n          from this group that we saw the highest fall in enrolments in 2017/18. We believe that this was a\n          direct result of Brexit related uncertainty over employment and residency.\n                                                                                  \n          The trend continued into 2018/19 with enrolments of EU nationals falling a further 200 – a\n          cumulative drop of 30.3% between 2015/16 (pre-Brexit) and 2018/19. In financial terms this\n          equated to a reduction in income of £4.0 million. New enrolments for 2019/20 indicate an\n          increase of 100 student FTEs (18% year-on-year). This is likely to be a “dead cat bounce” effect\n          as students from the EU start their programmes before the UK Government removes their right to\n          loan funding for the length of their study once the UK leaves the EU. It is likely that 2020/21 will\n          be the final year that EU students will receive financial support for their studies and we fully\n          expect numbers to fall drastically from 2021 onwards. Although a fall in numbers is likely, it is\n          possible that charging EU students higher fees may compensate financially although this is a\n          risky assumption. We continue to encourage students worldwide to study at Birkbeck and are\n          carefully considering our options for when we finally depart from the EU.\n          The Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) has come under pressure financially over the\n          last few years as mortality rates increased and market returns fell. The Pensions Act 2004\n          requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective which aims to have sufficient and\n          appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the most recent valuation date of 31\n          March 2017, the technical provisions exceeded the assets of the scheme by £7.5 billion – a\n          funding ratio of 89%. This led to the pension trustee proposing a new deficit recovery plan which\n          increased the College share of the pension liability from £11.1 million to £31.8 million.\n                                       Page 8",

This led to a period\n          of strike action from academic staff in 2017. At the time, Birkbeck was vocal in its support for the\n          creation of a Joint Expert Panel (JEP) made up of representatives from employers and members\n          to review the valuation assumptions and propose alternate solutions which retained a defined\n          pension benefit. As a result, the first report from the JEP led to the USS trustee retaining a\n          defined benefit whilst also increasing employer and employee contributions to reduce the deficit.\n          The JEP is scheduled to provide a second report in the autumn of 2019 which looks at the long\n          term position of the scheme. It was tasked with developing strategies which led to a financially\n          sustainable, affordable and inter-generationally fair scheme. The USS trustee agreed to\n          undertake an extra valuation as at 31 March 2018 in an effort to reduce further contribution\n          increases which had been proposed by the 2017 valuation and to allow for a two-year period to\n          consider the second report from the JEP. College Governors are concerned about the increasing\n          costs of the scheme and the impact it has on both the College and employees in terms of\n          affordability. They are supportive of the aims of the JEP and in particular wish to see a scheme\n          developed which does not require future members to make increased contributions or suffer\n          reduced benefits in order to fund decisions taken today. Inter-generational fairness along with\n          affordability will be the key focus of any College response to consultations on the future of the\n          scheme.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Although USS has required a fair amount of management focus over the last couple of years and\n          remains a risk for the future, we are pleased to note that the Superannuation Arrangements of\n          the University of London (SAUL) was fully funded at the most recent valuation.

As a consequence, not only\n          have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but without significant remedial\n          action these deficits will grow as the gap between staff costs and tuition income widens. We are\n          also mindful that student recruitment in an increasingly competitive environment post-Brexit is\n          challenging and that developing plans based on student number growth alone will be risky.\n          Our institutional strategy commits us to a series of investments designed to improve the quality\n          of our core teaching and research activities and to modernise our material and organisational\n          infrastructure. Cumulatively the goal is to ensure that we keep true to our unique mission and\n          look and perform at a level in keeping with our reputation for excellence.\n                                                                                  \n          Crucial strands of this strategy are:                                   \n                                                                                  \n            •   Student experience review implementation, ensuring that our diverse student body is\n                properly supported to succeed resulting in strong National Student Survey (NSS) and\n                Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF) outcomes;\n            •   Estates strategy for expansion and modernisation of the estate, addressing\n                longstanding issues about teaching space and delivering appropriate research facilities;\n            •   Improved research support infrastructure to cement our place in the top tranche of\n                research intensive institutions at the REF.                       \n                                                                                  \n          None of our three key institutional goals are self-funding. All require upfront investment and the\n          primary gains are in terms of depth and quality and in moving the experience of students and\n          staff on to a par with the comparator institutions against which we benchmark ourselves. Whilst\n          in the long term there will be financial gains - directly through improved retention and research\n          funding and indirectly as a result of reputational impact – these will not be at a level that in and\n          of itself sustains a higher equilibrium.                                \n                                                                                  \n          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with\n          turnover of £100 to £250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we\n          are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost\n          pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and\n          student body adds major complexity and inflexibility to our underlying business model. Provision\n          at the heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue\n          other activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity into 15 hours\n          a week in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be\n          addressed.                                                              \n          More fundamentally, in addition to tuition fee and income, our benchmark competitors currently\n          have significant additional income streams, primarily through campus/facility related income and\n          through knowledge transfer/spin off/commercialisation activities. As we have neither residences\n          nor a science park/innovation hub, we lack these income streams.        \n                                                                                  \n          These comparisons do indicate that in order to function effectively we need to generate\n          additional income streams of our own. Whilst growth based on our existing portfolio is an\n          important part of any recovery plan we also need to spread risk by investing in growth across a\n          range of initiatives.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          To do so, we have looked to our unique mission and unrivalled location and attempted to turn\n          them to our advantage rather than see them solely as drivers of increased cost and complexity.\n          As an institution embedded in the social fabric of a metropolis we are seeking to generate\n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

We are committed to maintaining promotion and\n          recruitment processes which develop and reward talent. We are also making interventions in\n          relation to our equalities and diversity strategy and looking to integrate and support teaching and\n          scholarship staff who are currently on sessional contracts (some on an open-ended basis as part\n          of an ongoing role, others in response to specific and non-recurrent needs). In this context the\n          adoption of an expectations and workload framework for academic staff, alongside\n          appraisal/review, is a significant development which enables us to ensure that we are using our\n          resources effectively.                                                  \n          The issues of complexity, and the incremental layering of new activities onto pre-existing\n          structures as the College has sought to rapidly adapt, identified in relation to teaching is also true\n          for the College’s professional and support services and School-based administrations. Whilst\n          elements of this have been and are being tackled with focused reviews of specific processes, the\n          current situation requires a more holistic externally supported review that focuses additionally on\n          organisation, capacity, capability and resource that will inform service planning and delivery in\n          this new climate. Cumulatively both the development trajectory we are proposing, and these\n          initiatives, do constitute a significant level of organisational change.\n                                                                                  \n          In order to deliver the strategic objectives whilst returning to a sustainable financial position we\n          have agreed to focus on the following core building blocks:             \n                                                                                  \n            •   Rebase staff costs so that the College can return a break-even budget (before\n                exceptional items) with 9,000 students (FTE):                     \n                                                                                  \n                We successfully launched a voluntary severance and early retirement scheme in the\n                autumn of 2018 and achieved recurrent savings of around £3.0 million in staff costs. A\n                review of the efficiency and effectiveness of administration will commence in 2020\n                backed by benchmark data from the Uniforum methodology (a process used by many\n                Russell Group universities in recent years) and it is assumed that further staff savings\n                will be identified from this process. Further academic savings are also likely as we\n                modernise our portfolio and delivery.                             \n            •   Reduce non-staff budgets by £2.0 million from a 2017/18 base and maintain levels at\n                the same cash position year-on-year:                              \n                                                                                  \n                Governors approved a non-staff budget for 2019/20 which (before exceptional items)\n                was £2.0 million lower than in 2017/18.                           \n                                                                                  \n            •   Deliver recovery plan projects:                                   \n                                                                                  \n                A range of new activities and projects were identified in 2019 which aim to maximise\n                returns from existing resources whilst developing income diversification initiatives which\n                build on the unique nature of our position in the higher education sector in London.\n                Each project has a senior member of staff tasked with delivery and all support the\n                mission and values of the College.                                \n                                                                                  \n          Our prudent financial forecasts aim to move us from an underlying deficit before exceptional\n          items of £5.0 million in 2018/19 to a break-even budget in 2020/21, with increasing surpluses\n          thereafter.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 11",

Having demonstrated our teaching quality\n          by achieving a silver award in the Teaching Excellence Framework and our research quality from\n          a highly successful Research Excellence Framework assessment, this coupled with our unique\n          mode of delivery gives us strong encouragement that we will successfully achieve our ambitious\n          plans.                                                                  \n          We were pleased to see a recognition in the Augar report that falling part-time student numbers\n          needed to be reversed. We have lobbied long and hard since 2012 and believe that a lifelong\n          funding scheme that supports mature learners to upskill, change career or indeed to enter higher\n          education for the first time is essential. Although the implementation of the recommendations in\n          the Augar review is uncertain given current political turmoil we have noted the positive\n          statements in the recent letter from the Minister to the Office for Students (OfS) which included\n          part-time and flexible study as one of the governments priorities for the OfS for 2019/20. We\n          look forward to helping to develop strategies.                          \n                                                                                  \n          Although there are positive recommendations for us in the Augar report there are also some\n          uncertainties. A reduction in undergraduate fees where funding directly from students is not\n          replaced by grant funding and the introduction of differential fees depending on subject area\n          would set our recovery plan back. Whilst these two concerns are likely to affect most of the\n          sector, one that could affect the College disproportionately could be the methodology used to\n          monitor value for money (which is also a core objective for the OfS). Our students work during the\n          day, often full time, and as a consequence are time poor in comparison with their daytime-study\n          peers elsewhere. Birkbeck offers working Londoners a unique way to study whilst working and\n          the imposition of contact time metrics without recognition of this uniqueness could be\n          detrimental. We will continue to focus on the development of government policy to ensure that\n          our current and future students are given the opportunities and support that they need.\n                                                                                  \n          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George\n          Birkbeck set out his vision:                                            \n               ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’\n                                                                                  \n          This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,\n          work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer\n          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,\n          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. Within an increasingly volatile\n          operating environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and\n          contribution to science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all\n          of our activities.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

It is pleasing to be able to report that\n          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various\n          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards and honours\n          received during the year.                                               \n          Professor Joanna Bourke from Birkbeck’s Department of History, Classics and Archaeology has\n          been appointed as Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College, London’s oldest higher education\n          institution. The Professorship of Rhetoric at Gresham dates back to the College’s founding in\n          1597, in accordance with the will of Sir Thomas Gresham, builder of the Royal Exchange. In this\n          role, Professor Bourke will continue a 422-year-old tradition of giving free educational lectures to\n          the general public within the City of London and beyond. Past Gresham Professors of Rhetoric\n          include the poets Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis, the historian Sir Richard Evans and the\n          writer and literary scholar Sir Jonathan Bate.                          \n                                                                                  \n          Professor Bourke is a well-known social and cultural historian, a Fellow of the British Academy\n          and outgoing Chair of its Modern History Section and a prizewinning author of thirteen books.\n          She is a prolific public speaker and is College Orator at Birkbeck, as well as a frequent and\n          award-winning contributor to TV and radio programmes.                   \n                                                                                  \n          Dr Antoine Bousquet, Reader in International Relations, was awarded the Science, Technology\n          and Art in International Relations (STAIR) Book Award for his recent book, The Eye of War: Military\n          Perception from the Telescope to the Drone. The Eye of War offers a timely and ground-breaking\n          genealogy of military perception that elucidates the socio-technical foundations of the\n          contemporary condition of “fatal visibility,” in which anything that can be perceived can be\n          targeted with lethal force. In addition to providing a history of global and increasingly granular\n          practices of targeting, the book explores their wider implications for the landscape of\n          international security in the twenty-first century and further reflects on the place of the human\n          subjects within the late modern war machine.                            \n                                                                                  \n          In making the award, the judging committee highlighted “the creativity of conceptual and\n          empirical work, the ways in which the book fractures established ways of reading targeting,\n          including critical engagements” and its exemplary “transversal work across disciplinary\n          boundaries.” The STAIR Book Award is conferred annually for the best book that develops\n          interdisciplinary advances to how science, technology and arts permeate international politics.\n          The award recognises a book that advances innovative research agendas on the intersections\n          between international relations and the politics of science, technology and art.\n          Dr Sarah Lloyd-Fox was awarded the Wiley Prize in Psychology from the British Academy in\n          recognition of her outstanding contribution to the study of infants. Dr Lloyd-Fox recently led a\n          project exploring the levels of brain activity in babies in response to social stimuli such as peek-a-\n          boo and the sound of laughter, finding what could be the earliest marker of autism to date.\n                                                                                  \n          In July 2019, the British Academy also announced that three Birkbeck academics; Professors\n          Susan James, Esther Leslie and Julia Lovell would be awarded fellowships for their achievements\n          in the humanities and social sciences. The three professors will join a group of 1,400 academics\n          who make up the UK’s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.\n                                                                                  \n          Estates                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          The main thrust of our estates strategy is to improve the quality of teaching and ancillary space,\n          to co-locate student activity on our main campus in Torrington Square and to improve research\n                                      Page 13",

The BabyLab scientists have identified the earliest marker of\n          autism in babies, examined the links between Down’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease and\n          investigated the effects of screen time on babies as young as six-months-old. The first project to\n          commence construction is a purpose built ToddlerLab to extend the research of CBCD to older\n          children.                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          The ToddlerLab will be equipped with sophisticated wireless technology which allows toddlers to\n          carry out normal activities while tracking their brain activity and monitoring their behaviour. An\n          example of the cutting-edge technology is a virtual environment known as the “CAVE” which\n          simulates real-world surroundings, such as a farm or a supermarket, and monitors how toddlers’\n          brain activity changes depending on the world around them. Construction of the ToddlerLab is\n          progressing and is scheduled to open in 2020.                           \n                                                                                  \n          In April 2018 the College received planning permission from the London Borough of Camden to\n          renovate and extend a 1920’s building, called Cambridge House, on Euston Road. London-based\n          architect, Penoyre & Prasad, added a copper-clad two-storey lecture theatre to the top of the\n          existing structure to create a flexible and high quality teaching space. The plans also include a\n          café and active learning space on the ground floor and basement and teaching classrooms on\n          the upper floors. The building will add around 440 square metres of additional teaching space to\n          the College building portfolio providing capacity for over 600 students and staff. Construction\n          commenced in 2019 with the building due to open for the start of the 2020/21 academic year.\n          In addition to the new building projects the original Estates Strategy identified two additional\n          projects with an estimated cost of around £100 million – construction of a new multi-storey\n          annex adjacent to our Bloomsbury headquarters and demolition/re-construction of an old\n          extension block in the same vicinity. Further opportunities to improve the quality of our teaching\n          space have since arisen and significant structural works to some of our Georgian buildings have\n          been identified. We also need to continue to invest in long term maintenance, infrastructure and\n          capital equipment. With many competing priorities and a financial plan that is based on\n          consolidation and recovery, the College is carefully considering its position. The key objectives\n          outlined in the Estates Strategy remain valid, and Governors are keen to invest in the estate\n          where it benefits teaching and research, but the timing and scale of estates projects are currently\n          being re-evaluated against affordability criteria. The Strategic Estates Committee will review\n          existing and potential projects during the year.                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 14",

The metrics used were based on data to 31 March 2017 and updated 12 months later. As\n          well as reporting on the gender pay gap. Birkbeck undertakes a full pay audit periodically to\n          provide analysis and recommendations in relation to reward and related management strategies,\n          policies and practices across the institution (most recent 2018). We support the principle of\n          equal pay for work of equal value and are committed to operating a pay system that is\n          transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which rewards staff in line with the\n          College’s commitment to equality and diversity. These reviews analyse pay gaps by ethnicity,\n          disability and sexual orientation as well as gender.                    \n          The gender pay data published in March 2019 for hourly pay and bonus pay is summarised in\n          Tables 1 and 2:                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                   Mean hourly pay     Median hourly pay      Total employees     \n            Female (£)  Male (£)  Female (£)  Male (£)   Female      Male         \n                                                                                  \n               22.91      25.05      20.92     23.28      1,012       901         \n            Gender pay gap 8.5% lower Gender pay gap 10.2% lower Total employees 1,913\n          Table 1: Gender pay gap – hourly pay                                    \n                                                                                  \n          The 2018 figures show an increase in both the mean and median gender pay gap compared to\n          2017, up 0.9% and 5.0% respectively.                                    \n                                                                                  \n          The changes are due in part to the upgrading of the College HR and payroll databases which\n          have allowed better contractual management of seasonal and casual workers. This has reduced\n          the total number of employees who were active at the census point. The population change\n          accounts for a small proportion of the mean gender pay gap but is more significant to the median\n          gender pay gap increase. Another factor was the difference in the average increase of the hourly\n          rates. In the year preceding the census date 40% of female staff did not receive the incremental\n          pay increase because they were at the top of the pay scale, a proportion that is double that of\n          male colleagues. The result was that the mean hourly rate increased by 5.0% for men and 3.9%\n          for women.                                                              \n          Whilst the 2018 figures are not as positive as the previous year, Birkbeck remains committed to\n          further progress on equal pay and has set out both an action plan and monitoring targets.\n                                                                                  \n                   Mean bonus pay      Median bonus pay    Total receiving bonus  \n            Female (£)  Male (£)  Female (£)  Male (£)   Female      Male         \n                                                                                  \n               1,046      1,870       941      1,070       2.9%      2.2%         \n           Gender pay gap 44.1% lower Gender pay gap 12.1% lower Total receiving bonus 49\n          Table 2: Gender pay gap – bonus pay                                     \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck makes a relatively low number of bonus payments in comparison to the wider sector -\n          the sector average is 8.4% of staff receiving a bonus payment, at Birkbeck it is 2.6%. A\n          consequence of this is that outlier payments distort gender bonus pay gap. This can be seen in\n          the 32% difference between the mean and the median bonus gender pay gap. Removing two\n          outlier payments, one female and one male, brings the mean bonus pay gap to 1.2% which is\n          more representative of the recognition practices at the College.        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 15",

Targeted\n          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena\n          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances.

Facility Time is the\n          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union\n          duties and activities as a union representative.

Teaching grant now represents only 5.1% of College income in comparison\n          with 47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in\n          2005/06 to 63.9% in 2018/19 (up by £1.1 million on 2017/18).            \n          Income from research grants and contracts is £4.1 million lower than the previous year largely\n          due to the recognition as income of a non-government funded equipment grant of £3.3 million in\n          2017/18. Although the electron microscope that was purchased was capitalised with\n          depreciation being charged over a ten-year period, FRS102 required that the non-government\n          grant was released in full.                                             \n          A consortium of Bloomsbury Colleges which included Birkbeck, agreed to sell their shared\n          interest in a property to one of the members of the consortium. The property had originally been\n          purchased in part using capital funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England\n          (HEFCE) as a base in which to undertake joint international development projects. The activity\n          became less strategically important over time resulting in agreement to dispose. The property\n          was independently valued and resulted in a profit on sale for the College of £0.6 million once the\n          deferred capital grant and accumulated depreciation had been accounted for. Sale proceeds of\n          £0.7 million were received.                                             \n          Other income has remained broadly static over the last few years.       \n                                                                                  \n          Chart 6 highlights enrolment trends for our main categories of student since 2011/12.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 21",

After much lobbying by the College since the undergraduate fee was increased in\n          2012, we are pleased to see “innovative and flexible provision” outlined as one of the Secretary\n          of State for Education’s strategic priorities for the Office for Students (letter from Rt Hon Gavin\n          Williamson CBE MP to Sir Michael Barber, Chair of the OfS. dated 16 September 2019). In\n          particular, the minister states that he “would like to see the OfS continue to focus on part-time\n          and flexible learning through a set of ambitious plans to deliver real choice and flexibility\n          throughout working lives, and in response to the needs of business.” This of course chimes with\n          our own mission. Further emphasis is placed on the importance of providing lifelong learning\n          opportunities for mature students and for developing funding arrangements which increase\n          student choice. An interim report is expected in March 2020 and we hope that policy decisions\n          quickly follow which reverse the declines in mature and part-time numbers following previous\n          Government decisions.                                                   \n          Our strategy to introduce full-time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be\n          seen in Chart 6. We continue to recruit well in a competitive undergraduate market in London\n          despite enrolments being affected by a reduction in EU nationals. Chart 7 starkly demonstrates\n          the significant impact the Brexit referendum in June 2016 had on recruitment of EU nationals\n          with numbers falling by 18.4% in 2017/18 (the first full recruitment cycle after the referendum)\n          and a further 12.2% in 2018/19.                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 22",

Full-time numbers then fell slightly in 2017/18, partly due\n          to the fall in EU students but also to increased competition as more institutions advertised the\n          new student loan which had originally been announced close to the start of the 2016/17\n          academic year. Recruitment picked up again in 2018/19 with postgraduate masters students\n          representing 28.5% of total enrolments (2017/18: 27.4%).                \n          Income from full-time Home and EU students decreased by £0.1 million as greater numbers of\n          home students offset the continuing fall of students from the EU. Income from international\n          students rose by £0.7 million (an increase of 9.2%) and now represents 7.9% of total income\n          (2017/18: 7.0% of total income). International student income has steadily grown over the last\n          five years and we believe that there is scope for further increases, particularly with the re-\n          introduction of the post-study work visa. Income from part-time students rose by £0.6 million –\n          the first year-on-year increase since the dramatic fall in numbers from 2012.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 23",

This\n          increased to an underlying deficit of £5.0 million in 2018/19 as the College developed plans for\n          recovery.                                                               \n          In June 2019, Governors agreed a recovery plan which aims for an underlying budget deficit of\n          £3.0 million in 2019/20 followed by break-even the year after. Recognising the increased\n          competition for students as the UK leaves the EU, our forecasts have now been set on modest\n          student number growth to 9,000 FTE in two years (2018/19: 8,738). Although our forecasts\n          have prudently capped student numbers against our existing portfolio we believe that there are\n          opportunities. A number of strands are currently being developed including: portfolio\n          development; improved retention; increased application to enrolment conversion rates;\n          introduction of access programmes to facilitate progression to postgraduate programmes;\n          increased focus on international recruitment; development of additional on-line delivery etc. In\n          addition, income diversification initiatives will be developed and we will ensure that all costs are\n          efficiently and effectively managed. The College has a unique mode of delivery so we are\n          confident that our plans will succeed and we will then return to generating annual surpluses.\n                                                                                  \n          The years of generating surpluses placed the College in a relatively strong position as it\n          embarked on financial recovery. The level of cash accrued provided Governors with assurance\n          that revenue recovery initiatives could be phased and that a couple of years of planned deficits\n          could be supported. The cash reserves also allowed us to continue with the first two building\n          projects in our estates strategy: a new teaching building and an annex to a research facility. Both\n          projects are scheduled for completion in 2020 and in addition to capital equipment purchases,\n          represented a cash investment of nearly £6.0 million in the year. The timing and scope of further\n          building projects will need to be reconsidered in line with progress against our recovery plan.\n                                                                                  \n          The triennial valuation of the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) as at 31 March 2017\n          led to increased contribution rates for both employees and employers and the adoption of a new\n          deficit recovery plan. This resulted in an increase in the obligation for the College to fund its\n          estimated share of the pension liability from £11.1 million to £31.8 million. The change in liability\n          increased the charge to staff costs recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income &\n          Expenditure by £21.0 million. As summarised in the analysis in Table 4, the College was already\n          posting an underlying deficit before other gains and losses with the deficit increasing\n          substantially following the inclusion of the change in pension liability. Pension liability increases\n          of three times the 2018 position have been experienced by all members of USS.\n          Having completed the 2017 valuation, the USS Trustee agreed to undertake an additional\n          valuation as at 31 March 2018 and to consider the proposals presented by the Joint Expert\n          Panel (JEP) in their report published in September 2018. The JEP was set up in early 2018 with\n          representatives from Universities UK (on behalf of scheme employers) and the University &\n          Colleges Union (on behalf of scheme members) to review the assumptions used in the 2017 USS\n          valuation.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The 2018 valuation of USS, which incorporated some of the JEP recommendations, was\n          completed after the Balance Sheet date of 31 July 2019. This valuation proposed slightly lower\n          contribution increases than those included in the 2017 valuation and outlined a two-year period\n          in which employer and employee representatives could review the second report of the JEP which\n          considers the long term sustainability of the pension fund (due to be published Autumn 2019).\n          The valuation also outlined an amended deficit recovery plan which reduces the College share of\n          the liability from £31.8 million to an estimated £18.2 million. This is to be accounted for as a\n          non-adjusting post-Balance Sheet event in the 2018/19 financial statements with the positive\n          adjustment being reflected next year.                                   \n                                      Page 27",

They are supportive of the aims of\n          the JEP and in particular wish to see a scheme developed which does not require future\n          members to make increased contributions or suffer reduced benefits in order to fund decisions\n          taken today. Inter-generational fairness along with affordability will be the key focus of any\n          College response to consultations on the future of the scheme.          \n          Posting underlying deficits and undertaking capital building projects is eroding our cash but this\n          is currently manageable given the reserves we have accrued. The USS pension liability is an\n          ongoing risk from an affordability perspective and has skewed the revenue outturn and total net\n          assets posted for the year. Although we have a lot of work to do to overcome our financial\n          challenges, and being mindful of the unprecedented uncertainty in the higher education sector\n          and wider UK economy, we believe that the unique mode of delivery of the College will provide us\n          with many opportunities.                                                \n                                                                                  \n          Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n                                                                                  \n          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to\n          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit\n          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key\n          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main\n          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        \n                                                                                  \n          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and\n          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,\n          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The\n          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual\n          report on internal control and risk for 2018/19 was presented to the Audit Committee in May\n          2019.                                                                   \n          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved\n          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The top risks for the College for 2019/20 outlined in the annual report are:\n                                                                                  \n            •  Student recruitment                                                \n                                                                                  \n               Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance\n               on tuition fees as our main source of income.

A continuing decline in\n               the number of 18-year olds has prompted institutions that have not previously been\n               competitors to edge into the more mature student market to maintain their numbers. Our\n               recruitment of EU students fell following the referendum and although EU students can\n               still obtain financial support to study in the UK they are choosing not to.\n               The level of risk is likely to stay high in 2019/20. We have controls in place which aim to\n               maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the application, offer and enrolment\n               processes. The Vice Master chairs a recruitment monitoring group and is also leading an\n               admissions and enrolment review. During the year we also introduced centralised\n               admissions decision making for UCAS programmes to improve offer turnaround times.\n                                                                                  \n               Other measures aimed at recovering student numbers include developing new provision\n               to attract new students. The Degree with Foundation Year has proved to be successful\n               and we are putting more resource into international recruitment with a view to increasing\n               numbers for 2020/21 and beyond. We are also working with partners to expand the\n               range of on-line programmes we offer.

A deficit\n               budget was set for 2018/19 and recovery plans have been developed which aim to\n               return us back to an underlying break-even position by 2020/21 (before exceptional\n               adjustments such as changes to the pension liability).             \n                                                                                  \n               In April 2019 the Office for Students published a report titled Financial Sustainability of\n               Higher Education Providers in England which noted: “In a financially challenging\n               environment for higher education providers, and with the UK 18-year old population\n               continuing to decline in the short term, the OfS has particular concerns about the\n               credibility of providers’ student number forecasts. Our analysis suggests that over the\n               next few years the sector in aggregate is assuming a level of growth in student numbers,\n               and related fee income, which is not likely to be achievable.” Analysis of our own\n               enrolment trends concluded that forecasting growth for the College in the current\n               environment was risky and we based our financial forecasts on static student numbers.\n               Having rebased our student recruitment target to the current level with an aspiration for\n               growth, rather than planning for growth, we have focused on efforts to rebuild through\n               careful cost reduction and delivering a range of recovery programme projects. The\n               projects are ambitious and will not produce increased student numbers or income\n               immediately but their successful delivery is critical to planned financial recovery. To\n               mitigate the risk of projects being delayed or not delivering the forecast returns, project\n               leads have been appointed and progress is being monitored by a group chaired by the\n               Vice Master. Regular reports are provided to the Strategic Planning Committee and\n               Governors.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n               In light of our strategy not to plan for increased student numbers our need to reduce\n               costs has strengthened. We introduced a Voluntary Severance and Early Retirement\n               Scheme in 2018/19 which succeeded in reducing staff costs by around £3.0 million.

The\n               governance structure for overseeing major estates and infrastructure projects has\n               changed slightly for 2019/20 with the Strategic Estates Committee (a majority Governor\n               and Governor chaired committee) replacing the Estates Committee (a majority executive\n               and executive chaired committee). With a range of aspirational and critical projects to\n               consider in a financially tricky period, we believe that the new committee will provide the\n               robust challenge and oversight required.                           \n               Project Boards (membership: internal clients, Estates staff, representatives from the\n               external design teams, senior College staff and independent Governors) remain in place\n               for the building projects under way and they will feed in to the Strategic Estates\n               Committee. The Finance & General Purposes and Audit committees continue to oversee\n               the financial and risk management aspects of building and infrastructure projects and\n               the management of major projects is routinely reviewed by our internal auditor.\n                                                                                  \n               It is our aim that all Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck\n               facilities or in buildings shared with other HE institutions. As a consequence, we are\n               looking for further opportunities to increase the amount of space meeting this objective.\n               Some of our Georgian buildings require major remedial works and we need to ensure that\n               our space is appropriate for the continuing delivery of high quality research. The risks\n               associated with the delivery (or non-delivery given the financial position of the College) of\n               the Estates Strategy have been assigned an overall net score of 12.25 (amber).\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 30",

The Act describes 13\n          broad areas of charitable activity. The Governing Body has regard to the Charity Commission’s\n          guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in the following manner.\n                                                                                  \n          The advancement of education                                            \n                                                                                  \n          The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for\n          the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and\n          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills\n          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including\n          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and\n          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual\n          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   \n          The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins\n          everything we do.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in\n          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in\n          the Charities Act (see below for examples).

It also\n          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.\n          Birkbeck is an evening university, predominantly delivering teaching in the evening, retaining our\n          historic mission to educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its\n          doors to people who may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to\n          enabling access for mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of\n          younger students, through our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a\n          widening access institution and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming\n          from under-represented groups. We remain committed to driving this agenda in the higher\n          education sector.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students\n          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are BAME\n          or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 93% of our part-time\n          students and 67% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who\n          wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities\n          for students who otherwise would not be able to study.                  \n                                                                                  \n          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have\n          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that\n          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes\n          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time\n          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and\n          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to\n          continue with our current approach on access.                           \n          The following sections are taken from the College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to\n          2024/25 as examples which demonstrate our performance against various measures in recent\n          years.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Higher education participation, household income, or socioeconomic status\n                                                                                  \n          We believe that providing part-time and flexible education can facilitate social and economic\n          mobility and we have a long and proud history of enabling learners who may not have previously\n          had the opportunity, to access degree-level study.                      \n                                                                                  \n          The standard measure of participation, POLAR3/4, does not work well in London, with very few\n          postcodes falling into the lowest quintiles despite London having significant areas of deprivation.\n          We, therefore, use the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) as a more robust measure of\n          the socio-economic backgrounds of our students. 61% of all undergraduate entrants come from\n          the lowest two quintiles of IMD deprivation with our own survey data showing a significant\n          proportion living in households with low annual income - 39% of full-time undergraduate students\n          living in households with an annual income of less than £25,000 per annum and 46% of part-\n          time students coming from a household with annual income below £40,000 per annum.

Our disabled students tell us that our\n          evening provision is helpful to them as their conditions often prevent them from travelling during\n          rush hour or attending morning lectures. It is not uncommon for a psychiatric care plan to\n          encourage a patient to embark on studies at Birkbeck as part of their recovery. We welcome this\n          client body and are committed to providing support to ensure a level playing field for such\n          students, to attain further qualifications and change their lives.      \n                                                                                  \n          When looking at the continuation rates of students with disabilities compared to those without, at\n          Birkbeck they continue at the same rate as, or in the case of part-time, better than students with\n          no disabilities. In fact part-time students with disabilities at Birkbeck continue at a 9% higher rate\n          than their non-disabled peers (in the sector disabled students’ continuation is 6% poorer than\n          non-disabled). This positive gap has been seen consistently over the last few years and is\n          testament to the high levels of support they receive. Attainment of a good degree by disabled\n          students is also higher when compared to their non-disabled peers:      \n          Ethnicity                                                               \n                                                                                  \n          Our widening access provision predominantly targets students on low income rather than\n          focusing on ethnicity but as our work is exclusively in London our approach means that we work\n          with high numbers of students from BAME groups. Consequently, our student body is ethnically\n          diverse. While the BAME proportion of London’s population is 40%, 56% of our full-time and 42%\n          of our part-time undergraduate entrants identify as BAME                \n                                                                                  \n          Continuation and attainment gaps between different ethnic groups at the College are being\n          closely monitored and progress has been made over the last few years. As an example, whilst\n          continuation rates for black students are better than the sector average there is still a gap when\n          compared to all other students at the College, particularly for those studying part time (see Chart\n          11).                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 33",

Despite this considerable\n          improvement, the current gap, and the equivalent part-time gap of 39%, is concerning. We have\n          undertaken data analysis in order to understand this issue better, looking at factors including the\n          age and subject of study of black students. Through linear regression analysis we find these\n          attributes do not have any significant impact on the attainment of black students at Birkbeck. We\n          calculate that just under a third of the gaps in attainment are attributable to entry qualifications\n          and other student characteristics and that there is an “unexplainable” gap of 18% for full-time\n          and 24% for part-time students. Reducing these gaps in attainment is our main priority in the\n          Access and Participation Plan cycle.                                    \n          The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science               \n                                                                                  \n          A unique interactive digital platform that allows users to visually peel back the layers of London’s\n          history was launched during the year.

Compared to a control group,\n          adolescents who trained their working memory using the game reported a significant reduction in\n          depression and anxiety scores at the end of their training with symptom reduction even more\n          pronounced one month later.                                             \n          The findings, published in Developmental Science, found that adaptive training led to an 11%\n          reduction in self-reported depression at the end of training and a 25% reduction at one-month\n          follow-up. Depression scores in the control group were unchanged after training and had\n          increased by 11% after one month.

The study, led by Professors Diane Houston\n          (Birkbeck) and Dominic Abhrams (Kent) along with Dr Hannah Swift (Kent), sampled nearly 3,000\n          adults. An additional survey of minority groups to ensure sufficient numbers to provide\n          confidence in findings was also completed. Published by the Equality and Human Rights\n          Commission (EHRC), the research found that in the last year: 70% of Muslims surveyed\n          experienced religion-based prejudice; 64% of people from a black ethnic background\n          experienced race-based prejudice; 61% of people with a mental health condition experienced\n          impairment-based prejudice; and 46% of lesbian, gay or bisexual people experienced sexual\n          orientation-based prejudice.                                            \n          David Isaac, Chair of the EHRC, said: “It’s very clear that some people are still conflicted about\n          equality and that prejudices still risk fostering discrimination in Britain. It’s disturbing that some\n          people feel comfortable expressing negative views about others – especially members of the\n          Gypsy, Roma and Traveller, Muslim and transgender communities. Openly voicing negative\n          attitudes can hinder constructive debate about the barriers people face and creates divisions\n          and mistrust in society. Understanding people’s attitudes and the extent of prejudice in all its\n          forms is key to unlocking the barriers that may hold many people back. This report sets out a\n          workable model that we believe the government should build on to understand the current state\n          of prejudice and discrimination in Britain. One person's gain does not mean that others lose out.\n          If everyone gets a fair chance in life, we all thrive.”                 \n                                                                                  \n          By bringing together a set of measures of people’s experiences of prejudice and of people’s\n          attitudes, the survey provides the most comprehensive picture available of prejudice and\n          discrimination in Britain, and helps us to understand the impact of prejudice on people’s lives.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 35",

Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to\n          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance\n          against material misstatement or loss.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including\n          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and\n          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of\n          reference. All independent members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the\n          Governors on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.           \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE\n          (now the Office for Students) and the Committee for University Chairs (CUC) for regular\n          effectiveness reviews. The review concluded that the Governing Body, individually and\n          collectively, is effective. The review put in place measures to improve new Governor selection and\n          induction and to give Governors more opportunities for engagement with the College outside\n          formal Governors’ meetings. The diversity of the Governing Body has increased following the\n          appointment of new independent governors through an open call for expressions of interest.\n          The Governing Body agreed to carry out a proportionate review of its effectiveness, based on the\n          CUC HE Code of Governance, in 2019/20 once the new Chair of Governors has started his term\n          of office.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of\n          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. In 2018\n          the Governing Body agreed changes to the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference and\n          reporting protocol, to increase transparency and accountability in line with new guidance from\n          the CUC. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's\n          processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code.

The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance\n          and not merely reporting by exception. At its summer 2019 meeting, the Governing Body\n          approved the risk management report for 2018/19 and the risk register for 2019/20, taking into\n          account reports from College management and the Audit Committee. In November 2019 the\n          Governing Body considered and approved the annual report of the Audit Committee on its work\n          during 2018/19, including a report from the internal auditor.           \n                                                                                  \n          Strategic Planning Committee                                            \n                                                                                  \n          The Strategic Planning Committee consists of College officers with strategic management\n          responsibility. Its remit is to consider College-wide strategic issues and priorities and to advise\n          Governors accordingly. It is responsible for internal planning and resource allocation policy and\n          procedures. It oversees the annual planning and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools\n          and Professional Services on developing plans and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for\n          presentation to Finance and General Purposes Committee.                 \n          The Strategic Planning Committee met nine times during the year.        \n                                                                                  \n          The membership of all of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-6.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 41",

The schemes are accounted for as a\n             defined contribution retirement benefit schemes.                     \n                                                                                  \n             A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the\n             schemes.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 51",

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an\n             expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n                                                                                  \n             Defined benefit plan                                                 \n             Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under\n             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to\n             determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed\n             by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,\n             recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either\n             through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       5.

Any unused benefits are\n             accrued and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused\n             entitlement.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n       6.

Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the\n             corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value\n             and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.\n                                                                                  \n             Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the\n             outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce\n             a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 52",

Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.         \n                                                                                  \n             The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is\n             depreciated as follows:                                              \n             Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                           \n             Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                        \n             Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years                                  \n                                                                                  \n             Leasehold land: the life of the lease                                \n             Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 53",

The provision is currently based on the USS deficit recovery plan agreed\n             after the 2017 actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of future\n             salaries between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each\n             triennial valuation of the scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future\n             salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount.

The College has\n           met, managed and overcome major strategic threats - the loss of 40% of core teaching funding due to\n           government policy change in 2007 and the fundamental 60% decline in traditional part-time study post\n           2012. The College’s distinct mission stands out in the sector: widening access, opportunity and flexibility for\n           students in an environment informed by the best research. Birkbeck is one of only twenty UK institutions that\n           rate highly in both REF and TEF. Delivering successfully on its mission in this environment has required the\n           College to restructure, reposition, re-invent and innovate. The Master’s role in delivering this change,\n           operating in a long-standing, collegial environment, building the widest base of support amongst students,\n           staff, stakeholders and funders, has been vital to the viability and success of the College.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 59",

In\n           calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the\n           duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out in note 29.\n                                                                                  \n           The adoption of the new deficit recovery plan following the 2017 actuarial valuation has given rise to a\n           significant increase in the deficit provision which has increased from £11.1 million to £31.9 million. See\n           also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs. More details on the 2017 actuarial valuation are\n           set out in note 28.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n           Since the year-end, following the completion of the 2018 actuarial valuation, a new deficit recovery plan has\n           been agreed. This amends the existing deficit recovery plan as set out in the 2017 valuation Schedule of\n           Contributions. This new plan requires deficit payments of 2% of salaries from 1 October 2019 to September\n           2021 and then 6% of salaries from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2028. As at 31 July 2019 and assuming all\n           other assumptions used to calculate the provision remain unchanged, this would have resulted in a revised\n           provision of £18.2 million, a decrease of £13.6 million from the current year-end provision. The decrease in\n           provision would result in a lower charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of £7.5 million giving a\n           revised total deficit of £13.2 million.                                \n                                                                                  \n           Other provisions - restructuring                                       \n           During the year the Institution undertook significant restructuring which resulted in £3,308 thousand in\n           compensation, 91 employees. (2017/18: £401 thousand, 20 employees). A provision has been recognised\n           for amounts agreed due to be paid after the year-end.                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 68",

The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,\n           providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme\n           are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are\n           not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore\n           exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of\n           the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by\n           Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a\n           wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents\n           the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery\n           Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution\n           recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate\n           to the deficit) and therefore an expense is recognised.                \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 73",

A group plan consists of\n           a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme\n           is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such\n           as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer\n           has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results\n           in the recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that\n           they relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS\n           102. College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a\n           multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual\n           contributions under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2017 (the\n           valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method. A valuation as at 31 March 2018\n           was underway but not complete. Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income\n           Builder assets and liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities\n           as a whole.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The 2017 valuation was the fourth valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime\n           introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to\n           have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of\n           the assets of the scheme was £60.0 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £67.5\n           billion indicating a shortfall of £7.5 billion and a funding ratio of 89%.\n                                                                                  \n           In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its\n           obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).\n                                                                                  \n           The key financial assumptions used in the 2017 valuation are described below.

This amends the existing deficit recovery plan as set out in the 2017 valuation Schedule of\n           Contributions. This new plan requires deficit payments of 2% of salaries from 1 October 2019 to September\n           2021 and then 6% of salaries from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2028. As at 31 July 2019 and assuming all\n           other assumptions used to calculate the provision remain unchanged, this would have resulted in a revised\n           provision of £18.2 million, a decrease of £13.6 million from the current year-end provision and a lower\n           charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of £7.5 million.       \n                                                                                  \n           (ii)The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL) \n                                                                                  \n           The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the\n           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the S2P.\n                                                                                  \n           SAUL is an independently managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and\n           institutions with links to higher education.                           \n           Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on either a final salary basis or a career average\n           revalued earnings (“CARE”) basis. Following a consultation with members, it was agreed that the final salary\n           section would close from 31 March 2016 and all members would subsequently build up benefits on a CARE\n           basis.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations\n           under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the\n           amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be\n           spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.\n                                                                                  \n           SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by\n           the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The trustees adopt\n           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits\n           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from members’ accrued\n           pension rights to be met.                                              \n           The assumptions used to calculate the Technical Provisions include appropriate margins to allow for the\n           possibility of events turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not\n           completely remove the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the\n           future.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and\n           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.\n           Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new\n           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        \n                                                                                  \n           The funding principles were reviewed at SAUL’s next formal valuation in 2017. The valuation confirmed that\n           there is no deficit to correct and as a result no further recovery plan contributions or provision is required.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n           The trustees and employers agreed that the Technical Provisions deficit at the 31 March 2014 valuation will\n           be addressed by employer contributions of 3% of salaries between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2018\n           (inclusive). As a result the overall level of the employers’ contributions increased from 13% of salaries to\n           16% of salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.                         \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 76",
