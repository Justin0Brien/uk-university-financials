Recruitment Diversification
A key strategy of the University is to diversify
income from multiple markets in the UK,
internationally and across all levels of study.
This is primarily focused on undergraduate students which is our largest single
cohort of 3,000+ new students each year. Our postgraduate student volumes have
grown well during this reporting period, with growth from the primary markets of Asia,
Middle East and Africa.
Our strategy is focused on diversifying our reach and attraction to ensure that our
projected income and student population is steadily balanced.
We have also grown our home recruitment across the main delivery markets
including Degree Apprenticeships, Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and
our online courses, delivered through Aston Online. Our ability to compete for high
quality students is a key foundation of our overall performance and providing a stable
financial foundation.
The rich diversity of Aston University’s students and engagement is a core part of
our DNA. In this reporting year, a good number of our undergraduate students and
postgraduate students have come from outside the UK. Allowing for this, many of our
home undergraduate students come from the West Midlands region, demonstrating
our commitment to the local communities we serve, whilst growing our international
student population through diversification.
Our partnership with Cambridge Education Group setting up our embedded
academic centre called ONCAMPUS Aston in September 2021, has been very
successful indeed. The centre is committed to helping hundreds of international
students every year to gain access to a university degree, by developing their
academic research and writing skills, introducing them to the foundations of their
subjects and improving their English language proficiency.
Our on-campus centre and delivery for students across foundation, year one and
masters programmes have exceeded targets. Progression to further study on Aston
University programmes in the 2022-23 academic year has been excellent. This
partnership represents our long-term commitment to diversifying our international
student base.
Partnerships
We also have strong partnerships with other providers, including NCUK. and work
directly with a number of international universities to provide transnational education
opportunities. This also extends to our ability to support students, partners and
research colleagues, and in creating long-term partnerships through central
government funded mobility opportunities as we transition away from Erasmus
Funding to the Turing Scheme. Each year more than 170 of our students experience
an overseas placement – placing us among the top 10 in the UK for supported
international mobility.

Graduate Success
A key measure of Aston University’s success can be evidenced through
the continual achievements of its diverse population of graduates. We are
renowned for creating work-ready, sought-after alumni who make a real
economic and societal impact.
Employable graduates
Our award-winning Careers and Placements team offer a wide
range of employability support to students throughout their time
at Aston University, and for three years after graduation.
Placements, pre-registration years and work and study abroad
opportunities feature across all our undergraduate programmes.
We support over 1,800 undergraduate students into a
work placement, helping to prepare them for their future careers
and giving Aston University graduates a competitive edge in the
job market.
Employability is embedded into our curricula. We work with
employers to design many of our degrees and the majority of
Aston University courses are professionally accredited.

(Complete University Guide, 2023).
• The Careers and Placements team at Aston University voted
‘best university placement service’ in the National University

Graduate earnings
The 2021 Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) data shows
that employed Aston University graduates have the 20th largest
median salary overall, five years after graduation at £33,400,
compared with £24,900 sector average.
Subject level data in the LEO reveals that graduates from allied
health subjects at Aston University had the fifth largest median
salary five years after graduation at £37,200, which is over
£11,000 more than the sector average (2021).
Degree apprenticeships
Aston University’s degree apprenticeships are developed in
partnership with employers and professional bodies. Learning
relates directly to business practices and can be applied to a
learner’s job from day one – creating lasting benefits for both the
apprentice and the organisation.
Over 1,500 degree apprentices are on-programme at Aston
University with companies including Capgemini, Microsoft, the
BBC and Babcock. Our degree apprenticeships offer a positive
contribution to the development of a company, aiding new
recruitment and boosting existing employees’ skills.

Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that exist The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit
at the balance sheet date and that result in an obligation to pay required in the financial statements has used assumptions on
more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax staff salary inflation percentages and the percentage change
is measured at the rate expected to apply in periods in which the in staff numbers in subsequent years. In making the estimated

been made include:
Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS)
The University obtains a valuation from Hymans Robertson LLP
who make decisions on behalf of the University on the financial
assumptions used to calculate the net liability of the scheme. These
assumptions include the RPI%, CPI%, salary increases, pension
increases, mortality rates, discount rate and the estimate of the
duration of employer liabilities.
The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill
and judgement in setting these parameters as the pension experts
rather than suggesting a rate.
Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the
figures derived from
Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-
employer scheme. A group plan consists of a collection of entities
under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A
multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common
control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such
as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a
multi-employer scheme where the employer has entered into an
agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer
will fund a deficit results in the recognition of a liability for the
contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the
extent that they relate to the deficit) with the resulting expense
charged through the profit or loss account in accordance with
section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that Universities
Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-employer
scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of
the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in existence
at the date of approving these financial statements.

Basic Salary 7.4 4.9 7.6
Total Salary 7.4 4.9 7.5
The median employee salary figure used to calculate the above ratio is based on the annual full time salary of all included on the University’s
payrolls. This includes all individuals that the University includes in its HESA staff record, including any individual service companies who are
deemed employees under IR35.
This excludes agency staff, individuals with honorary contracts where the contract is not deemed to be a contract of employment and
self-employed individuals outside the scope of IR35. Agency staff are excluded as it is not possible with the current systems and processes
in place to identify the equivalent annual salary at an individual level. Agency staff are used for a range of activities across the University,
however, they are often not full-time, are charged for via third parties often on a consolidated basis and the rate charged includes a fee to
the third party and VAT. Therefore, it is not possible to identify an accurate median salary for these individuals.

The Vice Chancellor left the employment of the University at the end of November 2021, and there has been an Interim Vice Chancellor in
post from 1st December 2021 through to the end of the financial year.
Former Vice-Chancellor
The emoluments of the Vice-Chancellor above exclude employer’s social security. The Vice Chancellor was not a member of the USS
pension scheme and therefore there were no employer contributions in 2021/22 or 2020/21. The University made a benefit replacement
payment in lieu of pension contributions to USS.
The performance of the Vice-Chancellor was monitored throughout his employment including through 1:1 performance appraisal with the
Chair of Council. The University does not have an Executive Bonus Scheme.
In setting the pay of the Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Committee used a variety of benchmark data sets to get a rounded picture of
what fair and competitive base pay looks like for the role at Aston University. The primary comparison was carried out using several different
data ‘cuts’ of the UCEA Senior Staff Remuneration Report which provide a picture of where the incumbent sat relative to the wider Higher
Education Sector. The conclusion of that comparison determined that the base and total reward for the role at Aston were fairly positioned
against the market.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee commissioned an independent external review of senior remuneration against the wider private
and public sectors to provide a benchmark of levels of pay for senior roles found in these markets. This analysis similarly concluded that the
remuneration of the Vice-Chancellor was fair, appropriate and justifiable.
Interim Vice-Chancellor
The Interim Vice-Chancellor was an internal appointment that included the adjustment of a range of Executive-level responsibilities,
including some Executive roles taking on interim responsibility for aspects of operational leadership that would normally be undertaken by
the Vice-Chancellor.
In determining the pay for the Interim Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Committee used benchmarking data on Vice-Chancellor
remuneration to determine a fair and equitable total pay position based on the nature, content and duration of the interim appointment.
The performance of the Interim Vice-Chancellor was monitored throughout her interim appointment including through ongoing 1:1
performance review with the Chair of Council.

The published total of planned expenditure in the University’s Access and Participation Plan for the year ended 31 July 2022 was
£1,003,623. The University has alerted the OfS that the Financial Support element of the plan is understated and should be £2,216,313
rather than the published £82,705. Therefore, ‘planned’ University expenditure was £3,126,623 for the year ended 31 July 2022. Details of
the approved 2020-2025 plan can be found at https://www.aston.ac.uk/sites/default/files/astonuniversity-app-2020-2025.pdf
Actual spend was £3,695,593 (£568,670 over target). Within this there were overspends in planned Access Investment and Financial
Support for students. The University did not set any targets for Disability Support, so all spend is overspend. Research expenditure was in
line with target.

The secured long-term loan comprises one loan with Barclays Bank. This loan is payable in quarterly instalments from 2008 to 2037 and is
secured on a building of the University.
The University entered a £40 million unsecured credit facility with HSBC in July 2019. At the balance sheet date £15m of this facility had
been drawn down. No repayments are due until 2034.
As at 31 July 2022, the University is exposed to risks arising from interest rate benchmark reform as LIBOR is replaced with alternative
benchmark interest rates. The quantitative exposure is disclosed above.
The University has applied the Amendments to FRS 102: Interest rate benchmark reform (Phase 1 and Phase 2). Applying the practical
expedient introduced by the amendments, when the benchmark affecting the Group’s loans was replaced, the adjustments to the
contractual cash flows have been reflected as an adjustment to the effective interest rate. Therefore, the replacement of LIBOR by SONIA
will not result in an immediate gain or loss recorded in profit or loss, which may have been required if the practical expedient was not
available or adopted.

Notes to the Accounts (Continued)
For the year ended 31 July 2022
26. Pension schemes
Accounting for retirement benefits
The three principal pension schemes for the University’s staff are the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), Scottish Widows Pension
Scheme (SWPS) and Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). AUPS is now a closed scheme to new entrants and future accrual and all
existing members now have deferred benefits.
AUPS is a defined benefit scheme which was externally funded and for the period up to 5 April 2016 was contracted out of the State
Second Pension (S2P). From 6 April 2016, contracting out ceased with the introduction of the Government’s new state pension. The fund
is valued every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries. The last formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at
31 March 2019. The 2022 valuation is due to be finalised in early 2023 and as such the results of the 2019 valuation have been projected
forward to 31 July 2022.
USS is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the
scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not attributed to
individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with
other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and
reasonable basis. As required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were
a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the
scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will
fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that
they relate to the deficit) with related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.
SWPS is a defined contribution plan, a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the year during which services are rendered by employees.
Employment Benefits
Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an expense in the year in which the
employees render service to the University. Any unused benefits, such as holiday entitlements earned but not taken at the balance sheet
date, are accrued and measured as the additional amount the University expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.
Significant Judgements and Estimates
Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial
statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:
Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS)
The University obtains a valuation from Hymans Robertson LLP who make decisions on behalf of the University on the financial
assumptions used to calculate the net liability of the scheme. These assumptions include the RPI%, CPI%, salary increases, pension
increases, mortality rates, discount rate and the estimate of the duration of employer liabilities.
The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill and judgement in setting these parameters as the pension experts rather
than suggesting a rate. Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach
and the full actuarial valuation will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.
Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a collection of entities under
common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and
represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme
where the employer has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the
recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the
resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that USS meets the definition of a
multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in
existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit required in the financial statements has used assumptions on staff
salary inflation percentages and the percentage change in staff numbers in subsequent years. In making the estimated percentages,
management considered past movement in salary inflation and staff numbers as well as considering the University’s strategic plans,
current economic climate and consistency with AUPS assumptions.
Aston University has also chosen to apply the discount rate provided by Mercer Limited actuaries in the USS modeller. Mercer Limited have
used a set of assumptions to arrive at the discount rate with Aston University accepting the set of assumptions as reasonable.

26. Pension schemes (continued)
USS provides benefits for academic and academic-related employees of all UK universities and other employees. SWPS/AUPS provides
benefits for other staff of the University. USS and AUPS are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded, the assets of which are
held in separately administered funds. The deficit in the schemes is required to be reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
movements in the deficit to be reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.
The total pension cost for the Consolidated Group was:
Year ended 31 July 2022 Year ended 31 July 2021
£’000 £’000
Contributions to USS (excluding provision movement) 19,254 19,187
Contributions to AUPS 930 930
Contributions to SWPS 1,418 1,437
NEST and other pension contributions 50 112
Total Contributions 21,652 21,666
These amounts include contributions due but not paid at the year-end as follows:
Year ended 31 July 2022 Year ended 31 July 2021
£’000 £’000
Contributions due to USS 1,754 1,579

USS
The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2020 (the valuation date), which was
carried out using the projected unit method.
Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder (defined benefit) assets and liabilities, the following
disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.
The 2020 valuation was the sixth valuation for the scheme under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act
2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their
technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical
provisions was £80.6 billion indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.
The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below:
CPI assumption Term dependent rates in line with the difference between the Fixed Interest and Index
Linked yield curves, less 1.1% p.a. to 2030, reducing linearly by 0.1% p.a. to a long term
difference of 0.1% p.a. from 2040
Pension increases (subject to a floor of 0%) C PI assumption plus 0.05%
Discount rate (forward rates) Fixed interest gilt yield curve plus:
Pre-retirement: 2.75% p.a.
Post retirement: 1.00% p.a.

Notes to the Accounts (Continued)
For the year ended 31 July 2022
26. Pension schemes (continued)
The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based on analysis of the scheme’s
experience carried out as part of the 2020 actuarial valuation. The mortality assumptions used in these figures are as follows:
2020 valuation
Mortality base table 101% of S2PMA “light” for males and 95% of S£PFA for females.
Future improvements to mortality CMI_2019 with a smoothing parameter of 7.5, an initial addition of 0.5% pa and a long term
improvement rate of 1.8% pa for males and 1.6% pa for females.
The current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:
2021-22 2020-21
Males currently aged 65 (years) 20.9 24.6
Females currently aged 65 (years) 23.8 26.1
Males currently aged 45 (years) 22.3 26.6
Females currently aged 45 (years) 25.8 27.9
A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2020 valuation, which requires payment of 6.2% of salaries over the period 1
April 2022 until 31 March 2024 at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%. The 2022 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan. The liability
figures have been produced using the following assumptions:
2021-22 2020-21
Discount rate 3.31% 0.87%
Pensionable salary growth 3.00% 2.35%
Staff base growth 1.50% 1.50%
The employers’ contribution rates are as follows:
Effective date Rate
1 October 2019 to 30 September 2021 21.1%
1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 21.4%
1 April 2022 to 31 March 2024 21.6%
1 April 2024 to 30 April 2038 21.4%
AUPS
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which is funded
and valued every three years by the actuary using the projected unit method, the rates of contribution payable being determined by
the trustees on the advice of the actuary. A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2019 by a qualified independent actuary
(Hymans Robertson LLP). The material assumptions and other data used by the actuary were:
2021-22 2020-21
Salary scale increases per annum 2.90% 2.95%
Pension increases per annum (post 1.9.90 joiners) 3.05% 3.10%
Pension increases per annum (pre 1.9.90 joiners) 3.65% 3.65%
Discount rate 3.50% 1.60%
Consumer Price Inflation 2.50% 2.55%
Retail Price Inflation 3.10% 3.20%
The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of actuarial assumptions which are acceptable under the
requirements of FRS102. The FRS102 valuation has used RPI as the inflationary index to calculate scheme liabilities for current members
and used CPI in respect of deferred members. The current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in
the mortality rates, adopting the CMI 2020 projections with a 1.25% pa long term trend. The assumed life expectancies on retirement at
age 65 are:
2021-22 2020-21

Males 20.9 20.8
Females 23.8 23.7

NEST
From 1 August 2013, the University has been required to automatically enrol its workers into a workplace pension scheme if they meet
certain qualifying criteria and are not members of any other scheme. Auto-enrolment does not replace the existing arrangements for
contractual enrolment into AUPS/USS for regular employees. However auto-enrolment does apply to regular employees that have opted
out of AUPS or USS, or who may opt out in the future, USS pensioners and casual workers. The University has chosen to offer NEST (the
National Employment Savings Trust) as its workplace pension scheme for its casual workers.

30. Financial instruments
Risk management
The University operates a centralised treasury management function which is responsible for managing the credit, liquidity, interest and
foreign currency risk. These financial risks are managed within the parameters specified by the Finance Committee approved Treasury
Management Policy. The treasury management policy adopts the key recommendations of the Code of Practice on Treasury Management
in Public Service as issued by Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) as recommended by the Office for Students
and is reviewed and updated annually.
The University’s principal financial instruments are cash, investments and loans. The core objective of these financial instruments is to
meet the financing needs of the University’s operations. Additionally, the University has other financial assets and liabilities arising directly
from its operations i.e. trade debtors and creditors.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the University.
The University’s credit risk arises from bank balances, investments, student debtors and commercial organisations as customers.
Management of credit risk is a prime objective of the Treasury Management Policy. At 31 July 2022, the maximum exposure is represented
by the carrying value of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
The credit risk of liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with investment grade credit
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The University’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are
monitored regularly. The credit exposure is limited by counterparty limits and minimum counter party credit ratings set within the Treasury
Management Policy.
Student and commercial debtors are reviewed on an-ongoing basis and a bad debt provision is made if recovery becomes uncertain. If a
debtor is deemed irrecoverable it is written off. The concentration of risk is limited due to a large number of diverse customers across both
students and commercial customer populations.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the University will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Regular monitoring of
liquidity risk is an essential feature of treasury management activities.
Cash flow forecasts form part of the University’s 5 year strategic model and are revised during the financial year. The University policy is
to maintain a minimum of £10m in on-call cash balances. Excess funds are invested to maximise the return whilst observing the Treasury
Management Policy limits.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that unfavourable movement in exchange rates may cause financial loss to the University. The
University’s principal foreign currency exposure is to the euro. On an annual basis after satisfying euro denominated liabilities the University
is left with a surplus of Euros. Surplus euros are converted at spot rates or via forward contracts that are used to mitigate the risk of
adverse exchange rate movements.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk refers to the likelihood that changes in interest rates will result in fluctuations of the value of balance sheet items (i.e. price
risk) or changes in interest income or expenses (i.e. re-investments risk).
As at 31 July 2022, the University is exposed to risks arising from interest rate benchmark reform as LIBOR is replaced with alternative
benchmark interest rates. The quantitative exposure is disclosed above.
The University has applied the Amendments to FRS 102: Interest rate benchmark reform (Phase 1 and Phase 2). Applying the practical
expedient introduced by the amendments, when the benchmark affecting the Group’s loans was replaced, the adjustments to the
contractual cash flows have been reflected as an adjustment to the effective interest rate. Therefore, the replacement of LIBOR by SONIA
will not result in an immediate gain or loss recorded in profit or loss, which may have been required if the practical expedient was not
available or adopted.
Financial instruments – fair values
The fair values of each category of the University’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying value in the balance sheet.

The University’s Council members are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the University’s operations and
the composition of the University Council (with members drawn from local, public and private sector organisations), it is inevitable that
transactions will take place with organisations in which a member of Council may have an interest.
All transactions involving organisations in which a member of Council may have an interest, including those identified below, are conducted
at arm’s length and in accordance with the University’s Financial Regulations and normal procurement procedures.
Related parties were identified by examining returns submitted by members of Council and senior management team members for the
financial year 2021/22, as well as performing an online check via Creditsafe.
These financial statements include the following transactions with related parties. No information has been listed for organisations where
the income and expenditure is less than £1,000 in the financial year.
