          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Master’s Report                                                         
                                                                                  
          Operating environment                                                   
                                                                                  
          After a number of years of growth in student numbers following the      
          introduction of our full time evening three year undergraduate and      
          one year Masters programmes we were optimistically planning on          
          further growth in 2015/16. The forecast increase in income would        
          cover the higher staff costs brought about by the change in pension     
          and National Insurance contribution rates. The planned budget           
          surplus of £5.5 million (calculated pre-FRS102) would continue to       
          contribute to our reserves which underpin our long term estates and     
          infrastructure plans.                                                   
          However, student enrolments (FTE) were down 8% in 2015/16               
          compared to 2014/15. This reduction was largely due to continuing       
          declines in undergraduate part-time student numbers, which fell by      
          18%, and a smaller decline of 5% in new enrolments to Masters           
          courses.                                                                
                                                                                  
          Recruitment to full-time undergraduate programmes was steady following 5 years of rapid growth
          although international recruitment fell slightly against a plan to maintain numbers.
                                                                                  
          Changing recruitment behaviour across the sector following the removal of the Student Number
          Control has had an impact on our numbers, particularly at the “access” end of the market.
          Expansion in the number of alternative providers in areas such as Law, Business and
          Management, have also had a negative impact. Although we increased central marketing and
          conversion activity throughout the year it became apparent that competitors had aggressively
          targeted students from a wider spectrum than normal. To counter this, we improved the speed
          with which we process applications, are undertaking an extended range of targeted and general
          marketing activity and have increased the financial resource for advertising and conversion to
          ensure that targets are met for 2016/17.                                
                                                                                  
          Under-recruitment of new students resulted in an income shortfall against budget of nearly £6.0
          million in 2015/16. Our budget included a prudent contingency of £3.175 million and further
          adjustments were identified mid-way through the year to ensure that the budget surplus was
          achieved. However, the shortfall against recruitment target will have an impact on future levels of
          income. We are planning to undertake a phased recovery to ensure that our financial strategy of
          generating cash for investment in our estate and infrastructure is maintained.
          The continuing decline in part-time undergraduate numbers is an issue we know HEFCE and
          government are well aware of and the introduction of part-time maintenance loans and further
          relaxation of the ELQ policy should have a positive impact on this from 2018/19. We continue to
          lobby to improve the support for part time students.                    
                                                                                  
          The White Paper, Success as a knowledge economy: teaching excellence, social mobility and
          student choice and the 2016 Higher Education and Research Bill will inevitably have
          consequences for the College. The introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF)
          metrics may have unintentional consequences for us due to our unique mode of evening
          teaching and we will robustly lobby where appropriate.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          The EU referendum decision in June 2016 will affect the whole economy, not just the higher
          education sector, and we are closely monitoring the situation. Regular reports are provided to
          Strategic Planning Committee and Governors. We are mitigating potential risks wherever possible
          whilst also identifying future opportunities which will benefit staff, students and our local
          community. We remain committed to providing support to all our staff and students from the
          European Union and further afield during what is a particularly uncertain time for the higher
          education sector.                                                       
          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
          Birkbeck set out his vision:                                            
                                                                                  
               ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge’
                                                                                  
          This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have made between,
          work, study, culture, research and society. In our third century we will continue to offer
          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,
          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will maintain and develop our
          distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and
          better space and facilities for all of our activities.                  
                                                                                  
          Awards                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards received during
          the year.                                                               
          Professor of Psychology, Martin Eimer, was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in recognition
          of his outstanding contribution to research. He was one of only 42 academics to be elected for
          the fellowship this year. Professor Eimer leads the Brain and Behaviour Lab at the Department
          for Psychological Sciences, where he and his team investigate the cognitive and neural
          mechanisms of visual attention and working memory, and study face perception and recognition
          and their impairment in prosopagnosia (face blindness). In REF 2014, 60% of the Department's
          work was rated in the highest category 4*, defined as ‘world-leading in terms of originality,
          significance and rigour’.                                               
                                                                                  
          Professor Nikolaus Wachsmann of the Department of History, Classics and Archaeology, was
          awarded the Wolfson History Prize for his book on the history of Nazi concentration camps.
          Established in 1972 the £30,000 Wolfson History Prize recognises scholarly works which
          enhance public understanding of history and encourages historians to write for a wider audience
          than academia. As well as his role as Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck,
          Professor Wachsmann is also a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.   
                                                                                  
          The Royal Society of Chemistry Anne Bennett Memorial Award for Distinguished Service was
          awarded to Birkbeck chemist Professor Michael Thompson for “his outstanding contribution to
          the development and recognition of the work of the Analytical Division and its Analytical Methods
          Committee”. The award recognises exceptional voluntary services to the Royal Society of
          Chemistry Analytical Division - typically at least ten years. Professor Thompson’s research
          involves assessing and improving the quality of analytical data, the performance of the
          laboratories producing them, and the development of statistical models and procedures to
          support these activities. The Royal Society was founded in 1841 by a group of academics,
          industrialists and doctors.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          A creative writing alumna has been awarded the Wellcome Book Prize for her 2015 non-fiction
          work exploring psychosomatic illness. Dr Suzanne O’Sullivan, who completed an MA Creative
          Writing programme in November 2015, won the annual award which recognises excellence in
          new works of fiction or non-fiction that are based around some aspect of medicine, health or
          illness. “It's All in Your Head: True Stories of Imaginary Illness” is her first book and explores her
          experiences as a neurology consultant and the encounters she has had with patients who have
          debilitating but medically unexplained illnesses. Dr O’Sullivan claimed her experience of Birkbeck
          “is one I will never forget. I was exposed to ways of thinking about reading and writing that I had
          never thought about before. There is no doubt that I can view my own writing more critically now,
          but without a sense that my individuality or creativity has been stymied.”
          Two alumni of Birkbeck, as well as the College’s Chair of Governors, were recognised in the
          Queen’s New Year honours list. Harvey McGrath, Chair of Governors, was awarded a knighthood
          for services to economic growth and public life. With a long and distinguished career in business,
          having served as Chair of both the Man Group and Prudential, he has promoted philanthropy
          across London for many years, including serving as the Chairman of Big Society Capital.
                                                                                  
          Fellow of the College and former Liberal Democrat MP for Kingston and Surbiton Ed Davey was
          also awarded a knighthood for political and public service. Sir Ed studied a Master’s degree in
          Economics at Birkbeck and latterly served in the last Government as Secretary of State for
          Energy and Climate Change.                                              
                                                                                  
          Finally, Daniel Peltz, was awarded an OBE for services to charity and philanthropy. Daniel funded
          the restoration of the Peltz Gallery in Birkbeck’s School of Arts, a space which has become a
          flexible exhibition space enabling creative activities to happen at the heart of the School.
                                                                                  
          Teaching excellence                                                     
          We are committed not only to teaching excellence, but to the innovative organization and flexible
          delivery of our teaching in ways that genuinely respond to the needs of our students. Teaching
          activity is absolutely critical both in terms of mission and financial stability. Student fee income in
          2015/16 constituted nearly 63% of our total income compared to 18% for funding council
          grants, 9% for research grants and 8% for other income.                 
                                                                                  
          To improve the student experience we are developing an estates strategy which aims to improve
          the quality of teaching and ancillary space and co-locate student activity on our main campus in
          Torrington Square. It is now a strategic objective that by our 200th anniversary in 2023 all
          Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or in facilities shared
          with other HE institutions.                                             
                                                                                  
          Our strategy for ensuring the quality of our teaching is heavily linked to our research activity. We
          submitted 83% of eligible staff to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) with
          approximately three-quarters of their research being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or
          ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). Unlike many universities our research intensive staff also
          undertake teaching.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          The College Research Strategy confirms the point that teaching and research quality are linked:
                                                                                  
          “Birkbeck proudly asserts that it is a research-led and research-informed teaching institution.
          Exactly how this is manifested in practice varies across disciplines and also according to the level
          of teaching. It means that all our academic staff members also carry out research so that even
          when they are not teaching directly on their own specialist topics, their academic understanding
          is rooted in their practice as researchers and scholars. It also means that where opportunities
          arise, students can benefit from direct contact with, and teaching by, individuals who are
          engaged with research in the topic areas of interest, and it means that the curriculum is heavily
          influenced by our academics’ up-to-date understanding of changing research agendas, advances
          in knowledge, and contemporary methodological challenges.               
          Whilst the College is committed to providing research leave and to encouraging academics to
          gain research grants that allow them time away from teaching in order to pursue a research
          project, and whilst it is also the case that some levels and areas of teaching are best delivered by
          specialist Teaching and Scholarship staff, these factors are balanced against the additional
          principle that there should be no separation of the academic community into ‘research’ and
          ‘teaching’ groups.”                                                     
                                                                                  
          Although league tables do not always factor in the implications of our unique evening delivery of
          teaching, it is nevertheless reassuring to note that the College maintained its position in the top
          1% of universities worldwide in the Times Higher Education (THE) league table. We were ranked
          in the 201-250 category compared to 226-250 in 2015. The THE also ranked Birkbeck as the
          50th most international university in the world in a ranking based on the diversity of the student
          body, the proportion of international staff and the level of international academic collaboration.
                                                                                  
          Our work in the Arts and Humanities area (which includes activity in two of our Schools) was
          ranked 52nd in the world in the THE league table emphasizing the world-leading nature of this
          area of activity. This allows us to recruit both senior and junior academics of very high quality who
          in turn contribute to the standard of our teaching and research.        
          In the 2016 National Student Survey (NSS) the College was rated number one in the country for
          overall course satisfaction in five subject areas: Archaeology; Classics; Finance; Geology; and
          Linguistics. Economics and English were rated top in London for overall satisfaction. In general,
          91% of our students in their final year have found their course ‘intellectually stimulating’, with 87
          per cent satisfied with their experience of the College more broadly. 61 per cent of final year
          students completed the Survey with detailed feedback used by the College to continually improve
          the student experience.                                                 
                                                                                  
          We are preparing to engage with the second round of reporting under the proposed Teaching
          Excellence Framework (TEF). Taking part in the exercise will allow us to benchmark our
          performance against the sector and will provide information to enable us to understand our
          strengths and weaknesses. Anticipated metrics are being considered in detail by the College to
          identify areas for improvement. There are, however, two significant elements in the construction
          of the TEF metrics which disadvantage Birkbeck which we have made clear in our response to
          the technical consultation and in lobbying work:                        
                                                                                  
          •    the denominator in the proportion of students in employment or further study includes
               graduates who are not available for work eg pensioners and full time carers. This is a
               change to the way the Destination of Leavers outcomes are usually reported;
                                                                                  
          •    the “London effect” is not considered in benchmarking for NSS results (where London
               institutions tend to get lower scores due to location).

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Another key metric in the TEF is likely to be employability. In this area, we achieved a notable
          success when the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) found that the proportion of
          Birkbeck students in employment or further study six months after graduation was significantly
          higher than other institutions nationally when benchmarked against characteristics such as entry
          qualification. Moreover, Birkbeck also appears amongst the highest ranking institutions in sector-
          wide metrics on graduate earnings.                                      
          Obviously, part of this success is due to the fact that a number of students are in employment
          when they arrive at the College and continue to remain in such employment. Nonetheless, we
          recognize that many of our students study in order to gain their first job or a new position. For this
          reason, we have established “Birkbeck Talent”: an Employment Agency which assists students to
          find work or paid internships. In its pilot year 350 students attended interviews with 143 being
          placed in jobs or paid internships. On the back of these accomplishments, the scheme was
          expanded further and opened up to the entire student body from February 2016.
                                                                                  
          The Birkbeck Talent initiative is one part of our careers and employment activity which also
          involves an in-house service for enhancing career development and employability of our
          students, as well as a work readiness programme sponsored by the J.P. Morgan Foundation. This
          involves a series of events and workshops equipping students with the skills, confidence and
          experience needed for successful career progression.                    
                                                                                  
          These activities involving enhancing the career prospects of our students are evidently central to
          the mission of Birkbeck. They also provide us with the basis to participate actively in the
          development of the Apprenticeships Programme which is currently being strongly promoted by
          Government. The Apprenticeship Programme we are developing will build on our experience in
          working with business and their employees as well as providing opportunities for employees in
          London to gain degree level qualifications. This could involve standard degree programmes,
          perhaps modified to include a project at the place of work or the development of bespoke
          apprenticeship/degree programmes for groups of employers in a particular area.
          We continue to operate robust systems and structures to ensure that high quality teaching is
          maintained and improved. We have recruited a full time Pro-Vice-Master for Learning and
          Teaching to oversee and further develop our teaching strategy. She will be supported by
          academic leads in each of the five Schools to implement and monitor action plans.
                                                                                  
          Teaching and Quality Enhancement Committee oversees the Strategy for Learning and Teaching
          and the operation of academic quality assurance mechanisms including responses to student
          feedback, overview of academic regulations, annual programme review, five year departmental
          review and external examiner procedures.                                
                                                                                  
          Ensuring that we maintain our high levels of teaching based on the international reputation of our
          research staff is an integral part of our business. A number of learning and teaching initiatives
          undertaken with the support of Catalyst funding in 2014/15 and 2015/16 are now included in
          the College budget for future years at a cost of c£0.5 million.

          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Research                                                                
                                                                                  
          Maintaining and developing the research excellence of the College is, of course, central to our
          overall strategy ensuring that our unique population of students is taught by those at the cutting
          edge of their subject who apply research insights to their teaching.    
          The results of the 2014 Research Excellent Framework (REF) convincingly demonstrated our
          position as a high quality research intensive institution. Approximately three-quarters of the
          research submitted by the College was rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally
          excellent’ (3*). This represents a considerable improvement on the results of the 2008 Research
          Assessment Exercise (RAE) when 56% of our research was rated 4* or 3*, paralleling the
          considerable improvement overall in the sector.                         
                                                                                  
          We are committed to the implementation of the principles laid down in the Concordat to Support
          the Career Development of Researchers. The Concordat offers a set of principles for the support
          and management of research careers and, under each principle, an explanation of how it may
          best be embedded into institutional practice. We adhere to the Concordat as a way to maintain
          the excellence of our research environment and to support the development of researchers. Most
          of what we do is already in line with the recommendations of the Concordat, but we shall be
          formalising this through integrating the recommendations into an updated College Research
          Strategy and developing an Action Plan to encourage improvements in our working practices.
          Building on this we are preparing a submission for the HR Excellence in Research Award.
                                                                                  
          The College Research Strategy 2014-19 articulates the way we wish to set about achieving our
          research aims. It is overseen by a Pro-Vice-Master for Research supported by Assistant Deans in
          each of the Five Schools. There is a research strategy group working in parallel with a research
          support group implementing the aims of the Strategy. This includes providing support for
          researchers at all levels, encouraging collaborative activity and partnerships, and offering
          opportunities for research students including doctoral training partnerships with other
          institutions. We are preparing for the upcoming REF informed by the report from the Stern review
          and aiming to at least maintain our 2014 position.                      
          In terms of the financial support for research, it is pleasing to report that despite an increasingly
          competitive environment for project-based research funding, the College’s research income for
          the year remained relatively stable at £10.1 million in 2015/16 (2014/15: £10.3 million).
                                                                                  
          Our success in driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit
          criteria outlined in the Charities Act. Some of the grants which were awarded or completed this
          year are summarised in the Public Benefit Statement starting on page 27.
                                                                                  
          The excellence of our staff and their research successes were responsible for our continuing
          good position in University League Tables. We were positioned 280th in the 2016 QS World
          University Rankings (up from 431st in 2014 and 290th in 2015). The ranking evaluated more than
          4,200 universities worldwide in 42 subject areas. Moreover, for research the College was ranked
          12th in the UK for citations per faculty (16th 2015).

          We also ranked 5th in the world in the ‘Normalized Citation Impact’ (NCI) index within the Best
          Global Universities Ranking 2016 ‘Psychiatry/Psychology’ category. Comprising the total number
          of citations per research paper, NCI represents the overall impact of a university’s research and
          is independent of the institution’s size or age. Consequently, NCI is widely considered a core
          measure of research performance which is used by various evaluation bodies globally. The
          Department of Psychological Sciences high position in the global rankings followed from its
          strong performance in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) where it was rated 5th in
          the UK. The College also scored 8th in the world in terms of its percentage of total publications
          that are among the 10% most highly cited papers. The Best Global Universities Ranking
          compares 750 institutions from 57 countries in terms of their academic research performance,
          plus global and regional reputations.

          Currently a significant proportion of our teaching activity is undertaken in premises which are
          rented from local providers in Bloomsbury. Some of the space is not of the high standard that we
          would like to offer our students and in some cases operational challenges have been
          experienced. It is now a strategic objective that by our 200th Anniversary in 2023 all Birkbeck
          students will be studying either in fully owned facilities or in property shared with other higher
          education institutions.                                                 
                                                                                  
          Having achieved revenue surpluses for a number of years we were able to purchase a building
          called Cambridge House on the Euston Road during 2014/15. A range of options including using
          the building for research, teaching or office space have been considered. A design team are
          currently engaged in drawing up plans ranging from simple refurbishment to demolition and
          construction of a larger building. Either directly, or indirectly through moving staff from existing
          accommodation, the development work will increase the teaching space owned by the College.
          It is of vital importance that we provide the very best facilities for our research as well as
          ensuring that high quality teaching facilities are provided for students. During 2015/16 we
          completed work to upgrade laboratory and associated space for our Earth Sciences department.
          The £1.3 million project was half funded by a capital grant from HEFCE. 
                                                                                  
          We have been planning the development of a new building to house a Toddler Laboratory for the
          Department of Psychological Sciences, building on the great success of the Baby Laboratory in
          terms of identifying early markers of autism, potentially allowing much earlier interventions
          before the onset of the symptoms. Following the receipt of major donations from the Wohl
          Foundation (£1.3 million) and the Wolfson Foundation (£800,000), Governors made the decision
          to proceed with this project. Unfortunately, progress was delayed whilst the University of London
          negotiated with the neighbouring Warburg Institute to gain their approval for the proposed
          scheme since the University would not grant us the site without such approval. A lease has now
          been agreed for the land.                                               
                                                                                  
          Before commencing the next phase of development for this £5.0 - £7.0 million project, we are
          negotiating an extended lease with the University for the property at 32 Torrington Square which
          will abut the new Toddlerlab. Once this is complete we can also develop plans to refurbish this
          building for use by research staff who are currently housed in rented accommodation nearby.
                                                                                  
          In July 2016 we completed the sale of a long leasehold property which was surplus to College
          requirements. The sale price of £5.2 million was confirmed as a good price by external

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          The teaching and research space created from the two projects outlined will go some way to
          meeting our future space needs. A longer term estates strategy is being drafted by an external
          consultant and aims to draw together all the work previously undertaken in relation to future
          space needs, quality of existing space, opportunities in the area for construction etc. The report
          will be considered by Governors in the Autumn term.                     
          Historic spend levels on long term maintenance have been low and there is a recognition that
          this cannot continue. An increased budget has been identified for 2016/17. A ten year plan of
          upcoming works has also been prepared which currently identifies the following potential levels
          of budget required over the next five years:

          The projects identified will be a mix of capital and revenue and the need to invest in maintenance
          of the extension building will be dependent upon our estates strategy (the capital and revenue
          figures in the table exclude the extension building). It is assumed that the extension building will
          be replaced and funding will not be needed in the short term. Significant remedial works will be
          required if we choose to delay the extension building project. Major works are needed in the main
          building such as replacing the roof and windows. It is clear from the schedule that maintaining
          our existing buildings is likely to have a significant impact on expenditure in future years.
                                                                                  
          The College is committed to reducing its environmental impact and along with other Bloomsbury
          College environment partners, SOAS and LSHTM, we were awarded EcoCampus Platinum status.
          This is a dual award which also confers on the partner institutions the Certification to ISO
          14001:2015 international standard for Environmental Management Systems (EMS). The
          EcoCampus initiative was initially set up and funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for
          England in 2005 and is now a collaborative project between Nottingham Trent University and
          Loreus Ltd, an EMS software development & training consultancy.         
          Set up specifically for institutions in higher education, around 30% of the sector is enrolled on the
          scheme. The phased approach means that universities gain recognition for improved
          environmental performance through a series of awards; Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.
          Platinum is the highest award and is equivalent to the ISO 14001:2015 EMS Standard. The
          certification not only recognises the current progress with our environment programme but also
          acknowledges the structures we have in place upon which further improvements can be made in
          the coming years. A schedule of carbon reduction measures is developed each year with a view
          to reducing our carbon emissions by at least 25% by the 2020/21 academic year against a
          2013/14 baseline.

          We are in touch with over 50,000 Birkbeck alumni who are residing all over the globe. They are a
          vital part of Birkbeck’s past, present and future. Alongside our corporate partners, charitable
          trusts and foundations our alumni contributed towards the £1.8 million raised in philanthropic
          donations during the 2015/16 financial year. These donations ranged from regular monthly
          donations to several six-figure gifts and contributed towards funding for undergraduate and
          postgraduate bursaries, academic research, staff posts, employability work, the re-development
          of the new Library Study Space and supporting students with disabilities.
          Alumni were also involved in volunteering their time to aid recruitment, retention and
          employability strategies across the College. There are a number of programmes that alumni can
          get involved in at varying levels of commitment, with opportunities lasting for an hour right
          through to six-month long mentoring programmes. Over 300 alumni volunteered at Birkbeck, an
          increase of over 75% year-on-year. This resulted in 2,947 volunteer hours being donated, double
          last year’s figure.                                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          In July 2016 we received the very sad news that our Deputy Chair of Governors, Dr Ruth
          Thompson, had died of cancer. Ruth was appointed as an independent Governor in 2009 after
          she retired as Director-General for Higher Education in the Department for Innovation,
          Universities and Skills. A career civil servant, she also worked in senior roles in the Department of
          Trade and Industry, HM Treasury and the Department of Social Security. She was a member of
          the Higher Education Policy Institute and in 2014 co-chaired an inquiry for the Higher Education
          Commission on the future financial sustainability of Higher Education. At Birkbeck, Ruth was a
          member of the Finance and General Purposes Committee and the Remuneration Committee and
          took on the Deputy Chair role in 2014. She led the Review of Governor Effectiveness in 2013 and
          co-chaired the Review of the Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics in 2015.
          Ruth made an enormous contribution to Birkbeck in her time as a Governor, combining her
          tremendous intelligence and analytical skills with good humour.         
          2015/16 was another very successful year for the College, both financially and academically. We
          are continuing with the academic and student support developments that are essential to
          creating the best possible environment for our students and we are developing a strategy for
          investment in the College estate, something which is essential for the long term sustainability
          and development of our teaching and research. On the back of a very strong performance in the
          2014 REF we will implement our updated strategy for excellent and distinctive research.
          Although there are a number of significant uncertainties in the higher education sector at the
          moment we are confidently defining our ambitions and vision for Birkbeck in 2023, when the
          College will celebrate its 200th anniversary.

          The Financial Statements presented to the Governors                     
          comprise the consolidated results of the College and its                
          subsidiary. The principal activities undertaken by the Group            
          are teaching and research together with ancillary activities            
          necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include             
          rendering academic services to a variety of educational,                
          commercial and other organisations                                      
                                                                                  
          Conversion to FRS102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
          Ireland                                                                 
                                                                                  
          FRS 102 replaced UK GAAP and aims to provide a modern and consistent approach to
          accounting in line with international standards. A new Statement of Recommended Practice
          (SORP) based on this standard has been developed for Further and Higher Education. Financial
          year 2015/16 is the first set of financial statements that the College needs to prepare under the
          new SORP. To enable comparison of financial performance from one year to the next, the
          statements for 2014/15 have been restated under the new standard.       
                                                                                  
          During the early part of 2015, we commissioned a review of the implications of conversion to the
          new accounting standard from our external auditor, KPMG. They undertook a gap analysis of the
          likely areas requiring review and identified them as: government grants; non-exchange
          transactions; componentisation of fixed assets; revaluation of land and buildings; employee
          benefits – annual leave accrual; and pensions. We do not have exposure to other aspects of the
          new SORP such as joint ventures and service concessions.                
                                                                                  
          Where options in accounting policy were available the College agreed the following:
                                                                                  
              Government grants (revenue and capital) – accruals basis. This is the same treatment as
               required under UK GAAP and matches annual income with expenditure; 
                                                                                  
              Land and buildings have not been revalued. However, an external valuation was obtained
               in order to componentise the assets. The assets were split in line with the valuation
               report but pro-rated to the original balance sheet cost. The valuation report assessed the
               remaining useful life of the building element and the revised lives (which were in general
               longer than the estimates we had been using) were used to calculate depreciation. The
               net effect of revising the lives of the individual buildings was to reduce depreciation.
          We also introduced a new asset category for heritage assets to record various donated works of
          art. The estimated value for these assets is £0.4 million. The donations had previously not been
          recorded as having value to the College. The asset class will not be depreciated.

          It is likely that the new regulations will introduce increased volatility into annual financial
          performance, particularly due to the mismatch between income and expenditure in relation to
          donations. A pension deficit recovery scheme was approved by USS following the most recent
          scheme valuation in 2014/15. Under the old SORP, the total cash amount paid to the pension
          schemes was recorded as expenditure. Under the new SORP, the element associated with
          changes to the pension liability in the Balance Sheet will have a direct impact on the surplus.

          The College contributes to two pension schemes: Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and
          the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). Both are multi-employer
          defined benefit schemes. Under FRS102 we are now required to estimate our share of the assets
          and liabilities of the two schemes with the net liability reducing our total net assets. The liabilities
          have been calculated using a modeller developed by Mercer in conjunction with the British
          Universities Finance Directors’ Group (BUFDG).

          Non-government capital grants are now released to income to the extent that performance
          criteria have been satisfied. For grants with unsatisfied performance criteria, and for all
          government capital grants, the Balance Sheet now shows the balance under Creditors.
          The total net assets at 31 July 2015 have reduced by £44.6 million (38%) largely as a
          consequence of these two adjustments.

          The recurrent teaching grant from HEFCE continues to fall as an increasing proportion of our
          tuition fees are paid by student loans. Teaching grant fell by a further £1.0 million in 2015/16 (a
          reduction of 11.2%) following on from the £2.0 million reduction in 2014/15. HEFCE teaching
          grant now represents only 7% of College income in comparison with 47.5% ten years ago. Income
          from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/6 to 58.6% in 2015/16.  
          Part-time student recruitment remains challenging for the sector and it is hoped that the
          introduction of maintenance loan funding for part time undergraduate students in 2018/19 will
          help to arrest the decline. Income from full time Home and EU students increased by £4.8 million
          (22.2%) primarily as a result of the continuing flow through of higher fee paying cohorts of
          students following the introduction of 3 year undergraduate programmes from 2012. The new
          postgraduate student loan of £10,000 which became available from 2016/17 has led to a
          significant increase in both full time and part time postgraduate taught enrolments (an increase
          of over 50% in full time and nearly 20% in part time numbers compared with 2015/16).
          Other income has remained broadly similar over the last two years with the exception of a profit
          from sale of fixed asset of £3.2 million in 2015/16.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          The analysis of expenditure confirms that the College continues to invest heavily in education
          and research with only 19% of total expenditure (2014/15: 16.5%) spent on administration and
          other professional services.                                            
          Staff costs as a percentage of total income have fallen from 62.4% in 2014/15 to 59.2% in
          2015/16 but this is masked by the movement in the pension liability that we are now required to
          account for. Table 4 summarises the underlying change.

          The year on year increase in gross salaries of 6.0% is a combination of the annual wage increase,
          scale point progression and a part year of increases in National Insurance and pension.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Although the restated 2014/15 balance sheet reduced by 38% when the pension liability and
          deferred capital grant adjustments were introduced (see Table 3) most of the data in Table 5 is
          reasonably comparable year on year. The creation of a pension deficit recovery plan in 2014/15
          depressed the underlying financial performance whilst the sale of property and gain on
          endowments increased the surplus in 2015/16. The College previously targeted a surplus of 5%
          of turnover but the volatility in total comprehensive income requires us to reconsider this metric.
          What is clear from Table 5 is that the College is generating consistent levels of cash from
          operating activities – around 10% of total income. Our strategy to return surpluses of 5% of
          income was primarily introduced to ensure that we generated cash to invest in our future. The
          rationale remains the same albeit that we may want to shift our focus to cash directly (rather
          than indirectly) as a less volatile indicator of performance.           
                                                                                  
          Strong financial management has kept costs in line with budget. Staff costs as a percentage of
          total income rose in 2015/16 due to the increases in pension and National Insurance
          contributions but this increase was in line with expectations. As a research intensive institution
          based in London with no additional income from student residences, the College recognises the
          added importance of managing this metric and has a current target of not exceeding 60%.
                                                                                  
          Despite the reduction in net assets the College is in a sound financial position with a strong base
          for the future.                                                         
                                                                                  
          Risk Management                                                         
                                                                                  
          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  
          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to
          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit
          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key
          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main
          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        
                                                                                  
          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and
          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and
          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,
          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The
          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual
          report on internal control and risk for 2015/16 was presented to the Audit Committee in May
          2016.                                                                   
                                                                                  
          The College introduced a new scoring system for the risk register in 2015/16. We have now
          assessed and scored risks using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk which can be achieved
          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          The top four risks for the College for 2016/17 outlined in the annual report are:
                                                                                  
              Financial sustainability                                           
                                                                                  
               Financial sustainability has been a long-standing top risk for the College. In 2015 an
               objective was agreed to return surpluses of 5-7% for the next five years. A recruitment
               cycle that was worse than expected meant that student recruitment and income targets
               for 2015/16 were not met. In-year budget adjustments were made which led to the
               budget surplus for the year being exceeded but the College will need to take action to
               recover the income lost through lower recruitment of undergraduate students in
               2015/16. A staged return to sustainable surpluses above 5% of income is currently
               planned from 2016/17 onwards.                                      
               The dimensions of the financial sustainability risk include the potential inability to
               maintain income, which is linked with the student recruitment risk; inability to control
               staff costs; and inability to control non-staff costs. While the risk is well managed through
               financial planning, improved budget reporting and income and debt management, which
               has allowed prompt action to be taken this year to maintain the target surplus, the
               uncertainty around student recruitment and income and the challenge of ensuring target
               surpluses in future means that financial sustainability remains a top risk, with an overall
               increased score for 2016/17 of 20.25 gross, 16 net.                
                                                                                  
              Estates strategy                                                   
                                                                                  
               The score for the estates strategy risk has increased from 12 gross and 10.5 net to 16
               gross and 14 net, recognising the importance for the College of implementing an effective
               estates strategy to fulfil its student and research related aims.  
                                                                                  
               The College continues to have significant space requirements for teaching students,
               research and other activities. The University of London are developing their estates
               strategy, and taking an increasingly commercial approach to use of the University estate,
               which may impact our ability to secure space in the vicinity of the Malet Street campus.
               Estates Committee meets each term to monitor the progress of projects and reports to
               Finance & General Purposes Committee.                              
              Student experience                                                 
                                                                                  
               An inability to meet the needs of students and delivery of an optimal student experience
               could potentially impact both recruitment and retention, result in lower National Student
               Survey scores with a consequent impact on both reputation and recruitment, and lead to
               students having an unsatisfactory university experience and not reaching their full
               potential. A student services strategy to address and alleviate these risks has been
               approved by College management and considered by Governors, and is being
               implemented.                                                       
                                                                                  
               A National Student Survey taskforce has been set up to consider the results of the NSS,
               identify areas of student satisfaction which need to be addressed, and make students
               aware of action that has been taken in response to their feedback. The Student
               Engagement and Widening Participation Committee is overseeing a number of projects
               aimed at improving the student experience, including projects on personal tutors and
               query resolution.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               Although new services and support are in place, the College’s changing student body,
               with larger numbers of younger students with different needs and expectations means
               that there is still a large degree of challenge around this risk. In addition, external budget
               cuts in other organisations, such as the cuts to the Disabled Students Allowance, will
               increase the range of services that the College will need to provide. The net score for this
               risk is, therefore, maintained at 12 for 2016/17.                  
              Student recruitment                                                
                                                                                  
               2015/16 was the first year that institutions were competing without student number
               controls for undergraduate students. The impact of this competition on recruitment was
               much greater than anticipated, and student number and income targets for 2016/17
               were revised mid-year. The introduction of postgraduate loans in 2016/17 has led to an
               increase in recruitment but it is too early to determine whether this is a long term change
               or previous student demand now being fulfilled due to the availability of funding. The
               College has strengthened its recruitment management and monitoring arrangements in
               response to this challenge, setting up a Recruitment Strategy and Planning Group. This
               group oversees efforts to market courses widely and effectively and improve application
               and enrolment processes.                                           
                                                                                  
               Recruitment has been affirmed as a key strategic priority in the annual strategic
               discussions held by the Strategic Planning Committee and the Governors. In addition to
               additional marketing resource and recruitment process improvements, Birkbeck is
               considering how to expand and develop the existing academic portfolio to attract new
               students. In the meantime the risk score has been maintained at 15.75 gross and 12
               net.                                                               
                                                                                  
          A series of emerging risks for the sector, not just the College, are being closely monitored. Brexit,
          the Stern review of research, the introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework and the
          development of the new Higher Education bill are all likely to impact the College. Even with the
          increased uncertainty in the sector, the four risks above are likely to remain of primary
          importance albeit that the residual risk score and mitigating actions may need to change.
          Despite the persistent challenge of recruiting students in an extremely competitive market our
          financial strategy for the future focusses on a quick return to sustainable levels of surplus which
          generate cash which we can invest in capital assets including our estate.
                                                                                  
          On behalf of the Governing Body, I would like to thank all staff for their dedication and support in
          ensuring the success of Birkbeck and its unique mission as a research-led teaching institution
          with a strong commitment to flexible patterns of teaching.

          Public Benefit Statement                                                
                                                                                  
          The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:                         
                                                                                  
          “The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
          who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
          instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
          any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
          may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
          As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
          required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Governing Body has
          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in
          the following manner.                                                   
                                                                                  
          The College aims to provide higher education opportunities to people who would not otherwise
          have access, continuing the mission since its inception. The College’s founder, George Birkbeck,
          had a vision of the power of education to transform and improve lives, and this founding
          commitment to social change and widening access is a core strand of what still drives the
          College today. The College’s mission includes “enabling students from diverse social and
          educational backgrounds to participate”. As London’s only specialist provider of flexible evening
          higher education, Birkbeck has long encouraged applications from students without traditional
          qualifications or from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. 
                                                                                  
          We attract a very high proportion of students with low incomes. The most recent monitoring
          return to the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) for 2014/15 indicated that 47% of our full time
          undergraduate students were from households with an income of under £25,000 and 39% of
          part time students. These students received a Birkbeck bursary to support their study. The
          ethnicity of our students demonstrates that we are attracting a very diverse student body, with
          57% of our full-time undergraduate students from BME backgrounds (2014/15: 59%). 15% of
          our students (19% of our full time undergraduates) declared that they had a disability (2014/15:
          14%; 19% full time undergraduate).                                      
                                                                                  
          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by
          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In
          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.
          We also offer self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free
          monthly instalments over the academic year.                             
          As well as the expenditure on financial support, we spend considerable amounts on ensuring that
          our students are successful while they are with us, and that they are well placed in the jobs
          market on graduation. Our evening provision uniquely enables students to combine study in the
          evening with meaningful work during the day. In order to support students to gain paid and
          relevant job placements we have invested in our capacity to provide a particular type of careers
          support and a new service to create job brokerage called Birkbeck Talent.
                                                                                  
          We will continue to invest significantly in activities which support student access, progression,
          success and employability.

          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
          the Charities Act. The following table summarises our research income over the last four years
          (prior to 2014/15 data prepared under the old SORP):

          The following examples highlight how our research contributes to a range of public benefit
          criteria.                                                               
                                                                                  
          The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science               
                                                                                  
          Dr Fiona Candlin, Reader in Museum Studies, and Alex Poulovassilis, Professor of Computer
          Science, were awarded £1,012,460 by the Arts and Humanities Research Council for a new
          project to map and analyse the emergence, character and development of the UK independent
          museums sector from 1960-2020. The project will establish a dataset of the approximately
          1,600 independent museums currently operating in the UK, as well as those that have opened or
          closed since 1960. The new dataset will be made freely available on a project website and will
          help funding organisations identify patterns to better understand the sustainability of museums
          and how best to use their resources to secure a healthy future for the sector.
                                                                                  
          The advancement of health or saving of lives                            
                                                                                  
          A Birkbeck headed study has led to the design of novel anti-tuberculosis compounds, offering
          new avenues in the fight against treatment-resistant strains of the bacterial disease.
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pathogenic bacterium which is responsible for causing
          tuberculosis (TB) and every year nearly 9 million healthy individuals get newly infected resulting
          in 1.5 million deaths. Treatment of the disease involves a harsh course of antibiotics over a
          period of many months. The urgent need for new, shorter, therapeutic regimens and new classes
          of drugs active against drug-resistant bugs drove a countrywide collaboration among researchers
          who specialise in chemical synthesis and molecular microbiology to develop potential anti-TB
          drugs. This inter-disciplinary effort identified a number of promising drug candidates that may be
          able to tackle the increasing antibiotic resistance of TB strains.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016

          The advancement of citizenship or community development                 
                                                                                  
          Dr Melissa Butcher (Department of Geography, Environment and Development Studies) and
          partners from the universities of Heidelberg and Amsterdam documented the experiences of
          women living and working in Delhi and Shanghai. The £88,000 HERA funded project considered
          how the idea of ‘singleness’ reflects social and demographic transformation, the impact of
          globalisation, cultural and urban change in both cities. Using ethnographic, mobile and visual
          methodologies, the research re-positioned singleness as a category relevant to collective identity
          and subjectivity (e.g. loneliness or independence), and as a phenomenon that women move into
          and out of throughout their lives. Exploring the specific as well as similarities in both cities to
          extend comparative urban theory, the research sites are linked by themes of autonomy,
          respectability, precarity and the shifting boundaries between public and private space. Visual
          methods were central to this work and collaboration with artists in Shanghai and Delhi
          culminated in public events in both cities as well as a final exhibition in Amsterdam in September
          2016.                                                                   
          The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of
          religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity                   
                                                                                  
          Human trafficking and clandestine migration are two of the most politically volatile and socially
          pressing issues of the present day. In 2016, Dr Julia Laite from the Department of History,
          Classics and Archaeology secured support from the AHRC to fund a £250,000 project to study
          the history of illicit and clandestine migration by examining trafficking in the nineteenth and
          twentieth centuries. The research will elaborate a global history of trafficking at a time when
          historical perspective is needed to improve understanding of the phenomenon in the present
          day. It will examine trafficking in the context of the history of international crime and wider
          migration control asking how trafficking policy relates to migration control more broadly and how
          it has influenced the development of migration law and enforcement. The research will explore
          the connections between gender, sex, labour, and illicit migration, both in terms of law and policy,
          but also in terms of individual experiences in the past.                
          The relief of those in need, by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or
          other disadvantage                                                      
                                                                                  
          Professor Mark Johnson and his team have secured funds from the MQ Foundation and Action
          Medical Research to support their ongoing research into vulnerable groups of infants. New
          projects worth £500,000 and £200,000 will consider “Attention control training in infants at risk
          of ADHD” and “Identifying neurocognitive treatment targets in infants with Neurofibromatosis
          Type 1”. The research team also contributed to the recent report in the Lancet that parent-
          mediated interventions can significantly improve outcomes for infants at high risk of autism.

          the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Governors, through the Master as
          designated office holder, are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year
          which give a true and fair view of the College's state of affairs and of its income and expenditure,
          gains and losses, changes in reserves and cash flows for the year.      
                                                                                  
          In causing the financial statements to be prepared, the Governors have ensured that:
                                                                                  
           suitable accounting policies are selected and applied consistently;   
                                                                                  
           judgements and estimates are made that are reasonable and prudent;    
                                                                                  
           applicable accounting standards have been followed;                   
                                                                                  
           financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
            presume that the College will continue in operation; and              
                                                                                  
           they are satisfied that the College has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
            foreseeable future (for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the
            preparation of the financial statements).                             
                                                                                  
          The Governors have taken reasonable steps to:                           
                                                                                  
           ensure that funds from the Higher Education Funding Council for England are used only for
            the purposes for which they have been given and in accordance with the Memorandum of
            Assurance and Accountability with the Funding Council and any other conditions which the
            Funding Council may from time to time prescribe;                      
                                                                                  
           ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to safeguard
            public funds and funds from other sources;                            
                                                                                  
           safeguard the assets of the College and prevent and detect fraud; and 
                                                                                  
           secure the economical, efficient and effective management of the College’s resources and
            expenditure.

          The key elements of the College’s system of internal financial control, which is designed to
          discharge the responsibilities set out above, include the following:

               Deans, School Managers, Assistant Deans and Directors of Professional Services;
                                                                                  
              a comprehensive medium and short-term planning process, supplemented by detailed
               annual income, expenditure, capital and cash flow budgets and forecasts;
              regular reviews of key performance indicators and business, operational, compliance and

               budget;                                                            
                                                                                  
              clearly defined and formalised requirements for approval and control of expenditure, with
               investment decisions involving capital or revenue expenditure being subject to formal
               detailed appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the Governors;

              a professional Internal Audit Service whose annual programme is approved by the Audit
               Committee. The Audit Committee receives reports on internal audit activity within the
               College. The Chair of Audit Committee provides the Governors with reports on internal
               audit activity and an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the College's system
               of internal control, including internal financial control.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Corporate governance and accountability arrangements                    
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck College is a body incorporated by Royal Charter. Although the College does not have
          shareholders, and is not a listed company, the Governing Body is committed to achieving high
          standards of corporate governance in line with accepted best practice. This summary describes
          the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in the UK Corporate
          Governance Code (2016) insofar as they relate to universities. Its purpose is to help the reader of
          the accounts understand how the principles have been applied.           
          The Governing Body                                                      
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body (“Governors”) comprises lay members, students, alumni and employees
          appointed under the Statutes of the College, the majority of whom are non-executive. There is a
          majority of lay members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the Governing Body are
          separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.    
                                                                                  
          The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and
          Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities and under the
          Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability with the Higher Education Funding Council for
          England. The Governing Body is responsible for the ongoing strategic direction of the College,
          approval of major developments and the receipt of regular reports from Senior Management on
          the day to day operations of its business.                              
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is responsible for the College's system of internal control and for reviewing
          its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
          against material misstatement or loss.                                  
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including
          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and
          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of
          reference. All lay members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the Governors
          on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.                     
          The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE
          and the Committee for University Chairs for regular effectiveness reviews. The review concluded
          that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in place
          measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more
          opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings.
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of
          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. It has
          asked Audit Committee to keep under review Birkbeck's processes and practices in line with the
          provisions of the Code. The Governing Body has approved a set of Key Performance Indicators
          linked to College strategic objectives and for which benchmarks and targets are being set.
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
          managing the College's significant risks, linked to the achievement of strategic objectives, that

          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee                   
                                                                                  
          On all academic matters the Governors must consider, but not necessarily follow, the advice of
          the Academic Board, which is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the
          College. The Academic Board has a membership of around 150 drawn almost entirely from
          academic staff and the students of the College and chaired by the Master. It delegates some of
          its powers to its Executive Committee.                                  
          Finance and General Purposes Committee                                  
                                                                                  
          The Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&GPC) reviews and then recommends to the
          Governors the College’s annual revenue and capital budgets and monitors performance in
          relation to the approved budgets. It reviews and then recommends to Governors the financial
          regulations and financial policies that are applied to management. It reviews the annual financial
          statements and considers financial strategy. In addition, the Investment Committee is
          responsible for the College investments on behalf of F&GPC.             
                                                                                  
          The Finance and General Purposes Committee met three times during the year.
                                                                                  
          Nominations Committee                                                   
                                                                                  
          The Nominations Committee considers nominations for lay member vacancies in the Governing
          Body membership under the relevant Statute and for Governing Body appointed vacancies on
          College Committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into account the balance of skills,
          knowledge and experience of members and are based on assessment against objective criteria.
          It also considers issues of succession planning and diversity within the Governing Body.
                                                                                  
          The Nominations Committee met once during the year.                     
                                                                                  
          Remuneration Committee                                                  
          The Remuneration Committee determines the annual remuneration of the Master and of
          professorial and senior administrative staff. Lay members of Governing Body receive no
          remuneration for their services although expenses incurred in attending meetings are met by the
          College. Members of the Governing Body who are employees of the College receive no additional
          remuneration for their services to the Governing Body. The cost of living salary increases for all
          staff are determined by national pay negotiations for all universities. The employee members
          have no involvement in determining their own salaries.                  
                                                                                  
          The Remuneration Committee met once during the year.                    
                                                                                  
          Equalities Committee                                                    
                                                                                  
          The Equalities Committee promotes equality and diversity among staff and students across the
          College by:                                                             
                                                                                  
           monitoring College policy on equal opportunities and diversity, recommending the
            introduction of new policy as appropriate and issuing guidelines on new initiatives;
           monitoring developments in legislation and making recommendations for any necessary
            changes required to policy and practice;                              
           developing and ensuring implementation of the College’s Single Equality Strategy and other
            related policies.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Equalities Committee (continued)                                        
                                                                                  
          The Committee makes an annual report on equal opportunities monitoring and developments in
          equality and diversity to the Governors.                                
                                                                                  
          The Committee met three times during the year. In addition the College has initiated a Strategic
          Equalities Review to set objectives and a framework for promoting and monitoring student and
          staff equalities going forward, which will report in 2016/17.           
          Audit Committee                                                         
                                                                                  
          The Audit Committee comprises wholly lay members drawn from the Governing Body plus a co-
          opted member and so has no executive responsibility. Members have recent, relevant financial
          and other appropriate experience. The Audit Committee met four times during the year.
                                                                                  
          The Audit Committee relies substantially on the work of the internal and external auditors, on the
          information provided by management and the response of management to the questions it
          raises.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The remit of the Audit Committee includes:                              
              reviewing the effectiveness of the College’s systems of internal control and risk
               management;                                                        
              satisfying itself and assuring the Governors that satisfactory arrangements are in place to
               promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness thereby securing value for money;
              reviewing and approving the remit of the internal audit function;  
              advising the Governors, as necessary, on the appointment and remuneration of the
               internal and external auditors, and their quality, reliability and effectiveness;
              reviewing with the external auditors the scope and nature of the audit, including the
               report to Audit Committee written by the external auditors; and    
              assessing compliance with the HE regulatory framework.             
                                                                                  
          The external and internal auditors have a standing arrangement to meet with the Audit
          Committee regularly without senior officers present. The auditors also attend meetings with
          senior officers to consider the items listed above and to review plans for the audit process.
                                                                                  
          The College’s internal audit function provides, by undertaking review, independent objective
          assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk
          management framework and the design and effectiveness of the operation of internal controls
          that are intended to control critical business application risks. Internal audit also helps the
          College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating
          and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by
          working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by
          internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews
          are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate
          action confirmed to the Audit Committee. The head of the internal audit has unfettered access to
          the Audit Committee.                                                    
          The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
          dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
          monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
          that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports regularly thereon to the
          Audit Committee.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                    
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Audit Committee (continued)                                             
                                                                                  
          The senior management team and the Audit Committee receive regular reports, including value
          for money reports, from internal audit which include recommendations for improvement. The
          Audit Committee's role in this area is to carry out a high level review of the arrangements for
          internal financial control. The Audit Committee and the Strategic Planning Committee review risk
          and control during the annual compilation of the risk register and report to the Governing Body.
          The Audit Committee also reports on the effectiveness of the College’s management of risks to
          the Governing Body each term. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance
          and not merely reporting by exception. At its summer 2016 meeting, the Governing Body
          approved the risk management report for 2015/16 and the risk register for 2016/17, taking into
          account reports from College management and the Audit Committee. In November 2016 the
          Governing Body considered and approved the annual report of the Audit Committee on its work
          during 2015/16, including a report from the internal auditor.           
          Strategic Planning Committee                                            
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Planning Committee consists of College officers with strategic management
          responsibility. Its remit is to consider College-wide strategic issues and priorities and to advise
          Finance and General Purposes Committee and Governors accordingly. It is responsible for
          internal planning and resource allocation policy and procedures. It oversees the annual planning
          and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and Professional Services on developing
          plans and co-ordinates and integrates plans for presentation to Finance and General Purposes
          Committee. The Committee has established and regularly monitors Key Performance Indicators
          that measure performance against the objectives set. It is also responsible for fee levels and
          scholarship policy and advises Finance and General Purposes Committee and Governors

          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,         
          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London for the year ended
          31 July 2016 set out on pages 38 to 68. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
          in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
          Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard
          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.                           
          This report is made solely to the Governing Body, in accordance with Charters and Statutes of the
          College. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Governing Body those
          matters we are required to state to it in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
          fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
          the Governing Body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
          Respective responsibilities of the Governing Body and auditor           
                                                                                  
          As explained more fully in the Statement of the College Governors’ Responsibilities set out on
          page 30 and 31 the Governing Body is responsible for the preparation of financial statements
          which give a true and fair view.                                        
          Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion, on the financial statements in accordance
          with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
          require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
          Scope of the audit of the financial statements                          
                                                                                  
          An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
          statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
          material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
          whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and University’s circumstances
          and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
          accounting estimates made by the Governing Body; and the overall presentation of the financial
          statements.                                                             
          In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Operating and Financial
          Review to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify
          any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,
          the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any
          apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
          Opinion on financial statements                                         
                                                                                  
          In our opinion the financial statements:

             These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
             Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2015 and in accordance with Financial
             Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
             Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
             requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
             convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
                                                                                  
       2.    Basis of consolidation                                               
                                                                                  
             The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to 31
             July 2016. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union
             as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.

             Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
             Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms of
             the contract have been satisfied.                                    
                                                                                  
             Fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the Consolidated
             Statement of Income and Comprehensive Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.
             Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is
             shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not deducted
             from income.                                                         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure
             on a receivable basis.                                               
                                                                                  
             Grant funding                                                        
                                                                                  
             Government revenue grants, including funding council teaching and research grants, are recognised as
             income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended
             to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income within
             creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more than one year as
             appropriate.                                                         
                                                                                  
             Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
             College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received in
                                                                                  
             advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors
             and released to income as the conditions are met.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2016                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       3.    Income recognition (continued)                                       
                                                                                  
             Donations and endowments                                             
                                                                                  
             Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
             endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income when
             the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is utilised in line
             with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
                                                                                  
             Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
             during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to the
             terms applied to the individual endowment fund.                      
                                                                                  
             There are four main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
          a)                                                                      
             Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective;
          b) Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
             to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College; 
          c) Restricted expendable endowments - the donor has specified a particular objective other than the
             purchase or construction of tangible fixed assets and the University has the power to use the capital;
                                                                                  
          d) Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
             to generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
                                                                                  
             Capital grants                                                       
                                                                                  
             Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
             were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the College has
             satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
                                                                                  
       4.    Accounting for retirement benefits                                   
                                                                                  
             College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
             (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
             primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
             professionally qualified independent actuaries.                      
                                                                                  
             Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
             of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
             contribution retirement benefit schemes.                             
                                                                                  
             A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
                                                                                  
             schemes.

       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)

       4.    Accounting for retirement benefits (continued)                       
                                                                                  
             Defined contribution plan                                            
                                                                                  
             A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed
             contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
             amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
             expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
                                                                                  
             Defined benefit plan                                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine
             its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed by a
             qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
             recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
             through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
                                                                                  
       5.    Employment benefits                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
             expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are accrued
             and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.
                                                                                  
       6.    Finance leases                                                       
                                                                                  
             Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
             asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
             corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
             and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
                                                                                  
             Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
             outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
             a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2016                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       7.    Service concession arrangements                                      
                                                                                  
             Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
             present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
             financial liability.                                                 
                                                                                  
             Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
             charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
             arrangement.                                                         
                                                                                  
       8.    Operating leases                                                     
                                                                                  
             Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
             premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.       
                                                                                  
       9.    Foreign currency                                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
             transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
             are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
             differences arising on translation are recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the year.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       10.   Fixed assets                                                         
                                                                                  
             Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
             losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
             transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at
             the date of that revaluation.                                        
                                                                                  
             Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
             assets.                                                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Land and buildings                                                   
                                                                                  
             Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
             initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
             benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
             life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.         
                                                                                  
             The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
             depreciated as follows:                                              
             Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                           
                                                                                  
             Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                        
             Leasehold land: the life of the lease                                
             Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation until asset is brought into use.

       for the year ended 31 July 2016                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       10.   Fixed assets (continued)                                             
                                                                                  
             Equipment                                                            
                                                                                  
             Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
             equipment is capitalised.                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
             lives are as follows:                                                
             Computer hardware: 3 years                                           
             Equipment acquired for specific research projects: 3 to 5 years      
             Other equipment: 5 years                                             
                                                                                  
             Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
                                                                                  
             Balance Sheet.                                                       
                                                                                  
       11.   Heritage assets                                                      
                                                                                  
             Works of art and other valuable artefacts have been capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
             acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not depreciated
             as their long economic life means that any depreciation would not be material.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       12.   Intangible assets                                                    
                                                                                  
             Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
             software implementations are treated as intangible assets with depreciation commencing once the initial
             phase of development is complete.                                    
                                                                                  
       13.   Investments                                                          
                                                                                  
             Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
             Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
             investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
                                                                                  
             year.                                                                
                                                                                  
       14.   Stock                                                                
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Stock is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value and is measured using an average cost formula.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2016                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       15.   Cash and cash equivalents                                            
                                                                                  
             Cash includes cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts. Deposits are repayable on
             demand if they are available within 24 hours without penalty.        
                                                                                  
             Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
             of cash with insignificant change in value.                          
                                                                                  
       16.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets             
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:          
          a) The College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
          b) It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
          c) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     
                                                                                  
             The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
             pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             A contingent liability arises from a past event that gives the College a possible obligation whose existence
             will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly within the
             control of the College. Contingent liabilities also arise in circumstances where a provision would otherwise
             be made but either it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the
             obligation cannot be measured reliably.                              
                                                                                  
             A contingent asset arises where an event has taken place that gives the College a possible asset whose
             existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or otherwise of uncertain future events not wholly
             within the control of the College.                                   
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the notes.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       17.   Taxation                                                             
                                                                                  
             The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is
             potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered
             by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of
             Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable
             purposes.                                                            
                                                                                  
             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
             included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
             cost.                                                                
                                                                                  
             The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial
             organisation.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2016                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2016                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       18.   Reserves                                                             
                                                                                  
             Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
             which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
             must hold in perpetuity.                                             
                                                                                  
             Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
             therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.      
                                                                                  
       19.   Transition to 2015 SORP                                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
             The College is preparing its financial statements in accordance with FRS 102 for the first time and
             consequently has applied the first time adoption requirements. An explanation of how the transition to the
             HE SORP has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the

           interest. No such tansaction have taken place during the year (2014/15: none).
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           None of the govorners received any remuneration or waived payments from the group during the year
           (2014/15: none).

           The College owns 100% of the shares of its subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Ltd.
           The principal activity of the company is to own and develop a building on the Euston Road. The company
           is registered in England.

           All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any
           significant personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the
           composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations)
           it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of
           staff may have an interest. All transactions are conducted at arms length in accordance with the financial
           regulations of the College. There were no material transactions during the year with related parties (2014/15:
           nil).                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students'
                                                                                  
           Union as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £264,000
           (2014/15: £234,000) was provided to the Union. There were no debtor or creditor balances outstanding at
           the year end.

           Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
           • Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS)                            
           • The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)   
                                                                                  
           Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered

           (i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)                      
                                                                                  
           Prior to 31 March 2016, the scheme was a defined benefit only scheme which was contracted out of the
           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the S2P.
           A defined contribution section was introduced in October 2016. The fund is independently administered by
           trustees. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not hypothecated to individual institutions
           and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The College is, therefore, exposed to actuarial risks associated
           with the employees of other institutions and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
           liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Consequently, and as required by Section 28
           of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the College accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution
           scheme.                                                                
                                                                                  
           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of
           a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme
           is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such
           as that provided by USS. The members of USS have entered into an agreement with the scheme trustees
           which determines how they will fund the net pension deficit in the scheme. The accounting principles
           pertaining to multi-employer schemes require the College to recognise the contributions payable that arise
           from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The
           resulting expense is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure. College governors
           are satisfied that the scheme provided by USS meets the definition of a multi-employer scheme and have,
           therefore, recognised as a liability the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under the
           funding plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.

       for the year ended 31 July 2016

           The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation date”). The
                                                                                  
           valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. Since the College cannot identify its share of the
                                                                                  
           The 2014 valuation was prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act
           2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to have sufficient and appropriate
           assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme was
           £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion. This results in a net
           shortfall of £5.3 billion. The assets, therefore, were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had
           accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
                                                                                  
           The defined benefit liability for the scheme has been produced using the following assumptions:

           Female members’ mortality: 99% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – rated down 1 year
                                                                                  
           Use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience. To allow for further
           improvements in mortality rates the CMI 2014 projections with a 1.5% pa long term rate were also adopted.

           The scheme is a centralised defined benefit scheme which, until 31 March 2016, was contracted out of the
           State Second Pension (S2P). From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the S2P.
                                                                                  
           SAUL is an independently managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
           institutions with links to higher education.                           
           Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on either a final salary basis or a career average
                                                                                  
           revalued earnings (“CARE”) basis. Following a consultation with members, it was agreed that the final salary
           section would close from 31 March 2016 and all members would subsequently build up benefits on a CARE
           basis.                                                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           The College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current participating employer’s obligations
           under the rules of the scheme, but in the event of an insolvency event of any participating employer, the
           amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
           spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the subsequent actuarial valuation.
           SAUL’s statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
                                                                                  
           the trustees in paying SAUL’s benefits as they fall due (the “Technical Provisions”). The trustees adopt
           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits
           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from members’ accrued
           pension rights to be met.                                              
                                                                                  
           The assumptions used to calculate the Technical Provisions include appropriate margins to allow for the
           possibility of events turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not
           completely remove the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the
           future.                                                                
                                                                                  
           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2014.
           Informal reviews of SAUL’s position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        
                                                                                  
           The funding principles were agreed in November 2015 and are due to be reviewed at SAUL’s next formal
           valuation in 2017.                                                     
                                                                                  
           The trustees and employers have agreed that the Technical Provisions deficit at the 31 March 2014
           valuation will be addressed by employer contributions of 3% of salaries between 1 April 2016 and 31 March
           2018 (inclusive). The overall level of the employers’ contributions will, therefore, increase from 13% of
           salaries to 16% of Salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.
