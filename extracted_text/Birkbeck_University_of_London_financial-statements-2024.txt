STRATEGIC REVIEW
Vice-Chancellor’s report
This is my first report as Vice-Chancellor, after returning to the UK from Australia to take up the
role in January 2024. Whilst these are challenging times for our sector and for Birkbeck, my
experience of this first year – the dedication of our staff and the engagement and commitment of
our students – has only reinforced my appreciation of the Birkbeck community and the Birkbeck
mission. We have moved forward this year and continue to do so through our collective effort. I
want, at the outset, to express my thanks to everyone who has made that possible.
About Birkbeck
Birkbeck is a unique London-based teaching and research institution providing access to higher
education for traditional and non-traditional students of all ages. Our students face the reality of
competing priorities and calls on their time. From 18 to 61+ (over 250 of our students were over
61 in 2023/24), they are living their lives with all the commitments that entails. Often, they are
working, have caring or other responsibilities. Our job is to make sure that in doing all that, they
can benefit from higher education, not miss out on it.
Our student body is diverse with 42% from ethnic minority backgrounds, 57% women and 25%
declaring a disability in 2023/24. As well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing
international student community now welcoming students from over 140 countries around the
world.
Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that
proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was
successful in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) return with 83% of our research
being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*).
Student recruitment
In last year’s report we highlighted that building back student recruitment would be the work of a
number of years, not just one or two; this remains the case.
The issues across the sector in relation to international student recruitment were already
manifesting themselves at this point last year and we drew attention to the volatility and risk in
the international market. Following the significant fall in overall new admissions for 2021/22,
2022/23 saw no further decline in recruitment. Whilst this was positive it was achieved to a
significant degree by concerted and successful international recruitment. Increases in
international students mitigated the impact of our home recruitment position as we responded to
major market changes here and got underway with the significant changes needed to our overall
offer and the investment in the infrastructure to support new modes of delivery.
As we anticipated, international recruitment in 2023/24 fell back from its 2022/23 high point,
with 744 FTE new students compared to 1,032 FTE. This was a major contributory factor to an
overall reduction of new admissions from 3,540 FTE last year to 3,045 FTE this. Whilst not
welcome, we were able to respond to the financial impact through concerted financial
management and in-year adjustments to our operating budgets.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
As part of a broad-based repositioning of our course offer and the delivery of our teaching, we
announced specific measures this year designed to impact student recruitment from 2024/25:
• the introduction of daytime teaching in a small number of subject areas where there
is high potential demand;
• the introduction of new programmes to meet emerging demand;
• the development of international recruitment with a focus shifting to partnership and
collaboration;
• and doubling down on action to achieve faster application process and improved
conversion. From offer to acceptance and then onto enrolment.
We have made good progress, introducing daytime undergraduate courses in biomedicine,
business, health & social care, law, management and psychology alongside a suite of daytime
postgraduate programmes initially focused on computing & data science, management &
business and psychology.
We have established new programmes in health and natural sciences plus new joint courses in
business, law and computing. Next year we will add further to our portfolio, focussing on the
environment and artificial intelligence, with that provision drawing on our discipline breadth
across the sciences, humanities, business and law.
Significant strides have also been made with process. The further extension of delegated
admissions, where offers are made centrally by our Registry admissions team, together with
concerted focus on remaining School-based decisions which need input from academic
colleagues, has resulted in far quicker offer-making feeding into faster conversion follow-up. 25%
of our offers for 2024/25 were made in less than a day and we have more than halved our
median offer time compared to 2023/24.
The actions we have been taking are having a positive impact on new enrolments for
programmes starting in October 2024. Whilst the challenges driving down direct international
recruitment have remained, the year-on-year position for new home enrolments is positive, with
an overall increase of 7% recorded at the end of October 2024. New home admissions to
undergraduate programmes which we particularly targeted for growth, have increased by 13%
whilst at the postgraduate master’s level the increase is 1%.
In recent years we began to offer a limited number of Masters programmes with a January start
date and were pleased to achieve growth of 14% in Home enrolments in 2023/24. Although
international numbers fell year on year in this category as well, we are optimistic that further
growth in Home and at least no further falls in international will the outcome in 2025.
Growth in Home student numbers is positive news as we continue with the hard work necessary
to innovate our course portfolio, the way and location we deliver and teach it and how we connect
with the Birkbeck students of the future. This success has been achieved in an operating
environment in which many selective universities increased the number of Home students they
recruited in an attempt to offset the continuing fall in international numbers thereby putting
significant pressure on institutions across the sector.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Birkbeck students are often thought of in terms of their age, but the fact that we have over many
years recruited, for example, undergraduates later in life, reflects the opportunities, or rather lack
of them in the broader higher education landscape and the consequent life choices our students
have taken in response. Things change. Birkbeck students, or rather the students Birkbeck exists
to serve, are not ultimately defined by age; they are defined by the circumstances and the
struggles they face, the ambition they have, and their commitment to achieve it. Whether 18, 28,
or 38, we will find them. Once we do, we need to attract them with the compelling study offer that
fulfils that ambition, matches that commitment and fits with those circumstances.
International
In March 2024 Birkbeck commissioned Cormack Consultancy Group (CCG) to review its position
in the international education market and suggest possibilities for growing engagement. It
reported in June 2024, having considered Birkbeck’s current capabilities and potential future
offerings. The report highlighted that clear opportunities continue to exist for Birkbeck, both to
sharpen our competitiveness in direct retail recruitment and to develop more wholesale
recruitment through collaboration and partnership in specific regions.
We have made some immediate changes to support our direct recruitment in the light of the
review findings whilst the volatility of the international market in terms of individual student
choice, has reinforced the case for the development of longer-term partnership arrangements
less immediately susceptible to economic and political factors and highlighted in the review. We
are making progress, continuing to develop our existing relationship with the UK-based
Cambridge Education Group, who will now provide us with pre and post sessional English
language support, as well as identifying priority countries for partnership arrangements in China,
India, Sri Lanka, and the US.
We are building relationships with education service providers able to provide knowledge,
expertise and capacity to support collaboration with Chinese Universities and in particular the
pathway for applications to the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China for joint
programmes and joint institutes. These arrangements are common in Australia and becoming
more common in the UK. In India and Sri Lanka our strategy is to focus more on institutional
articulation arrangements with students entering Birkbeck year 2 to join existing programmes.
We believe US collaboration can provide an important route to boost humanities and social
science student recruitment at the post-graduate level. This involves US partners for either dual
degrees (a Masters degree from both higher education institution) or progression arrangements
(undergraduate in the US to a Masters degree at Birkbeck). Obviously, the latter is available to
any student from anywhere, but these arrangements offer mapped pathways with some joint or
online teaching on the undergraduate degree to encourage selection of the postgraduate option
and promotion by staff at both institutions. Term or year abroad options are attractive to US
students studying humanities and social sciences and we are working on this opportunity as well.
Current operating position
The 2023/24 total comprehensive income for the year was £24.8 million compared with total
comprehensive income of £1.9 million in the previous year. However, this overall position and
how it relates to last year is impacted significantly by the valuation of the Universities
Superannuation Scheme (USS). The 2023 triennial valuation used updated long-term economic
assumptions to value future obligations for the scheme and determined that it was no longer in
deficit. The consequence is that our share of the deficit recovery plan has been released in full
this year reducing expenditure by £29.7 million (2022/23: a part reduction in liability of £9.5
million).
Page 11

Birkbeck, University of London
Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The underlying position after removing the effect of the USS valuation, staff restructuring costs
and other gains and losses is a deficit of £5.1 million compared with a deficit of £3.5 million in
2022/23. This reflects the ongoing impact of student recruitment magnified by the structural
financial issues that are playing out across the sector (see Table 7). Annual increases in staff
costs - due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and pension costs -
exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by
the government on Home undergraduate tuition fees. The historic resistance by the Government
to increase home undergraduate tuition fees has affected the whole higher education sector in
England. The current fee of £9,250 is now worth less than two thirds what it was when it was
introduced in 2012 and with the impact of recent high levels of inflation the pressure placed on
universities to generate an excess of income over expenditure is intense.
Very clearly a deficit position is not where we want to be. However, the year-end position is
significantly better in relation to our budget and forecasts at the start of the year. This reflects
focussed effort in relation to cost management. We have delivered savings through pay restraint,
vacancy management and controls on recruitment. We have carefully managed staff costs during
the year taking permanent savings where we can and recycling vacancies to better meet future
needs. The net impact of this is that we have managed to exceed the staff savings target of £1.5
million included in the revised budget by some £1.7 million.
Budget managers across the University have continued to be bear down on non-staff expenditure
resulting in reduced expenditure of £3.2 million compared to budget. In addition, our investment
funds have performed well through the year primarily due to increases in equity values. This is
reflected in an increase in investment income of £0.5 million over 2022/23 (representing an
increase of 41.0%) as well as a gain on investments for 2023/24 of £1.4 million (2022/23: a
loss of £0.3 million).
Given the current situation, effective cashflow monitoring and management have remained a key
focus for us throughout the year. Despite an increase in cash outflow from operations to £5.0
million from an outflow of £1.3 million in 2022/23, total cash and investments at 31 July 2024
totalled £46.7 million (2022/3: £49.6 million). The impact of strong financial management and
in-year interventions, coupled with a restriction in new capital projects being commenced, has
allowed us to minimise the fall in cash. We will need to retain a focus on liquidity and total cash
holdings for the foreseeable future.
Organisational change and leadership
On the 1st of August 2023, the University moved to its new operating structure, providing
academic focus through three larger-scale Faculties – Science, Business & Law, and Humanities
& Social Sciences. Each Faculty is comprised of Schools that bring together disciplines,
supporting continuing academic breadth whilst ensuring efficient and effective scale. I am
grateful to all those who worked on the organisational, operational and systems dimensions of
implementing this major change to tight deadlines.
Whilst there was considerable challenge going into the 2023/24 academic with a new
organisation and new roles and role-holders within it, the new structure has bedded in well over
the course of the year. Organisational reform has gone hand in hand with refreshed and renewed
academic leadership. For our Heads of School we have drawn on internal talent but
supplemented this by recruiting externally in specific areas to bring new thinking and perspective
into the management team. These roles, working in tandem with new student recruitment leads
have supported the sharper, concerted focus on recruitment that was one of my key priorities for
the 2024 cycle and will remain a focus into the future.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
In addition to the operation of the University Executive Board, I have established a quarterly
leadership group that brings together our senior academic and professional services leaders.
This group functions to promote common understanding of the issues we face, our priorities for
action, and to develop closer working, understanding and open communication across the
institution. The feedback so far has been positive.
2024 has also seen long-standing members of my immediate senior team– the College
Secretary, the Pro Vice-Chancellor Research and the Pro Vice-Chancellor International - retire or
step down. I am grateful for their service and for their support over what has been an important
period of transition. In making changes to the structure and composition of the senior team for
the future my focus has been to capitalise on, and more closely integrate, the talent of our senior
academic and professional services management and to create functional groupings that align
leadership with underlying resource and dovetail with our urgent priorities.
The major institution-wide areas of strategy – education & student experience, research and
academic & corporate affairs are now each be led by a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, working directly
with the professional services areas that support those activities. In terms of continuity, Diane
Houston continues her work as DVC for Education & Student Experience as does Matt Innes as
DVC Academic & Corporate. We are currently conducting the search for our new DVC Research.
Financial strategy, recovery and sustainability are vital to Birkbeck. Accordingly, Keith Willett, as
Chief Financial Officer, is now working directly to me with a remit that includes Estates &
Facilities and Registry. Our digital strategy and investment in supporting infrastructure are
increasingly central to how we operate, compete and deliver our mission and similarly the Chief
Information Officer is now working directly to me.
Birkbeck is a small institution and in the current climate there are real challenges associated
with that. We cannot compensate for all the disadvantages of size but we can play to the
advantages of our smaller scale. Simplification of structure, management, lines of
communication and operation are all designed to help us realise this advantage. Birkbeck will
prosper by making the right strategic choices, but it needs to act and operate at a faster pace in
turning choice into reality.
Progress with cost savings
The purpose of our 2023 re-organisation was to deliver both a better operating structure but also
significant staff savings within it. We have achieved both objectives. In 2022/23 we delivered
£9.0 million in staff savings, £1.0 million more than the original target of £8 million.
During the year, we completed a major review of our information services, covering both our
library and ITS provision, with the new structure and roles within it coming into effect from 1
August 2024. The aim of the review has been both to deliver savings and to deliver more
effective, integrated provision organised around our future needs. Overall, the annual savings
impact for 2024/25 will be around £0.8 million.
Repositioning our course offer and the delivery of our teaching
We are continuing to invest in, and make good progress in, implementing our Creating Inclusive
Learning initiative, having committed to an £8.0 million phased capital programme, supported in
part by capital funding of £3.0 million from the Office for Students (OfS).

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
This project is core to our strategy to invest in and deliver our teaching through a flexible blend of
campus and digital experience. The driving force behind this initiative is to give our diverse
student community the opportunities they deserve in a form of delivery that recognises their
changing circumstances and needs.
The project has two strands:
• HyFlex teaching– adaptation of our classrooms (particularly in relation to IT and AV) to
enable students to choose whether they join classes in-person or synchronously online
providing a high-quality interactive learning experience in both modes;
• Virtual Reality & Immersive Learning (VRIL) suite – creation of purpose built, co-located
spaces to enhance the range and scope of our teaching and support for the longer term
through the use of modern software and technology. This Immersive Learning Centre will
deliver genuine innovation through new types of course content and new ways of
teaching and interacting with our students.
The project aims are that, initially, at least 50% of our students will have access to HyFlex
teaching events from the start of the 2025/26 academic year and that all students will have
access to HyFlex teaching events where pedagogically appropriate, from the commencement of
the 2026/27 academic year. The first 30 of our classrooms have now been converted for Hyflex
use and in tandem with the physical room installation work, the Digital Education team have
been working with colleagues to undertake the necessary staff development and curriculum
enhancement work required to support the delivery of HyFlex teaching and an expanded Hyflex
portfolio in 2024/25. Staff and student feedback from the 2023/24 pilot programme was very
positive. The initiative is being well received with flexibility, convenience and accessibility
highlighted as the main advantages from the student perspective.
Following the completion of the technology research phase the estates building and enabling
works for the Immersive Learning Centre have been completed and procurement is underway for
the IT and audio-visual equipment. The Centre will comprise four main facilities
• The Immersive Learning Classroom will cater for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented
Reality (AR) experiences primarily for class groups;
• The Immersive Learning Studio will provide space for the creation of VR/AR content
using technologies like motion capture, 3D scanning, immersive audio recordings and
conventional recordings using cameras and audio that are then integrated into
experiences using the other technologies;
• The Immersive Learning PC Lab will house high-spec PCs for teaching VR/AR, developing
VR/AR resources and other digital media development skills such as video editing;
• In conjunction with the Library, an Immersive Learning Loan Service will allow staff and
students to borrow VR headsets, 360 degree cameras, digital recorders and other
production equipment. This will enable all students to independently explore a range of
VR/AR opportunities and provide resources for staff and students to produce immersive
media, create learning materials, undertake research and complete coursework.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The student experience
Our institutional restructuring has enabled us to provide more focus and resource in support of
the student experience. We have developed a new Student Learning Development Strategy to
provide a clear road map for our work to enhance all aspects of the student journey.
From the 2023/24 academic year we have created Faculty-level Head of Education posts as well
as school-level undergraduate and taught postgraduate leads. We have taken the opportunity to
enhance and clarify the roles and responsibilities for programme and module leads. We have
created new professional service posts aimed specifically at tracking and intervention in relation
to student engagement, and this work is further supported by the online student engagement
system being developed as part of our Student Success Project. We are continuing to review the
balance of our services between online and face-to-face delivery and looking at how we can
provide more services on site at times that will be most helpful to students.
We have integrated all academic development and study skills staff into one cross-institutional
team led by an experienced member of staff. In addition to academic support, we have worked
on the comprehensive student support provided via the student services team. This includes
orientation and induction, student advice services, financial support, student wellbeing services,
support for students with disabilities, mental health services, and careers & enterprise support.
We have invested in our capacity and expertise to support work on Student Voice and other
feedback and survey activity. This backs our aim to develop and improve our university-wide
approach to student voice and improving the student experience in response to student
feedback. The immediate priorities have been to: develop guidance and information to raise
awareness and student engagement of student feedback opportunities; establish monitoring
processes that track actions in response to student feedback and close the feedback loop; forge
stronger ties with student groups and the Birkbeck Students’ Union; to bring the student voice
into university projects, initiatives and monitoring; embed student feedback metrics, actions and
responses into Annual Quality and Enhancement processes; enhance student voice data literacy
and visualisations to expand the data-led culture at Birkbeck.
We have put in place more support and development for our teaching colleagues. Last year, we
introduced a new Birkbeck fellowship pathway, focussing on early career staff. Fortnightly
workshops over two terms are facilitated by Birkbeck academics, external consultants and
experienced experts in their field. At the end of the programme participants are supported in
writing and submitting an application for the appropriate level of Advance HE fellowship.
Looking forward
We are continuing to focus on the following immediate priorities:
Daytime teaching. Building on the initial rollout of programmes in 2024/25, we will continue to
expand our daytime teaching portfolio in areas of high potential demand. We are offering
students the choice between an afternoon and an evening offer, with study organised around
two- or three-days of campus attendance a week. As with evening teaching sessions, day-time
study will be supported with rich online learning resources.
Market analysis indicates that this model should appeal to younger commuter students in
Greater London and its immediate hinterland combining study with other commitments and our
location and reputation will enable us to better compete and meet this demand.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Building our international market. We will continue to develop our existing relationship with the
UK-based Cambridge Education Group. We will identify and pursue opportunities emerging
through our relationships with education service providers to support collaboration with Chinese
Universities, pursue institutional articulation arrangements in India and Sri Lanka, and through
opportunities with US institutions to boost humanities and social science student recruitment at
the post-graduate level. Our increasing suite of daytime programmes will make our offer more
attractive to international markets and we are now focussing effort on improving our position in
international league tables such as the QS rankings to improve our overall competitive profile.
We have a strong story to tell here but need to devote time to presenting our strengths and
international reach more systematically and consistently.
New programmes. We will be launching new programmes across the University in 2025 bringing
together academic creativity with market research and capitalising on the breadth of our
academic subjects and the clear synergy between them, particularly in areas such as artificial
intelligence and the environment.
HyFlex. We will continue the major investment in the infrastructure and facilities that will enable
us to reach new students through HyFlex delivery with teaching simultaneously taking place on
campus and online. This innovation means that in our areas of major academic and research
strength we will be able to open our teaching portfolio at distance across the UK, as well as to
those able to attend classes in central London.
Developing, rethinking and resizing our estate
We have committed to the transformation of our estate to create a connected campus clearly
focussed on our main Torrington Square site, rationalising our other estate holdings to create the
foundation for a future estate that can be sustainable, both environmentally and financially.
Linked to our education strategy we have achieved our aim of all Birkbeck classes being
delivered in Birkbeck classrooms, recognising that to deliver the learning experience we want we
need to have tight integration between our physical estate and our digital infrastructure including
direct control over both.
Our aim through development, investment and the co-location of facilities and services is to
create a campus environment that supports a transformational student experience alongside
modern facilities that underpin the excellence of our research. We will do that by focussing on
the development and refurbishment of the adjacent buildings that now run the full length of
Torrington Square to the West: Birkbeck Central, the Torrington Square Main Building, and, in the
longer-term, the redevelopment of the Main Building extension.
We will retain our existing buildings around Torrington Square to the East – the Wohl Wolfson
Toddler Lab, the Clore Management Centre, and the Henry Wellcome Building - to support our
connected campus, creating a clear Birkbeck presence and identity around the Square.
In this context we have progressed the identification of options for the location of our teaching,
our staff and our key infrastructure and facilities. This is now allowing us to pursue various
opportunities for estate asset sales that support both our overall financial position and provide
long-term capacity for strategic investment.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
We have continued with our planning for the progressive development of Birkbeck Central as the
focus for investment in the student experience. Our Estates and IT Teams have worked in close
collaboration on the implementation of our HyFlex teaching project. This year we have earmarked
over £2.0 million of capital funding to student experience focussed projects including the
development of a brand-new Student Wellbeing Lounge on the ground floor of the Birkbeck
Central building. This front facing facility will provide flexible multipurpose spaces opening the
ground floor and bringing currently unusable space into use. The space will be our largest
student space outside of the library benefitting our current student body and responding directly
to the feedback received as part of our consultation with students. It recognises that our current
and future students need to work, collaborate and interact in new ways. In a related project we
are also refurbishing our existing Student Centre at the entrance to our main Torrington Square
building, again with similar objectives.
To support our major organisational change, we have created more dedicated space that
supports agile, hybrid working, bringing the professional services teams in our new Faculties
together to enable more collaborative working in modern flexible and highly efficient workspaces.
In pursuit of the connected campus agenda, we have identified and implemented opportunities
to improve the public realm environment surrounding our estate and the overall visual identity
and wayfinding. We have been successful in securing external funding to support our
environmental and sustainability agenda and this will give further impetus to our work on heat
decarbonisation.
Alumni and friends of the University
The 2023/24 financial year marked the culmination of our activity around Birkbeck’s 200th
anniversary and ‘The World Needs More Birkbeck’ campaign. The highlight of this programme
was the 200th Foundation Day Dinner at Mansion House hosted by HRH the Princess Royal, The
Lord Mayor Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli and outgoing Vice-Chancellor Professor David
Latchman. This was attended by 200 members of the Birkbeck community.
The generosity of alumni, friends, corporate partners, trusts and foundations allows the
University to continue to support our student community and to advance our world leading
research. Donations supporting a range of strategic priorities have been offered including:
• Widening access to education and supporting our students: including scholarships,
bursaries, hardship support and developing our employability and wellbeing offer;
• Capital projects, facilities and equipment: including technology such as Hyflex, VR and AR
to enhance our teaching and learning;
• Academic research: including academic posts, PhD studentships and seed funding for
new areas of research.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
In the year to 31 July 2024, £2,033,660 of new philanthropic income was committed to Birkbeck
by over a thousand donors, from alumni pledging regular monthly gifts to multiple five and six
figure pledges from individuals, charitable trusts and corporate organisations. The following chart
demonstrates the breadth of philanthropic support.
ph&fax
In addition to supporting the University financially our community of alumni and friends adds
significant value through volunteering as keynote speakers, guest lecturers, mentors, panellists
and ambassadors and giving strategic advice and insight through focus groups and advisory
boards. In 2023/24 our community volunteered more than 5,600 hours to help Birkbeck staff
and students, with 225 individuals volunteering for the first time.
We continue to deliver a comprehensive programme of communication and events to build our
global alumni community. Highlights this year were thought leadership lectures by Sir Kenneth
Olisa, Nilufer von Bismarck OBE and Stephen Cooper CBE.
Birkbeck is now looking to build upon the success of our 200th anniversary year to create a step
change in alumni engagement and grow philanthropic income generation. A new Director of
Development and Alumni, Abbie Carr, has been appointed and took up post in May alongside
other new appointments in the team.
Gender pay gap
Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to
operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which
rewards staff in line with the University commitment to equality and diversity. The Gender Pay
Gap report is produced each year as part of our ongoing commitment to monitor gender equality
and diversity pay issues in our workforce. We have been publishing equal pay audits since 2009
and continue this practice in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010
(Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on certain
metrics annually.

In addition to the mandatory annual Gender Pay Gap report, Birkbeck also undertakes a full pay
audit periodically (most recently April 2022) to provide analysis and recommendations in relation
to reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the institution. This
report considers the pay of staff with other protected characteristics such as race and disability
and sets out a series of actions to address pay gap issues.

Birkbeck, University of London
Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Birkbeck operates several contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different
conditions required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to
demonstrate excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal
circumstances, and all committee members undertake both formal Equality & Diversity and
unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is reviewed annually by Birkbeck for equality &
diversity issues in application and success rates.
The divergence from the mean to the median is linked to one payment which recognises a
significant change in effort and contribution in one particular year.
The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
favour of men on average in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal pay for work
of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the population
distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted actions from
previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena Swan, have been
identified and put in place to address population imbalances.
Although the vertical gender pay gap remains 2023 saw another small shift towards greater
gender equality. In fact, 50.8% of the top quartile in 2023 were female, a reversal of the gap
seen in previous years. Our position is now significantly better than the sector average as can be
seen in the following graphic.
Note: Quartile pay refers to the hourly pay for all full-pay relevant employees in the relevant pay period. Full-pay relevant
employees are ordered from highest to lowest based on their hourly pay and the list is divided into four quarters with an equal
number of employees in each section.
Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2023
to 31 March 2024
The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility time is the
provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
and transparent monitoring of this.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Financial Review
The Financial Statements presented to the Governors comprise the results of the University. The
principal activities undertaken by the University are teaching and research together with ancillary
activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional activities include rendering academic services to
a variety of educational, commercial and other organisations. The University does not have any
subsidiaries so has no need to prepare Group accounts.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of
Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and,
therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The Financial
Statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the
revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
The completion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, global recovery from the
effects of the pandemic, geopolitical events and increases in inflation have had a significant
effect on families, businesses, and economies in the last few years. Despite a swift and
successful move to on-line learning during lockdown student numbers fell significantly in
2021/22 and have not recovered since. This has led to direct and indirect financial
consequences for the University and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.
Although we need to rapidly address a financial position where costs exceed income we are not
alone in the UK HE sector. Government regulated tuition fees for Home undergraduate students
remain fixed at £9,250 with the Vice Chancellor of KCL noting in September 2024 at the
Universities UK annual conference that a fee of between £12,000 to £13,000 more accurately
represents the fee required to match inflation since 2015/16. The erosion in value of the fee
that can be charged is placing considerable strain on the budgets of all universities in England.
Whilst the announcement of an inflationary increase in the home undergraduate fee from
2025/26 is welcomed this is more than offset by the reduction in the maximum fee we can
charge for non-STEM foundation year students and the impact of the National Insurance
increase. This Financial Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial
impact of pension and other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive
Income & Expenditure and Statement of Financial Position.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The recurrent teaching grant from the government continues to fall and fell by a further £0.2
million in 2023/24. Teaching grant now represents only 2.1% of total income in comparison with
47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from tuition fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to
61.1% in 2022/23. Tuition income fell by £5.2 million this year to £63.4 million, down from a
peak of £79.5 million in 2020/21. 2020/21 saw a spike in applications from EU students
wishing to benefit from the final year of UK government tuition fee loans and this increase was
replaced by a significant reduction the following year as EU students had to pay their own fees –
an outcome seen across the sector not just at Birkbeck. Falls in new undergraduate student
numbers have a knock-on effect on future years as larger graduating cohorts of undergraduates
are replaced by lower incoming groups of students. Table 3 highlights the cohort effect of lower
incoming groups of undergraduates on the number of continuers from the new student peak in
2020/21.

Continuing undergraduates 2,862 3,088 3,215 2,857 2,515
Table 3: Cohort effect of falling undergraduate recruitment
Recurrent grant from Research England fell by £1.4 million (11.4%) primarily due to non-
recurrent grant funding received in 2022/23 to help offset the negative impact of not being
associated with Horizon Europe. We are pleased that UK universities are once again able to
collaborate with partners under the programme. Externally funded research activity fell by £1.7
million (18.0%) in part due to the impact on grant capture from having fewer research active staff
– a consequence of the need to reduce staff costs in recent years. This fall in grant income is
offset by a similar reduction in expenditure.
The University primarily provides teaching to its students in the evening and rents much of its
space to other universities during the daytime. Income from lettings, catering and conferences
fell by £0.1 million in 2023/24 but still represents 4.7% of total income (2022/23: 4.5%). Given
our size we have been very successful in generating philanthropic income receiving £2.7 million
in donations and endowments compared with £2.3 million the previous year.
Governors agreed the current investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support our core
business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our estates
strategy. £10.0 million was invested in two externally managed funds with strong Environmental,
Social and Governance criteria embedded in investment decision making. Both funds performed
remarkably well and in November 2021 combined gains of £4.0 million were realised and
converted into cash with both funds reset to £10.0 million. After a fall in equity values and
dividend income in 2022/23 investment income grew by £0.5 million (an increase of 41.0%) this
year with an unrealised gain in investments of £1.4 million (2022/23: unrealised loss of £0.3
million) being recorded.

The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since the government increased the
maximum fee which universities could charge to Home undergraduates to £9,000 in 2012
appeared to have plateaued but further falls have now been experienced in the last three years.
We are pleased that the Lifelong Learning Entitlement is scheduled to be introduced from 2027
albeit that the start has been delayed by a year following the autumn 2024 budget. We are
generally supportive of measures aimed at relaxing the apprenticeship levy criteria thereby
enabling businesses to support a wider range of skills training through part-time and short
courses. It is clear that re-skilling and up-skilling of the UK workforce in key areas is a core part of
both national and local government strategies and we will be developing new programmes and
modes of delivery to further support the ambitions of part-time students.
Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this
occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown
restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters
programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to
upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-
Brexit) recovery.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
This increase was reversed in 2021/22 in part due to positive employment rates in London and
the cost pressures of high inflation. Numbers have reduced further each year with the total
number of Home Masters students studying in 2023/24 standing 25.8% below the number in
2021/22 at 1,406 FTE.
International recruitment has fallen significantly across the sector at postgraduate level following
the removal of the student dependents’ visa. Although the change came into effect in January
2024, enrolment in October 2023 was adversely affected. 697 new international students
commenced a Masters programme with us in 2022/23 compared with only 509 a year later - a
fall of 27.0%. International undergraduates have not been able to bring dependents to the UK
whilst they study so the visa change had limited impact other than to re-enforce perceptions of
negative sentiment towards international students. Although Birkbeck recruits significantly lower
numbers of undergraduates internationally in comparison with postgraduates, the year-on-year
fall in new starts was similar.
Falls in new student enrolments coupled with the cohort effect of recruiting lower numbers of
undergraduates has inevitably had an impact on total tuition income, despite Home postgraduate
and international fees being increased in line with inflation each year. Table 4 summarises the
change in income over the last four years since the peak in 2020/21.

Table 4: Change in tuition income over last four years
We have seen an upward trend in the number of students looking to complete a foundation year
before progressing on to year one of a degree since we introduced the programme in 2018.
Students studying for a degree with a foundation year represented 14.8% of our student body In
2023/24, Many of our students return to study later in life and often did not achieve A-levels or
equivalent whilst at school. We were extremely disappointed when the Government announced
that from 2025/26 the maximum fee allowable for non-STEM foundation year provision would be
£5,760 rather than £9,250. We believe that the foundation year is critical from an equality
perspective and remain committed to delivering the programmes. This fee reduction largely
erodes the positive financial impact of the recently announced inflationary increase in the
maximum fee we are able to charge undergraduate Home students and will prolong our ability to
invest in all the services we wish to provide. This financial challenge is being faced by all
universities and is unsustainable for a sector which is fundamental to the success of the UK and
its economy.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
A significant proportion of our budget is focussed on academic and related services - 2023/24:
63.8% of total expenditure compared with 58.0% in 2018/19. Over the same time period
administrative and professional costs have remained at the same level (now representing 19.1%
of expenditure) and premises costs have been reduced by £3.3 million (a fall from 12.9% of total
expenditure in 2018/19 to 10.6% in 2023/24). With falling income and increasing costs,
particularly due to recent historic high levels of inflation, we have had no choice but to reduce our
cost base. Despite this imperative, we have maintained a focus on resourcing academic and
academic support areas.
The ratio of staff costs to total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and
restructuring costs) is a helpful metric to review when considering financial sustainability. In
general, restructuring costs should be included in this metric but are excluded from Table 5
allowing for better year-on-year comparison. The University does not own any student residences
(which increase income without a corresponding material increase in staff costs) so this
percentage remains one of the highest in the sector.

Table 5: Change in underlying staff costs as a percentage of income 2018/19 to 2023/24
Tuition fees and education contracts provided 64.3% of total income in 2023/24 (the same as
the previous year) whilst staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) represent
67.6% of total income (2022/23: 68.4%). With Home undergraduate fees fixed by the UK
government the annual increases in staff costs through promotions, incremental drift and pay
award create a mismatch between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff
costs. The underlying pressure is currently exacerbated by historically high inflation increasing
costs.
Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs
and the University delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit referendum fall in students enrolling
from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 8
and directly led to the underlying deficit in 2018/19. We saw a significant switch back in
2020/21 due to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition income and a surplus was delivered.
Unfortunately, the fall in new student enrolments since coupled with high inflation has moved us
into a position of worsening underlying deficit.

Staff costs and tuition income 2014/15 to
2023/24
Chart 8: Staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) and tuition income 2014/15 to 2023/24
Chart 8 graphically illustrates the financial challenge the University faces: with a heavy reliance
on tuition income, and an inability to increase the Home undergraduate fee above the cap set by
the government, the University must increase student numbers each year to offset cost inflation.
Following the recent falls in student numbers and income we had no choice but to make difficult
choices and reduce our staff establishment. Taking a phased approach over two years, staff
costs have been reduced by over £11.0 million through a combination of voluntary severance,
early retirement and vacancy management (albeit that inflation and other increases have partly
eroded the underlying saving).
Unlike a number of universities, we continue to apply the sector pay award in full when it is
announced. We also remain committed to paying the London Living Wage from the first day of
the month following the announcement of any increase.
The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2020 with the effect
that the scheme deficit increased. Employee benefits were reduced and a repayment plan was
agreed in 2021/22. This deficit recovery plan increased our share of the pension liability by
£20.3 million with a corresponding reduction to the comprehensive income for the year. The
2023 valuation, however, determined that the scheme was in a far stronger position with asset
values exceeding the estimate for future liabilities. This change from a significant deficit to a
surplus was primarily down to the impact of increased inflation rates on the way the scheme is
valued. This improvement paved the way for significant reductions in contribution rates for both
employers and employees and a reversal of the benefit changes introduced the previous year.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
As can be seen from Table 5, current rates are now at historic lows. The employer contribution
rates over this period have included deficit recovery contributions which were levied to help
reduce the size of the deficit over time. The most recent rate (payable from April 2022) was 6.2%
of salaries. The move to a surplus of course no longer requires these contributions to be made
but the employers agreed to reinvest some of the savings to fund additional stability measures
which should limit volatility over the next few years.
Contribution rates 2011 - Apr 16 - Apr 19 - Oct 19 - Oct 21 - Apr 22 - Jan 24

Employers 16.0% 18.0% 19.5% 21.1% 21.4% 21.6% 14.5%
Table 5: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
The fluctuating economic assumptions underpinning the annual assessment of the value of the
scheme assets and future liabilities by USS has seen the University’s share of the deficit undergo
material changes over the last few years as seen in Table 6. The move to a scheme surplus
means we no longer need to carry a liability against future costs in our Balance Sheet with a net
reduction in costs in the 2024 Statement of Comprehensive Income & Expenditure of £29.0
million.

Table 6: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
Governors have long been concerned about the risk the scheme places on the financial health of
the University and the periodic uncertainty that the valuations introduce. They are also mindful of
the fact that around 20% of eligible staff nationally have chosen not to be members of USS with
many citing that the contribution rates are unaffordable. The number of members at Birkbeck
rose by around 3.5% following the positive outcome of the 2023 valuation and we remain
supportive of plans to develop alternate, flexible pension options for staff within USS.
Non-staff cost budgets were reduced in the autumn of 2023 when we realised that student
income would not hit target and budget managers adapted and carefully monitored their spend
plans identifying further savings throughout the year. Tight budgetary control allowed us to save
around £1.7 million against the revised staff budget through careful management of vacancies.
This approach provided both in-year and permanent savings whilst also recycling budget to
priority areas. Similar non-staff savings of £1.5 million were achieved from delaying or reducing
planned activities.
The provision for doubtful debts provides an assessment at the end of each year as to the
proportion of student related debt which may be unlikely to be recovered. The provision
increased by £1.0 million in 2022/23 almost certainly as a consequence of the challenge many
of our students are facing as inflation and interest rates have risen significantly. Some countries
such as Nigeria also saw material currency changes effectively increase the cost of their study
abroad. Interestingly, applying the same methodology at 31 July 2024 estimated the provision to
be £1.3 million lower at a level more akin to historic levels. This change resulted in a positive
budget variance of £0.7 million.

Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Total income has been impacted over recent years by Brexit and the Covid pandemic with
international students also having to contend with adverse currency fluctuations and the removal
of the student dependent visas. Despite a very strong start to the 2023/24 recruitment cycle
with more offers being made to international students than ever before, confirmed acceptances
fell away dramatically over the late summer period and the annual growth achieved in 2022/23
disappeared entirely. National and global circumstances have adversely affected international
recruitment at all institutions again for 2024/25 and we have unfortunately been no exception.
Although international undergraduate numbers remained stable due to higher conversion against
lower numbers of applications our much larger number of postgraduates fell for the second year.
Chart 9 highlights the changes over the last five years (2024/25 data correct at 26 October
2024).

Chart 9: International postgraduate conversion 2021/22 to 2024/25
We still have an opportunity to recruit for a January 2025 start but this will only add around 60
additional students if we hit the same figure as January 2024 (which seems unlikely given the
October 2024 reduction).
A change in UK government and restrictions on international student recruitment in markets
such as Canada and Australia may make the UK a more attractive destination once again. We will
be looking to increase our undergraduate cohort and recover postgraduate numbers in 2025/26
as we roll out our new flexible afternoon/evening offer of study.
The downturn in international recruitment has also impacted on the Home market as the more
selective universities looked to offset the lost international income by recruiting more UK based
students. Anecdotal feedback indicates that a number of universities have seen significant falls
in undergraduate recruitment in 2024/25 but we achieved year on year growth. Our new Vice-
Chancellor identified the importance of undergraduate conversion when she started in January
2024 and Chart 10 highlights the impact of changes in marketing, conversion and general
processing effectiveness.

Part-time undergraduate offers and enrolments also improved after many years of decline with
enrolments increasing by 15.7% to 250 FTE in 2024/25. Home postgraduate offers and
enrolments were broadly flat.
Each year, staff costs increase due to the national pay award, incremental drift and promotions.
Whilst the fall in contributions to USS was welcome the fixed unit of resource from Home
undergraduate students requires student number growth simply to meet the inflationary increase
in staff costs. This challenge has increased due to the significant increase in employer National
Insurance which will be introduced in 2025. Not only do we need to tightly control costs in the
short term to manage the fall in student numbers but the challenge of managing rising costs with
a fixed annual income is a cycle we must break.
Having already restructured our staff base income growth is now the priority. Our focus will be on
growing Home undergraduate numbers and recovering international on campus coupled with the
development of both UK and international partnerships. A number of changes will improve the
success of our objectives:
• HyFlex teaching will allow time poor students with careers and other responsibilities the
option of studying either remotely or on-site. This should improve both recruitment and
retention;
• Flexible options across the afternoon and evening will allow students the choice of
studying when and where (with HyFlex) it suits their needs. The opportunity to study in the
afternoon rather than the evening may be particularly attractive to international students;
• A full recruitment cycle marketing both flexibility and HyFlex, coupled with improvements
in processing and conversion, should increase both offer and enrolment levels; and

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
• Using the considerable experience of our new Vice Chancellor to develop high quality
partnerships, both home and overseas, will generate additional income over time.
Although we posted an underlying deficit once again, we are optimistic that we will be able to
increase income over the next few years whilst also keeping costs down. We do not have any
loans so are not pressured by financial covenants during a period of recovery. Our Balance Sheet
has strengthened due to the removal of the pension liability to USS and we continue to invest in
Estates projects to improve the student experience. Total cash plus investments fell by £2.9
million but remains at a relatively healthy balance of £46.7 million at the year end. The cash
reserves provide a buffer which will allow us a period of time to turn the deficits around.
Reversing the gap between tuition income and staff costs (around £6.0 million in 2023/24)
remains the priority and income growth rather than further major restructures will return us to a
break-even position. A review of downside scenarios (including a no growth scenario) indicates
that the University remains a going concern.
Risk Management
An effective approach to risk management is seen by the University as an essential element of
corporate governance. We provided a full compliance statement on internal control last year and
will continue to do so.
The internal auditor undertook six reviews during 2023/24 in order to assist our Audit Committee
in reaching an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the institution’s arrangements for:
risk management; control & governance; financial sustainability, quality of data; economy,
efficiency & effectiveness (value for money). An assurance rating of “significant assurance with
minor improvement opportunities” was concluded for each with no high importance
recommendations being identified.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
The University Risk Management Policy explains the underlying approach to risk management
and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit Committee,
University management groups and other key parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk
management process and identifies the main reporting procedures. The University has reviewed
its approach to risk management to strengthen risk ownership and to improve Birkbeck’s ability
to identify and assess significant risks and respond to them quickly and effectively. It has been
making regular reports on this to Audit Committee.
The top-level Risk Register is compiled by senior management and overseen by a Risk
Management Group comprising the principal risk owners. Each risk owner is responsible for a
risk register for their risk area in which current and potential future risks are identified and
evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. Governance and oversight for
each risk area is provided by the relevant University committee or management group. The risks
are monitored by Audit Committee and Governors.
Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
(highest impact and likelihood) is 25.
The top risks are reduced student income leading to a position where costs exceed income. The
financial risk escalated due to lower student numbers in recent years coupled with inflation at an
historic high level in 2023. The underlying risk factors plus the actions taken and to be taken to
mitigate the risks have been discussed in this Strategic Review. Although the University is
forecasting underlying financial deficits for the next few years as it looks to recover student
numbers, we have modelled the impact of not achieving or partially achieving our plans.
Downside stress testing indicates that we will remain solvent however liquidity will need to be
managed closely. Monthly cash flow reports and management accounts are prepared and
reviewed by management to help identify emerging risks at the earliest opportunity.
Our Estates and IT teams have developed detailed risk registers for their areas of responsibility
which have been reviewed termly by the Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committee and Digital
Committee respectively. IT have worked on improving staff understanding of good password
management whilst also enhancing the security and monitoring of software and infrastructure.
Our Estates team is currently developing plans to ensure we meet our obligations under
“Martyn’s Law” recently approved by Parliament to increase preparedness for, and protection
from, terrorist attacks at public venues. Cybersecurity is likely to remain a significant risk
indefinitely due to the adaptability of those looking to breach security arrangements.
Recognising that organisational change and delivery of recovery plans are themselves a risk, in
mitigation we increased the range and frequency of project and management oversight groups.
The Vice-Chancellor now chairs fortnightly meetings of the University Executive Board (UEB) which
includes the DVCs, PVCs, Executive Deans and key Professional Service Directors. The Vice
Chancellor also holds weekly, informal, meetings of her senior leadership team. Following the
academic restructure that was effective from 1 August 2023, the Vice Chancellor also chairs a
termly meeting of a wider group of senior managers which includes all members of UEB plus
Heads of School, Faculty Heads of Teaching and Research and professional services Directors
who do not attend UEB. These meetings aim to ensure that priority recovery initiatives as well as
general compliance and business activity progress as expected. A range of sub-committees
support the work of the University including identification and mitigation of risks.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Public Benefit Statement
The University Charter updated 25 May 2023 states:
“The objects of Birkbeck shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons who
are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in
subjects determined by the Governors, advised by the Academic Board.”
As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Governing Body has
regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in
the following manner.
The advancement of education
The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.
The Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins everything
we do.
In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
the Charities Act. The following table summarises our research income over the last four years:
2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24

Table 8: Research income trends
Income from research grants and contracts is released in line with progress on the projects. A
new Deputy Vice Chancellor for Research, Knowledge Exchange & Innovation will be appointed in
2024/25 to implement plans to take us forward to REF 2029. In addition to maintaining our REF
standing for breadth of quality across the institution the new role holder will focus on increasing
both the income generated from external research grants and the contribution towards
overheads.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Whilst our core mission underpins the advancement of education this in turn can have a
profound impact on wider public benefits.
The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
(prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
describes our more widespread support for students with a diverse range of characteristics.
The University predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to
educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who
may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for
mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through
our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution
and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented
groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without
strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily
increasing to 981 FTE in 2023/24 (2022/23: 985 FTE) (see Chart 6). During 2023/24 42% of
our students are from ethnic minority backgrounds (2022:23: 41%), 43% male (2022/23: 42%),
25% declaring a disability (2022/23: 25%) and 62% over the age of 25 (2022/23: 64%). We are
proud to offer an opportunity to groups of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and
remain committed to driving this agenda in the higher education sector.
Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from
ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 97%
of our part-time students (2022/23: 97%) and 70% of full-time students (2022/23: 73%) are
over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who wish to combine evening university teaching
with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be
able to study. Over recent years we have seen a steady increase in the number of full-time
undergraduates aged 21 or under choosing to study at the University suggesting the ability to mix
education and work is increasingly attractive to younger students.
The opportunity for non-traditional students with careers and other responsibilities is being
enhanced through both the introduction of HyFlex teaching and teaching in the afternoon. In
future, students will be able to study in a mode and at a time that suits their needs recognising
that changes in working patterns post-Covid have been significant. The flexibility to study when
and where is convenient for the student (rather than our staff) may also open opportunity based
on student location given the fact that students will no longer be required to attend all their
lectures on site in Bloomsbury.
In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that
government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes
for mature students, including part-time study. Our own strategic shift to more flexible delivery
also appears to have improved part-time recruitment in 2024/25 after many years of decline.
Despite the challenges faced by the part-time sector our outcomes regarding access to higher
education continue to be strong and demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working
with non-traditional students. We plan to continue with our current approach on access.

STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)
Many of our students work during the day and have families. These critical life factors inevitably
challenge our students and this is reflected in our continuation rates. Through the pandemic, the
move to on-line was welcomed as it enabled our students to study when time allowed. To ensure
that working students with other life priorities can continue to engage with higher education and
succeed moving all our programmes towards HyFlex delivery will not only provide increased
opportunity but also improve retention and outcomes. This change in pedagogy will be facilitated
by upgrades to the AV and IT of all classrooms across our estate. This £8.0 million project is
supported by £3.0 million of capital funding from the Office for Students.
Detailed information on the ways that we provide support to our students can be found in the
University Access and Participation Plan. Further details are provided in Note 9 to the Financial
Statements.

remuneration, benefits and conditions of employment of the staff of the University. It considers
the remuneration, benefits and conditions of employment of the University’s senior team and the
remuneration, benefits and conditions of employment of other members of staff with senior
management roles on salaries of more than £100,000 (full time equivalent), making an annual
report to Governors. The Committee’s terms of reference are compliant with the CUC’s
Remuneration Code. The Committee’s membership is wholly independent and does not include
any University staff.
University Executive Board
University Executive Board (UEB) is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor and consists of officers of the
University with strategic management responsibility. It is responsible for the effective and
successful management and operation of Birkbeck and for advising Governors on University-wide
strategic issues and priorities. It oversees the annual planning and budgeting process and

Policy Committee, Equality and Diversity Committee, Health and Safety Committee, Student
Recruitment Committee, Ethics Committee and Risk Management Group all report to UEB.
Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee
Under the Statutes, Governors have oversight and responsibility for all the activities of the
University but must consider the advice of the Academic Board on all academic matters.
Academic Board is responsible to the governing body for the academic work of the University and
reports termly on the business it has considered. The Academic Board is chaired by the Vice-
Chancellor and has a membership of more than 200 drawn from academic and Library staff and
the students of the College. To increase the effectiveness of its decision making, it has
established the Academic Board Executive Committee (ABExCo) as its steering committee.
ABExCo is also chaired by the Vice-Chancellor and its members include the Deputy and Pro Vice-
Chancellors, the Executive Deans of the Faculties and the academic staff and student governors,
all of whom are also members of the full Academic Board.
The membership of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 5-8.
Statement of internal control
The governing body is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control that
supports the achievement of Birkbeck’s strategies, policies, aims and objectives whilst
safeguarding the public and external funds for which it is responsible. It undertakes these
obligations in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to the governing body in the
University Charter and Statutes and the public interest governance principles set out in the
regulatory framework for Higher Education in England.
The system of internal control includes arrangements for the prevention and detection of
corruption, fraud, bribery and other irregularities. It is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to fulfil strategies, policies, aims and objectives and safeguard public funds,
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness.

Birkbeck, University of London
Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)
The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify the principal
risks, evaluate the nature and extent of those risks and manage them efficiently, effectively and
economically. The process is regularly reviewed by Governors and accords with the principles in
the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.
Birkbeck manages risks through a Risk Register, reviewed by the Risk Management Group, UEB
and the Audit Committee reporting to Governors. The University’s Risk Management Policy is
reviewed annually by the Risk Management Group and Audit Committee reporting to Governors.
The following processes have been established:
• the performance and strategic direction of Birkbeck is reviewed annually by UEB and the
Governors;
• Governors agree and annually review Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic
objectives and risks;
• Governors receive termly and annual reports from the Audit Committee concerning
internal control and risk management;
• Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Internal Auditor, which include an
independent opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of Birkbeck’s system of internal
control, together with recommendations for improvement. Audit Committee may also
request additional reports to gain assurance from other parties on areas of concern;
• a risk prioritisation methodology based on assessment of likelihood and impact has been
established. The Risk Register covers corporate level risks, including ability to fulfil
Birkbeck’s aims and objectives and ability to continue to comply with its conditions of
registration with the Office for Students;
• Audit Committee receives regular reports from University management on action taken to
mitigate the risks and the impact of that action and on changes to the risk profile
including new risks;
• Ethics Committee provides assurance on ethical matters related to research activities;
• there are comprehensive Financial Regulations, detailing financial controls and
procedures, approved by Governors on the advice of the Audit Committee and Finance &
General Purposes Committee;
• the governing body has compared Birkbeck’s governance system with the CUC’s HE Code
of Governance and concluded that the University is compliant with the principles of the
Code. Governors have asked Audit Committee to keep under review processes and
practices in line with the provisions of the Code;
• Governors commissioned an independent review of effectiveness in 2021. The review
report confirmed that the governing body is effective and compliant with OfS and CUC
expectations;

• the diversity of the governing body has increased following the appointment of new
independent governors through an open call for expressions of interest. The Review of
Governance Effectiveness asked Governors to consider the definition and meaning of
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion for Birkbeck. An Equality Diversity and Inclusion
Committee with a refreshed remit has been set up with UEB as its parent committee;
• institution level collaborations are overseen by the Collaborations Approval Panel;
• Governors review annually their Statement of Primary Responsibilities which covers
responsibilities reserved to Governors and responsibilities delegated to committees or to
the Vice-Chancellor.
There have been no significant internal control weaknesses or failures during this reporting
period. This statement is based on the information provided to Governors in the regular reports
on internal audit and risk management.
Governors have appointed a professional independent Internal Audit Service whose annual
programme is approved by the Audit Committee. The internal audit function provides, by
undertaking review, independent objective assurance to the governing body, through the Audit
Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the design and
effectiveness of the operation of internal controls that are intended to control critical business
application risks. Internal audit also helps the University accomplish its objectives by bringing a
systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk
management, control and governance processes and, by working with management, adding
value through advice and guidance.
The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the University’s risk profile. Internal audit
monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the
Audit Committee.
Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:
• the financial statements of the University give a true and fair picture of the state of its
affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cash flows for the
financial year;
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting
standards including the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction;
• external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those
purposes and managed appropriately; and
• income has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions from both the
Office for Students and Research England.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion, the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the University’s affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of
the University’s income and expenditure, gains and losses, changes in reserves and the
University’s cash flows for the year then ended; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice.
We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the University”) for
the year ended 31 July 2024 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income and
Expenditure, Statement of Changes in Reserves, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of
Cash Flows, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the University in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Board of Governors’ use of the
going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating
to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the
University’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from
when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Board of Governors with respect to going
concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The Board of Governors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there
is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters required by the Office for Students (“OfS”) and UK Research and
Innovation (including Research England)
In our opinion, in all material respects:
• funds from whatever source administered by the [University] for specific purposes have
been properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with relevant
legislation;
• funds provided by the OfS, UK Research and Innovation (including Research England),
the Education and Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Education have been
applied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions;
• the requirements of the OfS’s Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) have been met.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the OfS requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• The University’s grant and fee income, as disclosed in notes 1-3 to the accounts, has
been materially misstated.
• The University’s expenditure on access and participation activities for the financial year,
as has been disclosed in note 9a to the accounts, has been materially misstated.
Responsibilities of Governors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Corporate Governance and Internal Control, the
Board of Governors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Board of
Governors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Governors are responsible for assessing the
University’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Governors either
intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do
so.

Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures
are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
Non-compliance with laws and regulations
Based on:
• our understanding of the University and the sector in which it operates;
• discussion with management and those charged with governance, including the Audit
Committee;
• obtaining and understanding of the University’s policies and procedures regarding
compliance with laws and regulations;
• direct representation from the Accountable Officer; and
• our risk assessment
we considered the significant laws and regulations to be the Financial Reporting Standard 102,
the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further Education and Higher
Education (FEHE SORP 2019), the OfS’ Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) and UK tax legislation.
The University is also subject to laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance
could have a material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, for
example through the imposition of fines or litigations. We identified such laws and regulations to
be registration with the Office for Students and their ongoing conditions of registration.
Our procedures in respect of the above included:
• review of minutes of meetings of those charged with governance for any instances of
non-compliance with laws and regulations;
• review of correspondence with regulatory and tax authorities for any instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations;
• review of financial statement disclosures and agreeing to supporting documentation; and
• review of legal expenditure accounts to understand the nature of expenditure incurred.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)
Fraud
We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including
fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:
• enquiry with management and those charged with governance, the Audit Committee and
internal audit regarding any known or suspected instances of fraud;
• obtaining an understanding of the University’s policies and procedures relating to:
o Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and
o Internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud.
• review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any known or
suspected instances of fraud;
• discussion amongst the engagement team as to how and where fraud might occur in the
financial statements;
• performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that
may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;
• performing substantive procedures over management override and the completeness of
research and other income; and
considering performance targets and the related financial statement areas impacted by
these.
Based on our risk assessment, we considered the areas most susceptible to fraud to be posting
inappropriate journals to manipulate financial results and management bias in accounting
estimates.
Our procedures in respect of the above included:
• Testing a sample of journal entries throughout the year, which met a defined risk criteria,
by agreeing to supporting documentation;
• Assessing significant estimates made by management for bias, including going concern
assumptions; assumptions applied in calculation of pension scheme liabilities; bad debt
provision; impairment of tangible and intangible assets; useful economic lives of tangible
fixed assets.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all
engagement team members and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance
with laws and regulations throughout the audit.
Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is
higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate
concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are
inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance
with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on
the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Birkbeck, University of London
Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
Statement of Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 July 2024
1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
The University's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and
position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.
Going Concern
The impact of lower student income following Brexit, increased competition across London and external
factors impacting international recruitment, together with historic high rates of inflation, have significantly
impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases
and increment advancement) exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due
to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of
5% of income eroded but we now need to implement a recovery plan to move from a period of actual and
forecast deficits back into a sustainable financial position.
In order to overcome the difficult challenges we faced both prior to the pandemic and in the years since,
we developed a recovery strategy focussed initially on delivering staff cost savings followed by increased
income, primarily from regaining student numbers. The strategy aimed to improve financial sustainability
whilst also ensuring we could maintain research intensity, market position and teaching competitiveness.
Repositioning required a fundamental revision of our underlying operational and teaching delivery models.
To ensure that we could create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and support student success we
needed a greater degree of standardisation in our mode of teaching delivery.
With support of Governors we implemented a new academic structure at the start of the 2023/24
academic year supported by a reshaped range of professional support services. This restructure delivered
nearly £12 million of staff savings, a slimmer management structure which will allow us to take decisions
in a more agile manner and improved operational processes. Reducing our staff costs quickly provided
financial headroom to allow us to focus on delivering income recovery plans over the next few years.
Although we had aspirations to increase tuition income in 2024/25 external factors severely impacted
international student recruitment to the UK and we saw our home postgraduate numbers fall. Improved
conversion activity from offer to enrolment saw year on year growth in both full time and part time
undergraduate recruitment from both the UK and overseas. This outcome has not been achieved across
the sector and is a positive base on which we can build for the future.
We are introducing new programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate level over the coming years
whilst also simplifying and refreshing existing portfolio. With the support of a £3m grant from the Office for
Students we are upgrading all of our classrooms to provide students with the option of attending in person
or on-line with no reduction in the ability of the student to engage (our HyFlex mode). Building on a
successful pilot by our School of Law we are also developing proposals across subject areas which will
allow students the choice of afternoon or evening study and in many cases a mix of both. The increased
flexibility offered by the introduction of afternoon teaching and HyFlex should be attractive to commuter
students in London and the South East who are interested in study whilst working or caring.

================================================================================

Birkbeck, University of London
Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024
Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
for the year ended 31 July 2024
1. Basis of preparation
Going Concern (continued)
Our approved Estates Strategy determined that having purchased the building adjacent to our main
campus site we are in a position to dispose of estate assets that are less suited to our future needs. The
disposal of outlying, historic buildings will both secure a capital receipt whilst also supporting our strategy
to provide improved learning and teaching facilities for our staff and students focussed on our main
campus around Torrington Square.
Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income and effective
management of costs, including stress testing. Although the base-case scenario predicts underlying
deficits for the next few years as we build new programmes and deliver education via new, flexible modes
of delivery the forecasts indicate that sufficient, albeit reducing cash reserves will be maintained. Even
under a downside scenario where no income recovery is possible in 2025/26 we remain solvent and
have sufficient time to undertake further mitigating actions. Governors have reviewed the financial
forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and medium term recovery strategy and the
risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges resulting from the drop in student
numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the University will retain adequate resources to continue
in operation. As a consequence, we continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing
these annual financial statements.
2. Basis of consolidation
The financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union as the
University does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
3. Income recognition
Tuition fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the
Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.
Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is
shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not
deducted from income.
Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when
the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms of the contract has been
satisfied.
Investment income is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a receivable basis.
Grant funding
Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and UKRI research and research grants, are
recognised as income over the periods in which the University recognises the related costs for which the
grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as
deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more
than one year as appropriate.
Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
University is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received
in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors
and released to income as the conditions are met.

for the year ended 31 July 2024
3. Income recognition (continued)
Donations and endowments
Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income when
the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is utilised in
line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the University is entitled to the funds.
Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to the
terms applied to the individual endowment fund.
There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
a) restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective;
b) unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the University; and
c) restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested to
generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.
Capital grants
Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
were used to purchase/ construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the University has
satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
4. Accounting for retirement benefits
University staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
(USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
professionally qualified independent actuaries.
Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
of the University due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
contribution retirement benefit schemes.
A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
schemes.
Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.

4. Accounting for retirement benefits (continued)
Defined benefit plan (continued)
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
defined benefit plans, the University’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
the University. The University should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net
of plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to
determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the university is able to recover the surplus either
through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
5. Employment benefits
Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
expense in the year in which the employees render service to the University. Any unused benefits are
accrued and measured as the additional amount the University expects to pay as a result of the unused
entitlement.
6. Finance leases
Leases in which the University assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.
7. Service concession arrangements
Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
financial liability.
Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
arrangement.
8. Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.
9. Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for
the year.

10. Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
assets.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a building are
capitalised.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
benefits to the University. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.
The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
depreciated as follows:
Buildings: 40 to 100 years
Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years
Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years
Leasehold land: the life of the lease
Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation is charged until the asset is brought into use
Equipment
Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
equipment is capitalised.
Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
lives are as follows:
- Computer hardware: 3 years
- Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
- Other equipment: 3 to 5 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
Balance Sheet.
11. Heritage assets
Works of art and other valuable artefacts are capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. They are subsequently held at
carrying value. Heritage assets are not depreciated as their long economic life means that any
depreciation would not be material.
The most recent professional valuation of heritage assets was carried out in June 2022. The impairment
has been recognised in these financial accounts. See note 12 for further information.

12. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial
phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8
years.
Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for
capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then
such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes
available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the
useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.
13. Investments
Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at market value. Investments in
subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the University's accounts. Current asset investments
are held at fair value with movements recognised within total comprehensive income for the year.
14. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months
from placement and overdrafts.
15. Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:
a) the University has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
b) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
16. Taxation
The University is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore,
a charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the
University is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within
categories covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively
charitable purposes.
The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
cost.
17. Reserves
Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
which, through endowment to the University, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the
university must hold in perpetuity.
Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
therefore, the University is restricted in the use of these funds.

18. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Management considers that certain accounting estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, debtors,
fixed assets and provisions are its critical accounting estimates.
In preparing these financial statements the University has made the following judgements:
a) Pension provisions include key assumptions on discount rates, salary inflation and staff numbers in the
future. Where the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to one of the
pension schemes, this is recognised as a liability on the balance sheet. Provisions are based on
management's estimate of expected future salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing
rate of discount. Further details are set out in note 25.
b) The holiday pay provision is calculated using a sample of departments within the University.
c) A general provision for bad and doubtful debts is calculated using a formula based on the age of the
overdue debt. The formula is applied consistently each year but necessarily requires a degree of
estimation. A specific provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for individual debts where recovery is
believed to be uncertain and this requires an element of judgement.
19. Termination payments
Termination benefits are recognised as a liability and expense when the University has a constructive
obligation, such as a formal plan in place that is effectively communicated to affected employees. The
liability is measured at the value of payments expected to be made to employees under the termination
arrangements. See also accounting policy 15. Provisions.

Remuneration of the Vice Chancellor
The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been determined and reviewed through appropriate and robust
processes in terms of independence, objectivity, and assessment of individual and overall institutional
performance.
Remuneration Committee
The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been set and reviewed by Remuneration Committee, which is
comprised of independent Governors. The Committee includes the Chair of Governors, but in accordance
with good practice, discussion of the Vice-Chancellor’s remuneration is chaired by another independent
Governor. The Vice Chancellor is not a member of Remuneration Committee and does not attend or
participate in discussion of the Vice-Chancellor’s remuneration. Remuneration Committee is supported by
the College Secretary & Clerk to the Governors and, additionally, advice is provided, or commissioned, by the
Director of Human Resources.
Process
The panel reviews the remuneration of the Vice Chancellor annually in the light of the following
information:
 Sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other sources for a range of
relevant comparator institutions.
 The outcome of the Vice Chancellor’s annual appraisal conducted by the Chair of Governors. This is a
formal documented process in which annual objectives are set and performance against those objectives
are reviewed.
 The broader context provided by institutional performance information and institutional KPIs agreed by
Governors.
Outcomes
Professor Latchman last received an increase in base salary, over and above the level of the national pay
award, in 2012. He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. His historic salary reflects his contribution to
the leadership and development of the University over a 20 year period which has had transformational
impact over this time. His salary has not been subject to any increase in relation to the national pay award.
In 2022, in view of Birkbeck’s financial position, Professor Latchman requested that his salary be reduced by
£50,000 per annum until further notice. The Remuneration Committee agreed to this reduction which came
into effect on 1 December 2022.
Professor Wheeler has been appointed with a salary commensurate with the size of Birkbeck as an
organisation, based on sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other
sources for a range of relevant comparator institutions.

Governors
The Governors are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the University's operations
and the composition of the Board, being drawn from local public and private sector organisations,
transactions may take place with organisations in which a governor may have an interest. Such transactions
have been declared under note 24 Related Parties.
No Governors received any remuneration or waived payments from the group during the year (2022/23: Nil).
Governors who are employees of the University receive no additional remuneration for their services as
governors.

The University records and reports on its access and participation plan according to the requirements of the
Office for Students, divided into the following areas:
- access work to help students from under-represented groups to go into higher education;
- financial support for eligible students;
- work to support disabled students in their study; and
- research into and evaluation of our activities.
The total spend across these four areas was £1,985,000. This was over and above the target investment for
2023/24 of £1,850,000.
Work in 2023/24 has included progressing the projects outlined in the revised Access and Participation Plan
2022-25 as approved by the Office for Students in Autumn 2023. This includes ongoing work in student
engagement monitoring, and the Faculty Professional Services staff reorganisation delivered in autumn
2023 saw new Student Engagement Officers commence their work in each of the faculties. We appointed a
new Student Success Research and Evaluation Lead during the academic year to increase our capacity to
evaluate our work. The portfolio review completed during the Autumn Term 2022 was delivered, with new
structure programmes commencing from Autumn 2023.
The University’s internal Professional Services reorganisation included the Access and Engagement Team,
and these staff associated with taking forward the Access and Participation Plan are now part of the
Education Directorate and are leading on the next iteration of the University’s APP due for submission to the
OfS in October 2024. The Access and Engagement Team continued to deliver programmes through 2023/24
to support young people in further education and mature learner engagement during the period. Its spend is
below target due to the mid-year departure of the Director and another member of the team taking one term
of unpaid leave.
As noted in the 2022/23 financial statements, the University purposefully reduced its overall expenditure on
individual student bursaries, as agreed with the OfS. Expenditure in this in this area was above the target
investment for the year and the £67,000 overspend in this category was primarily in Student Hardship
Funds.
Investment to support disabled students increased significantly this year, with additional expenditure in
mental health services and study support. Research and Evaluation spend increased slightly with the
introduction in the summer term of the dedicated staff role mentioned above.

Pension provision
The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the
contractual obligation with the USS to fund deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. The
latest valuation of the USS pension scheme dated 2023 determined that the scheme was in surplus. As a
result, the provision of £29,044 brought forward at 1 August 2023 was released to the Income and
Expenditure during the year.
Key assumptions and further information is provided in note 25. See also note 7 in respect of significant one-
off pension costs.
Other provisions
During the year, the University undertook further restructuring under a voluntary severance scheme. A provision
has been recognised for amounts agreed before the year-end that are due to be paid after the year-end.

24 Related party transactions
All Governors and senior staff of the University are required to complete an annual statement detailing any
significant personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the
composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations)
it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of
staff may have an interest. All transactions involving related parties are conducted in accordance with the
university's financial regulations and procurement policies/procedures.
During the year, the University entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related
parties. Transactions entered into, and balances outstanding at 31 July 2024 are as follows:

The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students'
Union as the University does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of
£390,000 (2022/23: £365,000) was provided to the Union.
In 2018/19 a loan of £175,000 was issued to the Birkbeck Students' Union. The loan was issued to support
their return to a position of financial sustainability. The loan is repayable over seven years and no interest is
charged. The loan outstanding as at 31 July 2024 was £30,000.
At the year-end, there was a balance due to the Students' Union of £417,000 (2022/23: £19,000) and a
balance of £480,000 due from the Students' Union (2022/23: Nil).

25 Pension schemes
Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
• Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS); and
• The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL).
Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered
funds.
The total cost charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure was:

(i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)
The University participates in Universities Superannuation Scheme. The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,
providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the
scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the
assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution
is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify
its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As
required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as
if it were a wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the Income and
Expenditure represents the contributions payable to the scheme.
Where a scheme valuation determines that the scheme is in deficit on a technical provisions basis (as was
the case following the 2020 valuation), the trustee of the scheme must agree a Recovery Plan that
determines how each employer within the scheme will fund an overall deficit. The institution recognises a
liability for the contributions payable that arise from such an agreement (to the extent that they relate to a
deficit) with related expenses being recognised through the income statement.
FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of
a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme
is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such
as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer
has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results
in the recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that
they relate to the deficit) with the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.
University Governors are satisfied that the Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a
multi-employer scheme.
The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2023 (the
valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method.

(i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)
Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the
following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.
The 2023 valuation was the seventh valuation for the scheme prepared under the scheme-specific funding
regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective
to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of
the assets of the scheme was £73.1 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £65.7
billion indicating a surplus of £7.4 billion and a funding ratio of 111%.
The key financial assumptions used in the 2023 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the
Statement of Funding Principles (https://www.uss.co.uk/about-us/valuation-and-funding/statement-of-
funding-principles).
Principal Actuarial Assumptions 31 March 2023 valuation - technical provisions
Price inflation - Consumer Prices Index (CPI) 3.0% p.a. (based on a long-term average expected
level of CPI, broadly consistent with long-term market
expectations)
RPI/ CPI gap 1.0% p.a. to 2030, reducing to 0.1% p.a. from 2030
Pension increase (subject to a floor of 0%) Benefits with no cap:
CPI assumption plus 0.03%.
Benefits subject to a “soft cap” of 5% (providing
inflationary increases up to 5%, and half of any
excess inflation over 5% up to a maximum of 10%)
CPI assumption minus 0.03%.
Discount rate (forward rates) Fixed interest gilt yield curve plus:
Pre-retirement: 2.5% p.a.
Post retirement: 0.9% p.a.
The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based
on analysis of the scheme's experience carried out as part of the 2023 actuarial valuation. The mortality
assumptions used in these figures are as follows:
Mortality base table 2023 Valuation
101.0% of S2PMA "light" for males and 95.0% of
S3PFA for females.
Future improvements to mortality CMI_2021 with a smoothing parameter of 7.5, an
initial addition of 0.4% p.a., 10% w2020 and w2021
parameters, and a long term improvement rate of
1.8% pa for males and 1.6% pa for females.

Total scheme liabilities £65.7bn £80.6bn
FRS 102 total scheme surplus/ (deficit) £7.4bn £(14.1)bn
FRS 102 total funding level 111.0% 82.5%
A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2020 valuation which required payment of 6.2% of
salaries over the period 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2024, at which point the rate would increase to 6.3%. As
set out in note 17, no deficit recovery plan was required under the 2023 valuation because the scheme was
in surplus on a technical provisions basis. The University was no longer required to make deficit recovery
contributions from 1 January 2024 and accordingly released the outstanding provision to the Income and
Expenditure.
At 31 July 2023, the institution’s balance sheet included a liability of £29,044 million for future contributions
payable under the deficit recovery agreement which was concluded on 30 September 2021, following the
2020 valuation when the scheme was in deficit. No deficit recovery plan was required from the 2023
valuation, because the scheme was in surplus. Changes to contribution rates were implemented from 1
January 2024 and from that date the institution was no longer required to make deficit recovery
contributions. The remaining liability of £28,742 million was released to the profit and loss account. Further
disclosures relating to the deficit recovery liability can be found in note 17.
Employer and employee contribution rates for the scheme during the last three years were:
Employer Employee
From January 2024 14.5% 6.1%
From April 2022 21.6% 9.8%
From October 2021 21.4% 9.8%
(ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)
General description of the Pension Scheme
Birkbeck participates in the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London ("SAUL"), which is a
centralised defined benefit scheme within the United Kingdom and was contracted out of the Second State
Pension (prior to April 2016).
SAUL is an independently-managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
institutions with links to higher education.
Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings
("CARE") basis.

(ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL) continued
Individuals joining SAUL from 1 April 2023 are automatically enrolled into SAUL Start (a defined contribution
scheme) for the first three years of membership. After three years of membership members are automatically
transferred to SAUL Care however members can opt to remain in SAUL Start. SAUL Start is managed by Legal
& General.
Birkbeck is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current or participating employer's obligations
under the Rules of SAUL, but in the event of an insolvency of any participating employer within SAUL, an
amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the next actuarial valuation.
Funding Policy
SAUL's statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
the Trustee in paying SAUL's benefits as they fall due (the "Technical Provisions"). The Trustee adopts
assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits
already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued
pension rights to be met.
The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events turning
out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove the risk
that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.
A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2023.
Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.
The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2023 and will be reviewed again at
SAUL's next formal valuation in 2026.
At 31 March 2023 valuation SAUL was 105% funded on its Technical Provisions basis (31 March 2020:
94%). As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at that date, no deficit contributions were
required. The Trustee and the Employers have agreed that the ongoing Employers' contributions will reduce
from a rate of 21% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE salaries from 1 September 2024.
Employer contribution rates for SAUL Start are set at 16%, employee contribution rates are the same as for
the defined benefit scheme.
Accounting Policy
Birkbeck is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and does not
identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of SAUL's
assets at 31 March 2023 was £3,096 million representing 105% of the liabilities.
It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.
Birkbeck accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and pension costs
are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs 28.11 of FRS
102.
As there was a Technical Provision surplus at 31 March 2023, no deficit contributions were required
following the 2023 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit
contributions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the University.
