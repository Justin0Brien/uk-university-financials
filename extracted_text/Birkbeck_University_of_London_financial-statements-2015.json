This five year plan covers a period following recovery  \n          from significant turbulence in the HE sector. The impact of the 2012    \n          funding policy changes to undergraduate fees and funding led to         \n          reductions of 40% in the numbers of new part-time and mature            \n          students nationally. Over the three years since 2012 our own part       \n          time degree intake has halved and we have taken concerted action        \n          to recover student numbers, most notably in the continuing              \n          expansion of intensive three year undergraduate degree provision.       \n          Demand for these programmes has increased significantly across all      \n          Schools as we ensure our course provision responds to changing          \n          student needs and capitalises fully on our reputation and brand         \n          position at the forefront of the part-time sector.                      \n                                                                                  \n          We positioned ourselves financially in anticipation of the impact of the 2012 changes, building\n          upon the major transformation we delivered in successfully responding to the withdrawal of\n          funding for ELQ (equivalent or lower qualifications) in 2009. Since then the College has\n          intentionally built up the strength of its base operating position, returning operating surpluses\n          between 6.5% and 9.2% between 2010/11 and 2014/15.                      \n                                                                                  \n          We are planning to deliver a similar performance in the future, putting us in a position to further\n          invest in the development of academic provision, facilities, student support and research. While\n          our financial forecasts reflect the income consequences of reduced part-time student intakes,\n          they also include the positive contribution of the expanding three year intensive provision, the\n          impact of improved student retention and the impact of continuing cost reduction, control and\n          value for money initiatives.                                            \n                                                                                  \n          A major area of growth over 2015-2020 will be the continuing expansion of demand and\n          provision of intensive evening degrees for a younger body of students from the London area and\n          beyond who wish to combine study with work and complete their degree in three or four years.\n          We will develop and offer appropriate facilities and support to maintain a diverse body of younger\n          students on these programmes.                                           \n          We will also maintain our commitment to open, inclusive and flexible opportunities for all\n          Londoners, by maintaining part-time pathways in all subject areas allowing people to combine\n          evening study with work and other commitments. We will continue to ask for policy interventions\n          to support this student body and ensure that lifelong learning is maintained; and we will continue\n          to develop and offer a range of open, inclusive and low risk pathways into undergraduate study\n          through our Certificate of HE programme, the largest in the country.    \n                                                                                  \n          We are committed to maintaining a broad portfolio accessible to diverse student populations,\n          both in terms of our mission and to mitigate the risk of unexpected policy and market changes.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 6 of 53",

Professor Warner joined Birkbeck in September 2014 and lectures on literature and\n          creative writing.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n          In March 2015, Professor Warner was also awarded one of the world’s most prestigious scholarly\n          prizes, The Holberg Prize, beating over 70 nominees from universities across the globe.\n          The award – worth approximately £380,000 – is presented annually to scholars who have made\n          outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social science, law or theology.\n          Professor Warner received this year’s honour for her work on the analysis of stories and myths\n          and how they reflect their time and place.                              \n          For the second time in three years a Birkbeck psychologist has been awarded the Spearman\n          Medal. Dr Iroise Dumontheil, a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Psychological Sciences, was\n          named as this year’s recipient for her work investigating a region of the brain at the crossroads of\n          executive control and social cognition. The Spearman Medal – inaugurated in 1965 and the\n          oldest award of the British Psychological Society - is awarded annually to an early-career\n          psychologist for outstanding published work in psychology, and has been won by many of the\n          major figures in UK psychology.                                         \n                                                                                  \n          Dr Mai Sato, Research Fellow in the Institute for Criminal Policy Research in Birkbeck’s School of\n          Law, was awarded the Young Criminologist 2014 prize by the Japanese Association of\n          Sociological Criminology for her book The Death Penalty in Japan: Will the Public Tolerate\n          Abolition? Dr Sato completed her PhD in 2011 which examined public attitudes to the death\n          penalty in Japan. Dr Sato is currently funded by the UK, German and Norwegian embassies to\n          conduct further empirical work on the death penalty in Japan.           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 7 of 53",

Professor Moran, Director LLM/MA in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at Birkbeck’s\n          School of Law, has been involved in a number of pioneering research projects focusing on\n          sexuality in criminal justice contexts. Most recently his research has focused on hate crime.\n          A Birkbeck alumnus has been awarded the Légion d'Honneur for his involvement in the\n          emancipation of France during World War II. Dr Tony Atcherley who is now 90 studied Philosophy\n          at Birkbeck in the 1950’s at the College’s Faculty of Continuing Education. Dr Atcherley received\n          the accolade – the highest decoration in France – in recognition of his service as a wireless\n          operator in the Royal Corps of Signals. Dr Atcherley confirmed that the unique mission of\n          Birkbeck was as true when he studied as it was when the College was founded in 1823. After\n          receiving his award he stated: “Back then, it was difficult to go to university if you didn’t have the\n          normal background of completing a grammar school education and so on. Getting on to the\n          ladder was difficult. The only chance anyone had was Birkbeck. It had a fine reputation and some\n          famous historians were there. It was full of very distinguished scholars.”\n                                                                                  \n          Research                                                                \n                                                                                  \n          Maintaining and developing the research excellence of the College is, of course, central to our\n          overall strategy ensuring that our unique population of students is taught by those at the cutting\n          edge of their subject who apply research insights to their teaching.    \n                                                                                  \n          The results of the 2014 Research Excellent Framework (REF) were released at the end of 2014\n          and convincingly demonstrated Birkbeck’s position as a high quality research intensive\n          institution. Approximately three-quarters of the research submitted by the College was rated\n          either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). This represents a considerable\n          improvement on the results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) when 56% of our\n          research was rated 4* or 3*, paralleling the considerable improvement overall in the sector.\n          Part of this overall improvement in the sector was the result of strategic decisions of individual\n          universities to submit a lower proportion of their staff for assessment. Most importantly, Birkbeck\n          submitted 83% of eligible staff for assessment, well above the national average. This resulted in\n          our appearing higher up in league tables which took into account percentage of staff submitted\n          rather than simply overall grade point average of research. For example, the table in the Times\n          Higher Education magazine on 1st January 2015 placed us 30th overall, above Russell group\n          members such as Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, Queen Mary, Sheffield and York. Similarly, the College\n          performed strongly in league tables based simply on percentage of 4* research submitted\n          indicating the very high quality of much of our research.               \n                                                                                  \n          The College’s science submissions performed particularly well, with Psychological Sciences rated\n          5th in the UK and the two joint submissions with UCL – Earth Systems & Environmental Sciences,\n          and Biological Sciences – rated 6th and 11th respectively. Birkbeck’s outstanding subjects in the\n          Times Higher Education’s ‘research-intensity’ league tables include Law, ranked 6th overall and\n          History, ranked 7th.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 8 of 53",

The College did well in these specific areas with eight of our\n          submissions (Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, Biological Sciences, Earth Systems &\n          Environmental Science, Law, Modern Languages/Linguistics, English, History and Art & Design)\n          achieving the highest ratings for research environment. This confirmed the College’s status as\n          one of the UK’s leading institutions in which to conduct research. Similarly, three of these areas,\n          Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience, History and Art & Design also scored 100% in the impact\n          area indicating the manner in which our research is applied to specific issues in the outside\n          world.                                                                  \n          Although the figures on research environment and research impact are good they lagged behind\n          the scores for research publications. This indicated that it may be appropriate to provide further\n          institutional support for research policy, strategy and infrastructure as well as continuing the\n          College Anniversary Research Studentships.                              \n                                                                                  \n          Overall, this was an excellent performance made particularly impressive by the fact that the\n          research being assessed was conducted whilst the College was passing through two major\n          student funding crises (the removal of funding for students undertaking a second undergraduate\n          degree and the increase in tuition fees to £9,000, both of which impacted significantly on part\n          time student numbers) with College staff being strongly focused on teaching and student\n          recruitment, potentially at the expense of their research activity.     \n                                                                                  \n          We are now considering how to continue our improvement in research at a rate greater than the\n          rest of the sector prior to the next REF. It is likely that this strategy will include a focus on career\n          development which focuses on both teaching and research.                \n                                                                                  \n          In the science area, creating career development opportunities were a key part of the £600,000\n          award to the College from the Wellcome Trust under the Institutional Strategic Support Fund\n          (ISSF). The College was invited to compete for this award as one of the 25 UK Higher Education\n          Institutions with the greatest funding from the Wellcome Trust. We were successful in this\n          competitive process, with an application which emphasized our strengths not only in Biological\n          Sciences but also in the Medical Humanities, an area also funded by the Wellcome Trust. The\n          funding supported an appointment in the area of public understanding of science, several\n          Fellowship appointments for young researchers to prepare for their first independent position\n          and pump priming research funds for those who already held an independent position. A novel\n          aspect of the scheme was to provide assistance to PhD students who have submitted their thesis\n          but needed a further period of funding to complete their scientific publications ready for\n          submission. Several of these funding schemes may be mimicked in future with College funds\n          across areas outside the scope of the ISSF support.                     \n          In terms of the financial support for research, it is pleasing to report that despite an increasingly\n          competitive environment for project-based research funding, the College’s research income\n          released to the Income and Expenditure Account remained relatively stable at £10.4 million in\n          2014/15 (2013/14: £11.1 million). The number of new grants awarded during the year was 49\n          totalling £7.6 million.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 9 of 53",

This table\n          has become even more competitive as a greater number of universities, particularly from Asia,\n          compete for recognition.                                                \n                                                                                  \n          Estates                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          It is of vital importance that we provide the very best facilities for our research, as well as\n          ensuring that high quality teaching facilities are provided for students. Each year we put aside\n          funding from our own resources to carry out a number of improvement projects (14/15 revenue\n          budget £700,000; 15/16 revenue budget £500,000) on top of undertaking minor works and\n          routine maintenance.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n          Although Government/HEFCE funding for capital facilities has been greatly reduced in recent\n          years, we have been successful in obtaining matched funding of £650,000 from HEFCE for new\n          Earth Sciences Laboratories. With a total development cost of £1.3 million, the laboratories will\n          greatly enhance the research and teaching facilities available to the College and since they will\n          also be used by UCL during the day, will further the close links between two academic\n          departments which proved so successful in the recent REF. The new laboratory was opened at\n          the end of September 2015 and includes an innovative interaction between PC and microscope\n          which is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK.                \n          The model of evening use of teaching facilities by Birkbeck and daytime use by a partner is of\n          considerable significance for the future of the College. Following recent property transfers within\n          our joint building with UEL in Stratford, much of the space is now used by UEL in the daytime and\n          by us in the evening. Similarly, the SOAS development in the North Block of Senate House is\n          predicated on our use of the facilities in the evening with SOAS being the users during the day.\n                                                                                  \n          This joint use of facilities provides us with an effective say in the management of the teaching\n          facilities we are using whilst providing us with a partner to share the cost in their construction\n          and running. Moreover, electronic signage allows the space to be identified as Birkbeck space\n          from 6.00 pm, so providing our students with the feeling that they are studying in Birkbeck\n          facilities rather in a random space which is available for rental during the evening.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 10 of 53",

Some of the space is not of the high standard that we\n          would like to offer all our students and in some cases operational challenges have been\n          experienced. It is now a strategic objective that by our 200th anniversary in 2023 all Birkbeck\n          students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or in shared facilities operating\n          on a similar basis to the projects with UEL and SOAS.                   \n          We have been planning the development of a new building to house a Toddler Laboratory for the\n          Department of Psychological Sciences, building on the great success of the Baby Laboratory in\n          terms of identifying early markers of autism, potentially allowing much earlier interventions\n          before the onset of the symptoms.

With an estates strategy that focuses\n          on research and the need to increase the amount of owned teaching space, the College\n          commenced a process to find suitable freehold property in the locality of the main College\n          buildings in Bloomsbury.

The options under\n          consideration range from simple refurbishment to demolition and construction. Uses could\n          include research or office space.

Our research indicates that this provision appeals more and\n          more to younger prospective students from backgrounds where university study is not the norm\n          and who would otherwise not go to university, as well as to students who want or need to work\n          while studying and would prefer a more intensive evening model. In response to higher fees and\n          difficult economic circumstances, these students have a preference to realise the benefits of\n          completed study sooner rather than later, and to have a flexible study model that gives far\n          greater scope, and far more explicit support, for interactions with the world of work whilst\n          studying. Meanwhile for some young students, intensive evening study may become the only\n          alternative to not studying at all                                      \n          Just as significantly, this trend increasingly determines study preferences in the postgraduate\n          market. A postgraduate qualification is seen as increasingly important in career advancement,\n          yet at the postgraduate level there is clear under representation of certain groups of non-\n          traditional students. Even with postgraduate student loans, which under current plans will not be\n          available for mature students at all, such students may well see the intensive evening route as\n          the only way to make study at Master’s level affordable and accessible. \n                                                                                  \n          We will continue with our Catalyst programme (initially funded by HEFCE) to pioneer the\n          development and delivery of innovative, flexible and accelerated evening provision at both\n          undergraduate and postgraduate taught levels, building on our sector-leading expertise in\n          supporting adult learning.

We will bring further\n          innovation to the classroom, in the context of clearly changing student circumstances and needs,\n          evaluate and, where appropriate, integrate into the College’s course portfolio innovative teaching\n          and learning practice and new delivery technologies, including expansion of online and distance\n          learning provision, underpinned by both our own resources and by opportunities for collaboration\n          and partnership where there is a strategic fit.                         \n                                                                                  \n          With a Teaching Excellence Framework under consideration by the government the College has\n          always been committed to teaching excellence.

Looking\n          further ahead, we will be defining our ambitions and vision for Birkbeck in 2023, when the\n          College will celebrate its 200th anniversary.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Professor David S.

The continuing growth in our new full-time evening\n          undergraduate programmes coupled with a third cohort of students paying the higher\n          undergraduate fee, has increased our primary source of income. Income from tuition fees and\n          support grants represents 60.2% of total income (2013/14: 57%).         \n                                        2013/14 2013/14 2014/15 2014/15           \n                                        headcount £’000 headcount £’000           \n                                                                                  \n          Full time students (number/income) 2,759 21,622  3,494 28,137           \n          Part time students (number/income) 11,241 33,940 9,931 33,747           \n          Support grant income                -   2,234       -   2,003           \n                                                                                  \n          Total                           14,000 57,796   13,425 63,887           \n          Table 2: Student numbers and tuition income                             \n                                                                                  \n          Although the increasing study intensity chosen by students has resulted in an increase in income\n          it has required only modest adjustments to our cost base this year and, therefore, an increased\n          surplus.

The year on year increase in administration and central services costs\n          of 3.8% is largely the result of further enhancements to student support.\n                                                                                  \n          A September 2015 Times Higher Education review of 2013/14 staff data submitted to the\n          Higher Education Statistics Agency indicated that Birkbeck had one of the lowest percentages of\n          support staff in the sector. 45% of staff at Birkbeck in 2013/14 were classified as support staff.\n          Across the sector, 111 out of 157 higher education institutions had the majority of their staff\n          providing support.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n          The surplus of 9.2% of turnover generated £11.2 million of cash from operating activities. This\n          helped to facilitate the purchase of a building for £15.4 million which will contribute to our\n          strategic objective to teach the majority of our students in space owned or jointly operated by the\n          College. Generating cash from operating activities is a core financial objective as it will allow the\n          College to continue to improve and expand infrastructure and the estate for the benefit of\n          teaching and research. As a charity, it is also important for the College to maintain a level of cash\n          to manage risk and uncertainty. Total cash reserves at the year end (excluding endowments and\n          long term investments) totalled £41.6 million (2013/14: £41.7 million). \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 16 of 53",

Surpluses for the last five years have\n          exceeded 6.5% of total income which in turn has resulted in an increase in cash and current\n          asset investments of £14.8 million over the same period. £12.9 million (net after depreciation)\n          has also been reinvested in fixed assets since 2010/11 and the College has limited exposure to\n          long term loans (£48,000 at 31 July 2015).                              \n                                                                                  \n          A focus on strong financial management has kept costs in line with budget with staff costs as a\n          percentage of total income falling from 68.3% in 2009/10 to a more sustainable 57.3% in\n          2014/15. The College contributed £6.7 million, 6.3% of total income, (2013/14: £6.6 million,\n          6.5% of total income) to pension schemes by way of employer contributions, a figure which will\n          rise from April 2016. Triennial valuations from the two main pension schemes, SAUL and USS,\n          have confirmed that both funds have a deficit of assets compared to an estimate of future\n          liabilities. These increases will coincide with the introduction of an increase in the rate of\n          employer’s National Insurance contributions.                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 17 of 53",

As a research intensive institution based in London with\n          no additional income from student residences, the College recognises the added importance of\n          managing this metric. As noted earlier, the percentage has fallen from 68.3% in 2009/10 and\n          the College has a target of not exceeding 60%.                          \n                                                                                  \n          Purchase of subsidiary                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          During the year the College purchased the freehold for a building on the Euston Road. The\n          building will be renovated to house scientific research or offices. Surveys are currently being\n          undertaken to determine whether the sensitive equipment used by the researchers can be\n          located in the building which has a close proximity to an underground line. In the event that this\n          is not possible, administrative activity will be relocated, thereby freeing space in the main\n          campus for development for teaching.                                    \n                                                                                  \n          The building was previously owned by a special purpose company set up by a property developer.\n          The building was the only asset of the company. Having taken professional advice, the College\n          determined that purchasing the company was considered an appropriate mechanism to gain title\n          to the building. The Financial Statements provide data on the financial affairs of the College and\n          also the Group position after consolidating the new, wholly owned, subsidiary. The impact of the\n          purchase on the Balance Sheets can be summarised as follows:            \n                                                   2015   2015    2014            \n                                                                                  \n                                                  Group  College College          \n                                          Note     £000   £000    £000            \n                                                                                  \n          Tangible Assets                        51,497  51,714  60,396           \n          Purchase of new building               15,617       -      -            \n                                                                                  \n          Tangible Assets                  8     67,114  51,714  60,396           \n                                                                                  \n          Investments                            12,715  12,715  12,315           \n          Purchase of new subsidiary                  -  15,617      -            \n          Fixed Asset Investments          9     12,715  28,332  12,315           \n                                                                                  \n          Table 5: Extract from Group and College Balance Sheets                  \n                                     Page 18 of 53",

The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n          The College Risk Register is compiled by the risk management group consisting of senior\n          academic and professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are\n          identified and evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The Risk Register is\n          considered by the Strategic Planning Committee and Audit Committee and approved by the\n          Governors. The risks are grouped by themes, for which Key Performance Indicators linked to\n          strategic objectives have been established. These will be monitored by Strategic Planning\n          Committee, Audit Committee and Governors.                               \n                                                                                  \n          The College continues to monitor adherence to risk management procedures and processes to\n          ensure that the Audit Committee and the Governors can be satisfied that risks are systematically\n          recognised, assessed and managed. An annual review of effectiveness of internal control and the\n          on-going identification and evaluation of significant risks is considered by the Strategic Planning\n          Committee and Audit Committee.                                          \n                                                                                  \n          The top three risks identified for the College for 2015/16 and a summary of the mitigating\n          actions are as follows:                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          •     Financial sustainability: one of the principal aims of our mission is to “provide flexible\n                higher education courses which meet the changing educational, cultural, personal and\n                career needs of adults; in particular those who live or work in the London region”. The\n                continuing fall in the number of part time students across the sector has created budget\n                uncertainty for the College for a number of years. Although we continue to lobby\n                government to act to stem this reduction, the success of the introduction of three year\n                full time undergraduate evening programmes has reduced the funding gap. Current\n                financial forecasts assume a degree of growth in full time undergraduate recruitments\n                but the removal of the Student Number Control in 2015/16 introduces a new\n                uncertainty. Student funding for postgraduate programmes is widely expected to\n                become more challenging for the sector once the first cohort of higher fee paying\n                undergraduates graduate at the end of 2014/15. Tuition fee income remains the core\n                element of our business and as such ensuring that we meet our targets will always be a\n                risk requiring significant effort. in response to current demand trends, the College has\n                scoped projects to improve and extend flexible evening study along with student and\n                learning support, enabling students to better combine work and study.\n                In the short term we will continue to ensure that expenditure is robustly controlled such\n                that forecast surpluses are maintained and reserves are enhanced to allow us to\n                develop our infrastructure and estate. Prudent budgets will continue to include\n                appropriate contingencies to help manage any income deficiencies and adjustments to\n                spend plans will be made in year where required. In the medium term, provision will be\n                expanded where there is demand and the academic portfolio will be flexibly developed\n                to remain distinctive and attractive to our students.

The National Student Survey (NSS) and\n                metrics on retention, completion, achievement and employment provide vital data. The\n                NSS is currently being revised and a new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) which is\n                potentially linked to funding is being drafted by the government. \n                                                                                  \n                The College is contributing to the government consultation on the TEF to ensure that the\n                notion of students reaching their “full potential” is appropriately measured. The Pro-\n                Vice-Master for Learning and Teaching is overseeing a range of projects which aim to\n                dissect the range of student satisfaction metrics with a view to introducing\n                improvements and feedback is actively sought from students on a range of issues. The\n                role of the Students’ Union in representation is being developed with the support of the\n                Academic Registrar. A Student Engagement Strategy, drawing together services,\n                initiatives and projects to improve student support and advice, access,\n                communications, social engagement and career support will commence implementation\n                during 2015/16.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          •     Research standing: a principal aim of our mission is to “maintain and develop\n                excellence in research and provide the highest quality research training in all our\n                subject areas.” Retaining our reputation as a world class research intensive institution\n                is vital to our mission and is also a key aspect of why students choose to study with us\n                and excellent academic staff wish to join us. An updated research strategy was\n                approved in 2015 following publication of the Research Excellence Framework (REF)\n                results in 2014 and preparation is already under way for the next REF with a focus on\n                planning and leadership. The Pro-Vice-Master Research chairs regular meetings of a\n                REF working group and leads of units of assessment have been appointed with a role\n                description setting out responsibilities and expectations. Key Performance Indicators for\n                research have been established and will be monitored by the Research Committee and\n                as part of the overall KPI monitoring exercise by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit\n                Committee and Governors.                                          \n                                                                                  \n          Despite the persistent challenge of recruiting students in an extremely competitive market and\n          the additional contributions we will need to make in respect of National Insurance and pensions,\n          our financial strategy for the future is based on annual surpluses of at least 5% of total income.\n          We believe that this is achievable, will allow us to invest in teaching and research and also\n          provide cash to invest in capital assets including our estate.          \n                                                                                  \n          On behalf of the Governing Body, I would like to thank all staff for their dedication and support in\n          ensuring the success of Birkbeck and its unique mission as a research-led teaching institution\n          with a strong commitment to flexible patterns of teaching.              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Mr Harvey McGrath                                                       \n          Chair of Governors                                                      \n                                     Page 20 of 53",

The Governing Body has\n          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in\n          the following manner.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College aims to provide higher education opportunities to people who would not otherwise\n          have access, continuing the mission since its inception. The College’s founder, George Birkbeck,\n          had a vision of the power of education to transform and improve lives, and this founding\n          commitment to social change and widening access is a core strand of what still drives the\n          College today. The College’s mission includes “enabling students from diverse social and\n          educational backgrounds to participate”. As London’s only specialist provider of flexible evening\n          higher education, Birkbeck has long encouraged applications from students without traditional\n          qualifications or from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. \n                                                                                  \n          We attract a very high proportion of students with low incomes. 45% of our undergraduate\n          students were from households with an income of under £25,000, rising to 51% of full-time\n          students. These students received a Birkbeck bursary to support their study. The ethnicity of our\n          students demonstrates that we are attracting a very diverse student body, with 58% of our full-\n          time undergraduate students from BME backgrounds.                       \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck has long aimed to offer opportunities to mature students. Mature and part-time\n          students have been most affected by the increase in tuition fees in 2012, and are often\n          overlooked by the university sector. As part of our commitment to supporting mature students,\n          we have developed a free and impartial Information Advice and Guidance service, in partnership\n          with University of East London, where mature students are able to receive the support required to\n          make an informed decision. We also fund an innovative outreach programme of events to\n          engage mature students and we offer Certificates of Higher Education that offer a supportive and\n          lower risk entry to higher education to those without traditional entry qualifications. Birkbeck has\n          a long-standing agreement with Unionlearn to give employed people the opportunity to increase\n          their education level.                                                  \n          As well as the expenditure on financial support, we spend considerable amounts on ensuring that\n          our students are successful while they are with us, and that they are well placed in the jobs\n          market on graduation. Our evening provision uniquely enables students to combine study in the\n          evening with meaningful work during the day. In order to support students to gain paid and\n          meaningful job placements we have invested in our capacity to provide a particular type of\n          careers support and a new service to create job brokerage called Birkbeck Talent.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 21 of 53",

Pears Foundation previously donated £1.5 million to\n          Birkbeck in 2010 which facilitated both the establishment of the Pears Institute for the Study of\n          Antisemitism and the relocation of the Wiener Library to the Birkbeck campus.\n                                                                                  \n          The Pears Institute is the only centre in the UK, and one of just two in Europe, whose mission is\n          to promote understanding of antisemitism. The Institute has gained an international reputation\n          for its innovative approach to the study of antisemitism and to exploring the connections\n          between antisemitism and other forms of racism and intolerance.

Instead, it is funded by an international library consortium whose\n          members recognise that the greatest benefit for the academy and society will only be realised\n          when access to scholarly work is not based on an exclusionary pay-to-read system. Since opening\n          for library partnerships earlier this year, over 80 institutions from around the world have already\n          signed up to support the platform financially, many pledging multi-year support upfront. The grant\n          will be used to build the sustainability model for the platform, to expand the number of journals\n          published by the OLH and to build open-source and free XML typesetting and translation\n          software.                                                               \n          The advancement of health or saving of lives                            \n                                                                                  \n          A £500,000 grant from MQ: Transforming Mental Health (a charity formed to support research\n          into mental health) has helped to fund a study led by scientists at Birkbeck to investigate\n          whether computer-based intervention can improve attention control in infants at familial risk of\n          Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).                        \n                                                                                  \n          The project will take a new approach to developing early interventions for ADHD, a condition\n          which affects up to 5% of the general population and can cause difficulties paying attention,\n          controlling behaviour and hyperactivity. The researchers will undertake a trial of computer-based\n          attention training for infants who are at increased risk for ADHD because they have an older\n          sibling or parent with the condition. The training approach uses state of the art technology to link\n          attention allocation to rewarding images on the screen. An eye tracker can tell exactly where an\n          infant is looking on a computer screen and infants can control what they will see next by where\n          they look. This approach has already been shown to strengthen concentration and attention in\n          typically developing infants. The researchers are interested in whether these effects can also be\n          seen in infants at risk for ADHD.                                       \n          The prevention or relief of poverty                                     \n                                                                                  \n          During the year, the College was accredited as a London Living Wage employer by the Living\n          Wage Foundation.

This summary describes\n          the manner in which the College has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the UK\n          Corporate Governance Code (2014) insofar as they relate to universities. Its purpose is to help\n          the reader of the accounts understand how the principles have been applied.\n          The Governing Body                                                      \n          The Governing Body (“Governors”) comprises lay members, students, alumni and employees\n          appointed under the Statutes of the College, the majority of whom are non-executive. There is a\n          majority of lay members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the Governing Body are\n          separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.    \n                                                                                  \n          The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and\n          Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities and under the\n          Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability with the Higher Education Funding Council for\n          England. The Governing Body is responsible for the ongoing strategic direction of the College,\n          approval of major developments and the receipt of regular reports from Senior Management on\n          the day to day operations of its business.                              \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body is responsible for the College's system of internal control and for reviewing\n          its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to\n          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance\n          against material misstatement or loss.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including\n          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and\n          Remuneration Committee. All of these committees are formally constituted with terms of\n          reference. All lay members of the Governing Body are appointed to committees by the Governors\n          on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.                     \n          The Governing Body reviewed its effectiveness in 2013/14 in line with the expectations of HEFCE\n          and the Committee for University Chairs for regular effectiveness reviews. The review concluded\n          that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The review put in place\n          measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to give Governors more\n          opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal Governors’ meetings.\n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE Code of\n          Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of the Code. It will\n          keep under review its effectiveness and continue to seek to enhance governance processes and\n          practices in line with the provisions of the Code.

The employee members\n          have no involvement in determining their own salaries.                  \n          The Remuneration Committee met once during the year.                    \n                                                                                  \n          Equalities Committee                                                    \n          The Equalities Committee promotes equality and diversity among staff and students across the\n          College by:                                                             \n                                                                                  \n           monitoring College policy on equal opportunities and diversity, recommending the\n            introduction of new policy as appropriate and issuing guidelines on new initiatives;\n           monitoring developments in legislation and making recommendations for any necessary\n            changes required to policy and practice;                              \n           developing and ensuring implementation of the College’s Single Equality Strategy and other\n            related policies.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          The Committee makes an annual report on equal opportunities monitoring and developments in\n          equality and diversity to the Governors.                                \n                                                                                  \n          The Committee met twice during the year.                                \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 27 of 53",

Internal audit also helps the\n          College accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating\n          and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and, by\n          working with management, adding value through advice and guidance. All reviews undertaken by\n          internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit.

Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion, on the\n          financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing\n          (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s\n          Ethical Standards for Auditors.                                         \n                                                                                  \n          Scope of the audit of the financial statements                          \n                                                                                  \n          An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial\n          statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from\n          material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:\n          whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and College’s circumstances and\n          have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant\n          accounting estimates made by the Governing Body; and the overall presentation of the financial\n          statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Operating\n          and Financial Review to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If\n          we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the\n          implications for our report.                                            \n          Opinion on financial statements                                         \n                                                                                  \n          In our opinion the financial statements:                                \n              give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Group and the College as at 31\n               July 2015 and of the Group’s income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and\n               cash flows for the year then ended;                                \n              have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted\n               Accounting Practice; and                                           \n              have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice –\n               Accounting for Further and Higher Education.                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 30 of 53",

Income from donations is\n          recognised when it is received.                                         \n                                                                                  \n          Recurrent grants from the Funding Council are recognised in the period in which they are\n          receivable.                                                             \n          Non-recurrent grants from the Funding Council or other bodies received in respect of the\n          acquisition or construction of fixed assets are treated as deferred capital grants and amortised in\n          line with depreciation over the life of the assets.                     \n                                                                                  \n          Income from academic fees is recognised in the period for which it is receivable and includes all\n          fees payable by students or their sponsors.                             \n                                                                                  \n          Pension schemes                                                         \n          Retirements benefits for most employees of the College are provided by the Universities\n          Superannuation Scheme (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of\n          London (SAUL). These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted\n          out of the State Second Pension Scheme. The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee\n          administered funds. Contributions to the schemes are determined by qualified actuaries on the\n          basis of triennial valuations using the Projected Unit Method. Reviews of the scheme positions\n          are carried out in the period between valuations.                       \n                                                                                  \n          It is not possible to identify the College's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the\n          schemes. Therefore contributions are accounted for as if the schemes were defined contribution\n          schemes and pension costs are based on the contributions payable in the year. Differences\n          between contributions payable and contributions paid are shown as either accruals or\n          prepayments on the balance sheet.                                       \n                                     Page 32 of 53",

Accordingly, the College is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or\n          capital gains received within categories covered by Chapter 3 Part 11 of the Corporation Tax Act\n          2010 or Section 256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such\n          income or gains are applied exclusively to charitable purposes.         \n                                                                                  \n          The College is partially exempt in respect of Value Added Tax so that it can only recover a minor\n          element of VAT charged on its inputs. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is included in the costs of such\n          inputs and added to the cost of tangible fixed assets as appropriate, where the inputs\n          themselves are tangible fixed assets by nature.                         \n                                                                                  \n          The wholly owned subsidiary company is registered for VAT and is subject to UK Corporation Tax\n          and VAT in the same way as any commercial organisation. The subsidiary and the College have\n          not formed a VAT group.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 35 of 53",

The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-\n           administered fund. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the scheme's assets are not hypothecated to\n           individual institutions and a scheme wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore exposed to actuarial\n           risks associated with other institutions' employees and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and\n           liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS17, accounts for the\n           scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure\n           account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.\n           Contingent Liabilities and Assets                                      \n           A contingent liability exists in relation to the pension valuation recovery plan, since the company is an employer of\n           members within the scheme. The contingent liability relates to the amount generated by past service of current members\n           and the associated proportion of the deficit. Given that the scheme is a multi‐employer scheme and the company is unable\n           to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities, the contingent liability is not recognised as a provision\n           on the balance sheet. The associated receivable from the scheme in respect of the reimbursement of the company’s\n           expenditure is similarly not recognised.                               \n           Pension costs                                                          \n           The company participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a defined benefit scheme which is\n           contracted out of the State Second Pension (S2P). The assets of the scheme are held in a separate fund administered\n           by the trustee, Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited. The company is required to contribute a specified\n           percentage of payroll costs to the pension scheme to fund the benefits payable to the company’s employees. In 2015,\n           the percentage was 16% (2014: 16%). The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and\n           liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 “Retirement\n           benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\n           The total cost charged to the income and expenditure account is shown at the foot of this note. There was neither\n           a prepayment nor an accrual at the end of the financial year in respect of these contributions. The disclosures below\n           represent the position from the scheme’s financial statements. The latest available triennial actuarial valuation of the\n           scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation date”), which was carried out using the projected unit method and is\n           currently being audited by the scheme auditor. Based on this 2014 valuation it is expected that employer contributions\n           will increase to 18% from 1 April 2016.                                \n           The 2014 valuation was the third valuation for USS under the scheme‐specific funding regime introduced by the\n           Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and\n           appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme\n           was £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion indicating a shortfall of\n           £5.3 billion. The assets therefore were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had accrued to members\n           after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.              \n           FRS 17 liability numbers have been produced using the following assumptions:\n                                                 2015    2014                     \n                                                                                  \n           Discount Rate                         3.3%    4.5%                     \n           Pensionable salary growth   3.5% in the first year and 4.4%            \n                                            4.0% thereafter                       \n           Price inflation (CPI)                 2.2%    2.6%                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 50 of 53",

SAUL is a \"last\n           man standing\" scheme so that in the event of the insolvency of any of the participating employers in SAUL, the\n           amount of any pension funding shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer will be\n           spread across the remaining participant employers and reflected in the next actuarial valuation. A formal valuation\n           of SAUL is carried out every three years by professionally qualified and independent actuaries using the Projected Unit\n           method. Informal reviews of SAUL's position are carried out between formal valuations.\n           The College participates in a centralised defined benefit scheme for all qualified employees with the assets held in\n           separate Trustee-administered funds. The College has now adopted FSR17 for accounting for pension costs. It\n           is not possible to identify the College's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL. Therefore contributions\n           are accounted for as if SAUL were a defined contribution scheme and pension costs are based on the amounts\n           actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs 8 - 12 of FRS17.\n           SAUL is subject to triennial valuations by professional qualified and independent actuaries. The last available\n           valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2011 using the projected unit credit method in which the actuarial liability\n           makes allowance for projected earnings.                                \n           The main assumptions used to assess the technical provisions were:     \n                                                                                  \n                                             31 March 2011                        \n           Discount rate                                                          \n            - pre-retirement                 6.80% p.a.                           \n            - post-retirement                4.70% p.a.                           \n           General* Salary Increases         3.75% p.a. until 31 March 2014, 4.50% p.a.\n                                             thereafter                           \n           Retail Prices Index Inflation (\"RPI\") 3.50% p.a.                       \n                                                                                  \n           Consumer Price Index Inflation (\"CPI\") 2.80% p.a.                      \n                                                                                  \n           Pension Increases in payment      2.80% p.a.                           \n           (excess over GMP)                                                      \n           Mortality - base table            SAPS Normal (year of birth) tables with an\n                                             age rating of +0.5 years for males and\n                                              -0.4 years for females.             \n           Mortality - future improvements   Future improvements in line with CMI 2010\n                                             projections with a long term trend of\n                                             1.25% p.a.                           \n           *an additional allowance is made for promotional salary increases      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                     Page 52 of 53",

As a whole, the market value of SAUL's assets was £1,506 million representing\n           95% of the liability for benefits after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.\n           Based on the strength of the Employer covenant and the Trustee's long-term investment strategy, the\n           Trustee and the Employers agreed to maintain Employer and Member contributions at 13% of Salaries\n           and 6% of Salaries respectively following the valuation. The above rates will be reviewed when the results\n           of the next formal valuation (as at 31 March 2014) are known.          \n                                                                                  \n           A comparison of SAUL's assets and liabilities calculated using assumptions consistent with FRS17\n           revealed SAUL to be in deficit at the last formal valuation date (31 March 2011). As part of this valuation,\n           the Trustee and Employer have agreed that no additional contributions will be required to eliminate the\n           current shortfall.                                                     \n           The more material changes (the introduction of a Career Average Revalued Earnings, or \"CARE\", benefit\n           structure) to SAUL's benefit structure will apply from 1 July 2012. As a consequence, the cost of benefit\n           accrual is expected to fall as existing final salary members are replaced by new members joining the\n           CARE structure. This will allow an increasing proportion of the expected asset return to be used to\n           eliminate the funding shortfall. Based on conditions as at 31 March 2011, the shortfall is expected to be\n           eliminated by 31 March 2021, which is 10 years from the valuation date.\n           The total pension cost for the College was:   2015     2014            \n                                                         £000     £000            \n           Contributions to USS                         5,672    5,601            \n           Contributions to SAUL                        1,072     9 91            \n                                                                                  \n           Total Pension Cost (Note 6)                  6,744    6,592            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        24.
