The forecast increase in income would        \n          cover the higher staff costs brought about by the change in pension     \n          and National Insurance contribution rates. The planned budget           \n          surplus of £5.5 million (calculated pre-FRS102) would continue to       \n          contribute to our reserves which underpin our long term estates and     \n          infrastructure plans.                                                   \n          However, student enrolments (FTE) were down 8% in 2015/16               \n          compared to 2014/15. This reduction was largely due to continuing       \n          declines in undergraduate part-time student numbers, which fell by      \n          18%, and a smaller decline of 5% in new enrolments to Masters           \n          courses.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n          Recruitment to full-time undergraduate programmes was steady following 5 years of rapid growth\n          although international recruitment fell slightly against a plan to maintain numbers.\n                                                                                  \n          Changing recruitment behaviour across the sector following the removal of the Student Number\n          Control has had an impact on our numbers, particularly at the “access” end of the market.\n          Expansion in the number of alternative providers in areas such as Law, Business and\n          Management, have also had a negative impact. Although we increased central marketing and\n          conversion activity throughout the year it became apparent that competitors had aggressively\n          targeted students from a wider spectrum than normal. To counter this, we improved the speed\n          with which we process applications, are undertaking an extended range of targeted and general\n          marketing activity and have increased the financial resource for advertising and conversion to\n          ensure that targets are met for 2016/17.                                \n                                                                                  \n          Under-recruitment of new students resulted in an income shortfall against budget of nearly £6.0\n          million in 2015/16. Our budget included a prudent contingency of £3.175 million and further\n          adjustments were identified mid-way through the year to ensure that the budget surplus was\n          achieved. However, the shortfall against recruitment target will have an impact on future levels of\n          income. We are planning to undertake a phased recovery to ensure that our financial strategy of\n          generating cash for investment in our estate and infrastructure is maintained.\n          The continuing decline in part-time undergraduate numbers is an issue we know HEFCE and\n          government are well aware of and the introduction of part-time maintenance loans and further\n          relaxation of the ELQ policy should have a positive impact on this from 2018/19. We continue to\n          lobby to improve the support for part time students.                    \n                                                                                  \n          The White Paper, Success as a knowledge economy: teaching excellence, social mobility and\n          student choice and the 2016 Higher Education and Research Bill will inevitably have\n          consequences for the College. The introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF)\n          metrics may have unintentional consequences for us due to our unique mode of evening\n          teaching and we will robustly lobby where appropriate.                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 9",

In our third century we will continue to offer\n          transforming educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial,\n          practical or otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will maintain and develop our\n          distinctive research culture and contribution to science and society and we will create more and\n          better space and facilities for all of our activities.                  \n                                                                                  \n          Awards                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research\n          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that\n          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various\n          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards received during\n          the year.                                                               \n          Professor of Psychology, Martin Eimer, was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in recognition\n          of his outstanding contribution to research. He was one of only 42 academics to be elected for\n          the fellowship this year. Professor Eimer leads the Brain and Behaviour Lab at the Department\n          for Psychological Sciences, where he and his team investigate the cognitive and neural\n          mechanisms of visual attention and working memory, and study face perception and recognition\n          and their impairment in prosopagnosia (face blindness). In REF 2014, 60% of the Department's\n          work was rated in the highest category 4*, defined as ‘world-leading in terms of originality,\n          significance and rigour’.                                               \n                                                                                  \n          Professor Nikolaus Wachsmann of the Department of History, Classics and Archaeology, was\n          awarded the Wolfson History Prize for his book on the history of Nazi concentration camps.\n          Established in 1972 the £30,000 Wolfson History Prize recognises scholarly works which\n          enhance public understanding of history and encourages historians to write for a wider audience\n          than academia. As well as his role as Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck,\n          Professor Wachsmann is also a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.   \n                                                                                  \n          The Royal Society of Chemistry Anne Bennett Memorial Award for Distinguished Service was\n          awarded to Birkbeck chemist Professor Michael Thompson for “his outstanding contribution to\n          the development and recognition of the work of the Analytical Division and its Analytical Methods\n          Committee”. The award recognises exceptional voluntary services to the Royal Society of\n          Chemistry Analytical Division - typically at least ten years. Professor Thompson’s research\n          involves assessing and improving the quality of analytical data, the performance of the\n          laboratories producing them, and the development of statistical models and procedures to\n          support these activities. The Royal Society was founded in 1841 by a group of academics,\n          industrialists and doctors.                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 10",

Dr Suzanne O’Sullivan, who completed an MA Creative\n          Writing programme in November 2015, won the annual award which recognises excellence in\n          new works of fiction or non-fiction that are based around some aspect of medicine, health or\n          illness. “It's All in Your Head: True Stories of Imaginary Illness” is her first book and explores her\n          experiences as a neurology consultant and the encounters she has had with patients who have\n          debilitating but medically unexplained illnesses. Dr O’Sullivan claimed her experience of Birkbeck\n          “is one I will never forget. I was exposed to ways of thinking about reading and writing that I had\n          never thought about before. There is no doubt that I can view my own writing more critically now,\n          but without a sense that my individuality or creativity has been stymied.”\n          Two alumni of Birkbeck, as well as the College’s Chair of Governors, were recognised in the\n          Queen’s New Year honours list. Harvey McGrath, Chair of Governors, was awarded a knighthood\n          for services to economic growth and public life. With a long and distinguished career in business,\n          having served as Chair of both the Man Group and Prudential, he has promoted philanthropy\n          across London for many years, including serving as the Chairman of Big Society Capital.\n                                                                                  \n          Fellow of the College and former Liberal Democrat MP for Kingston and Surbiton Ed Davey was\n          also awarded a knighthood for political and public service. Sir Ed studied a Master’s degree in\n          Economics at Birkbeck and latterly served in the last Government as Secretary of State for\n          Energy and Climate Change.                                              \n                                                                                  \n          Finally, Daniel Peltz, was awarded an OBE for services to charity and philanthropy. Daniel funded\n          the restoration of the Peltz Gallery in Birkbeck’s School of Arts, a space which has become a\n          flexible exhibition space enabling creative activities to happen at the heart of the School.\n                                                                                  \n          Teaching excellence                                                     \n          We are committed not only to teaching excellence, but to the innovative organization and flexible\n          delivery of our teaching in ways that genuinely respond to the needs of our students. Teaching\n          activity is absolutely critical both in terms of mission and financial stability. Student fee income in\n          2015/16 constituted nearly 63% of our total income compared to 18% for funding council\n          grants, 9% for research grants and 8% for other income.                 \n                                                                                  \n          To improve the student experience we are developing an estates strategy which aims to improve\n          the quality of teaching and ancillary space and co-locate student activity on our main campus in\n          Torrington Square. It is now a strategic objective that by our 200th anniversary in 2023 all\n          Birkbeck students will be studying either in fully owned Birkbeck facilities or in facilities shared\n          with other HE institutions.                                             \n                                                                                  \n          Our strategy for ensuring the quality of our teaching is heavily linked to our research activity. We\n          submitted 83% of eligible staff to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) with\n          approximately three-quarters of their research being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or\n          ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). Unlike many universities our research intensive staff also\n          undertake teaching.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 11",

It means that all our academic staff members also carry out research so that even\n          when they are not teaching directly on their own specialist topics, their academic understanding\n          is rooted in their practice as researchers and scholars. It also means that where opportunities\n          arise, students can benefit from direct contact with, and teaching by, individuals who are\n          engaged with research in the topic areas of interest, and it means that the curriculum is heavily\n          influenced by our academics’ up-to-date understanding of changing research agendas, advances\n          in knowledge, and contemporary methodological challenges.               \n          Whilst the College is committed to providing research leave and to encouraging academics to\n          gain research grants that allow them time away from teaching in order to pursue a research\n          project, and whilst it is also the case that some levels and areas of teaching are best delivered by\n          specialist Teaching and Scholarship staff, these factors are balanced against the additional\n          principle that there should be no separation of the academic community into ‘research’ and\n          ‘teaching’ groups.”                                                     \n                                                                                  \n          Although league tables do not always factor in the implications of our unique evening delivery of\n          teaching, it is nevertheless reassuring to note that the College maintained its position in the top\n          1% of universities worldwide in the Times Higher Education (THE) league table. We were ranked\n          in the 201-250 category compared to 226-250 in 2015. The THE also ranked Birkbeck as the\n          50th most international university in the world in a ranking based on the diversity of the student\n          body, the proportion of international staff and the level of international academic collaboration.\n                                                                                  \n          Our work in the Arts and Humanities area (which includes activity in two of our Schools) was\n          ranked 52nd in the world in the THE league table emphasizing the world-leading nature of this\n          area of activity. This allows us to recruit both senior and junior academics of very high quality who\n          in turn contribute to the standard of our teaching and research.        \n          In the 2016 National Student Survey (NSS) the College was rated number one in the country for\n          overall course satisfaction in five subject areas: Archaeology; Classics; Finance; Geology; and\n          Linguistics. Economics and English were rated top in London for overall satisfaction. In general,\n          91% of our students in their final year have found their course ‘intellectually stimulating’, with 87\n          per cent satisfied with their experience of the College more broadly. 61 per cent of final year\n          students completed the Survey with detailed feedback used by the College to continually improve\n          the student experience.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          We are preparing to engage with the second round of reporting under the proposed Teaching\n          Excellence Framework (TEF). Taking part in the exercise will allow us to benchmark our\n          performance against the sector and will provide information to enable us to understand our\n          strengths and weaknesses. Anticipated metrics are being considered in detail by the College to\n          identify areas for improvement. There are, however, two significant elements in the construction\n          of the TEF metrics which disadvantage Birkbeck which we have made clear in our response to\n          the technical consultation and in lobbying work:                        \n                                                                                  \n          •    the denominator in the proportion of students in employment or further study includes\n               graduates who are not available for work eg pensioners and full time carers. This is a\n               change to the way the Destination of Leavers outcomes are usually reported;\n                                                                                  \n          •    the “London effect” is not considered in benchmarking for NSS results (where London\n               institutions tend to get lower scores due to location).            \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 12",

In this area, we achieved a notable\n          success when the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) found that the proportion of\n          Birkbeck students in employment or further study six months after graduation was significantly\n          higher than other institutions nationally when benchmarked against characteristics such as entry\n          qualification. Moreover, Birkbeck also appears amongst the highest ranking institutions in sector-\n          wide metrics on graduate earnings.                                      \n          Obviously, part of this success is due to the fact that a number of students are in employment\n          when they arrive at the College and continue to remain in such employment. Nonetheless, we\n          recognize that many of our students study in order to gain their first job or a new position. For this\n          reason, we have established “Birkbeck Talent”: an Employment Agency which assists students to\n          find work or paid internships. In its pilot year 350 students attended interviews with 143 being\n          placed in jobs or paid internships. On the back of these accomplishments, the scheme was\n          expanded further and opened up to the entire student body from February 2016.\n                                                                                  \n          The Birkbeck Talent initiative is one part of our careers and employment activity which also\n          involves an in-house service for enhancing career development and employability of our\n          students, as well as a work readiness programme sponsored by the J.P. Morgan Foundation. This\n          involves a series of events and workshops equipping students with the skills, confidence and\n          experience needed for successful career progression.                    \n                                                                                  \n          These activities involving enhancing the career prospects of our students are evidently central to\n          the mission of Birkbeck. They also provide us with the basis to participate actively in the\n          development of the Apprenticeships Programme which is currently being strongly promoted by\n          Government. The Apprenticeship Programme we are developing will build on our experience in\n          working with business and their employees as well as providing opportunities for employees in\n          London to gain degree level qualifications. This could involve standard degree programmes,\n          perhaps modified to include a project at the place of work or the development of bespoke\n          apprenticeship/degree programmes for groups of employers in a particular area.\n          We continue to operate robust systems and structures to ensure that high quality teaching is\n          maintained and improved. We have recruited a full time Pro-Vice-Master for Learning and\n          Teaching to oversee and further develop our teaching strategy. She will be supported by\n          academic leads in each of the five Schools to implement and monitor action plans.\n                                                                                  \n          Teaching and Quality Enhancement Committee oversees the Strategy for Learning and Teaching\n          and the operation of academic quality assurance mechanisms including responses to student\n          feedback, overview of academic regulations, annual programme review, five year departmental\n          review and external examiner procedures.                                \n                                                                                  \n          Ensuring that we maintain our high levels of teaching based on the international reputation of our\n          research staff is an integral part of our business.

Approximately three-quarters of the\n          research submitted by the College was rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally\n          excellent’ (3*). This represents a considerable improvement on the results of the 2008 Research\n          Assessment Exercise (RAE) when 56% of our research was rated 4* or 3*, paralleling the\n          considerable improvement overall in the sector.                         \n                                                                                  \n          We are committed to the implementation of the principles laid down in the Concordat to Support\n          the Career Development of Researchers. The Concordat offers a set of principles for the support\n          and management of research careers and, under each principle, an explanation of how it may\n          best be embedded into institutional practice. We adhere to the Concordat as a way to maintain\n          the excellence of our research environment and to support the development of researchers. Most\n          of what we do is already in line with the recommendations of the Concordat, but we shall be\n          formalising this through integrating the recommendations into an updated College Research\n          Strategy and developing an Action Plan to encourage improvements in our working practices.\n          Building on this we are preparing a submission for the HR Excellence in Research Award.\n                                                                                  \n          The College Research Strategy 2014-19 articulates the way we wish to set about achieving our\n          research aims. It is overseen by a Pro-Vice-Master for Research supported by Assistant Deans in\n          each of the Five Schools. There is a research strategy group working in parallel with a research\n          support group implementing the aims of the Strategy. This includes providing support for\n          researchers at all levels, encouraging collaborative activity and partnerships, and offering\n          opportunities for research students including doctoral training partnerships with other\n          institutions. We are preparing for the upcoming REF informed by the report from the Stern review\n          and aiming to at least maintain our 2014 position.                      \n          In terms of the financial support for research, it is pleasing to report that despite an increasingly\n          competitive environment for project-based research funding, the College’s research income for\n          the year remained relatively stable at £10.1 million in 2015/16 (2014/15: £10.3 million).\n                                                                                  \n          Our success in driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit\n          criteria outlined in the Charities Act. Some of the grants which were awarded or completed this\n          year are summarised in the Public Benefit Statement starting on page 27.\n                                                                                  \n          The excellence of our staff and their research successes were responsible for our continuing\n          good position in University League Tables. We were positioned 280th in the 2016 QS World\n          University Rankings (up from 431st in 2014 and 290th in 2015). The ranking evaluated more than\n          4,200 universities worldwide in 42 subject areas. Moreover, for research the College was ranked\n          12th in the UK for citations per faculty (16th 2015).                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 14",

The\n          Department of Psychological Sciences high position in the global rankings followed from its\n          strong performance in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) where it was rated 5th in\n          the UK. The College also scored 8th in the world in terms of its percentage of total publications\n          that are among the 10% most highly cited papers.

Some of the space is not of the high standard that we\n          would like to offer our students and in some cases operational challenges have been\n          experienced. It is now a strategic objective that by our 200th Anniversary in 2023 all Birkbeck\n          students will be studying either in fully owned facilities or in property shared with other higher\n          education institutions.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n          Having achieved revenue surpluses for a number of years we were able to purchase a building\n          called Cambridge House on the Euston Road during 2014/15. A range of options including using\n          the building for research, teaching or office space have been considered. A design team are\n          currently engaged in drawing up plans ranging from simple refurbishment to demolition and\n          construction of a larger building. Either directly, or indirectly through moving staff from existing\n          accommodation, the development work will increase the teaching space owned by the College.\n          It is of vital importance that we provide the very best facilities for our research as well as\n          ensuring that high quality teaching facilities are provided for students. During 2015/16 we\n          completed work to upgrade laboratory and associated space for our Earth Sciences department.\n          The £1.3 million project was half funded by a capital grant from HEFCE. \n                                                                                  \n          We have been planning the development of a new building to house a Toddler Laboratory for the\n          Department of Psychological Sciences, building on the great success of the Baby Laboratory in\n          terms of identifying early markers of autism, potentially allowing much earlier interventions\n          before the onset of the symptoms. Following the receipt of major donations from the Wohl\n          Foundation (£1.3 million) and the Wolfson Foundation (£800,000), Governors made the decision\n          to proceed with this project. Unfortunately, progress was delayed whilst the University of London\n          negotiated with the neighbouring Warburg Institute to gain their approval for the proposed\n          scheme since the University would not grant us the site without such approval. A lease has now\n          been agreed for the land.                                               \n                                                                                  \n          Before commencing the next phase of development for this £5.0 - £7.0 million project, we are\n          negotiating an extended lease with the University for the property at 32 Torrington Square which\n          will abut the new Toddlerlab. Once this is complete we can also develop plans to refurbish this\n          building for use by research staff who are currently housed in rented accommodation nearby.\n                                                                                  \n          In July 2016 we completed the sale of a long leasehold property which was surplus to College\n          requirements. The sale price of £5.2 million was confirmed as a good price by external\n          consultants. The funds received will contribute to the construction costs of the projects\n          mentioned above.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 15",

It is assumed that the extension building will\n          be replaced and funding will not be needed in the short term. Significant remedial works will be\n          required if we choose to delay the extension building project. Major works are needed in the main\n          building such as replacing the roof and windows.

The\n          EcoCampus initiative was initially set up and funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for\n          England in 2005 and is now a collaborative project between Nottingham Trent University and\n          Loreus Ltd, an EMS software development & training consultancy.         \n          Set up specifically for institutions in higher education, around 30% of the sector is enrolled on the\n          scheme. The phased approach means that universities gain recognition for improved\n          environmental performance through a series of awards; Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.\n          Platinum is the highest award and is equivalent to the ISO 14001:2015 EMS Standard. The\n          certification not only recognises the current progress with our environment programme but also\n          acknowledges the structures we have in place upon which further improvements can be made in\n          the coming years. A schedule of carbon reduction measures is developed each year with a view\n          to reducing our carbon emissions by at least 25% by the 2020/21 academic year against a\n          2013/14 baseline.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 16",

They are a\n          vital part of Birkbeck’s past, present and future. Alongside our corporate partners, charitable\n          trusts and foundations our alumni contributed towards the £1.8 million raised in philanthropic\n          donations during the 2015/16 financial year. These donations ranged from regular monthly\n          donations to several six-figure gifts and contributed towards funding for undergraduate and\n          postgraduate bursaries, academic research, staff posts, employability work, the re-development\n          of the new Library Study Space and supporting students with disabilities.\n          Alumni were also involved in volunteering their time to aid recruitment, retention and\n          employability strategies across the College. There are a number of programmes that alumni can\n          get involved in at varying levels of commitment, with opportunities lasting for an hour right\n          through to six-month long mentoring programmes. Over 300 alumni volunteered at Birkbeck, an\n          increase of over 75% year-on-year. This resulted in 2,947 volunteer hours being donated, double\n          last year’s figure.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          In July 2016 we received the very sad news that our Deputy Chair of Governors, Dr Ruth\n          Thompson, had died of cancer. Ruth was appointed as an independent Governor in 2009 after\n          she retired as Director-General for Higher Education in the Department for Innovation,\n          Universities and Skills. A career civil servant, she also worked in senior roles in the Department of\n          Trade and Industry, HM Treasury and the Department of Social Security. She was a member of\n          the Higher Education Policy Institute and in 2014 co-chaired an inquiry for the Higher Education\n          Commission on the future financial sustainability of Higher Education. At Birkbeck, Ruth was a\n          member of the Finance and General Purposes Committee and the Remuneration Committee and\n          took on the Deputy Chair role in 2014. She led the Review of Governor Effectiveness in 2013 and\n          co-chaired the Review of the Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics in 2015.\n          Ruth made an enormous contribution to Birkbeck in her time as a Governor, combining her\n          tremendous intelligence and analytical skills with good humour.         \n          2015/16 was another very successful year for the College, both financially and academically. We\n          are continuing with the academic and student support developments that are essential to\n          creating the best possible environment for our students and we are developing a strategy for\n          investment in the College estate, something which is essential for the long term sustainability\n          and development of our teaching and research. On the back of a very strong performance in the\n          2014 REF we will implement our updated strategy for excellent and distinctive research.\n          Although there are a number of significant uncertainties in the higher education sector at the\n          moment we are confidently defining our ambitions and vision for Birkbeck in 2023, when the\n          College will celebrate its 200th anniversary.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Professor David S.

A new Statement of Recommended Practice\n          (SORP) based on this standard has been developed for Further and Higher Education. Financial\n          year 2015/16 is the first set of financial statements that the College needs to prepare under the\n          new SORP. To enable comparison of financial performance from one year to the next, the\n          statements for 2014/15 have been restated under the new standard.       \n                                                                                  \n          During the early part of 2015, we commissioned a review of the implications of conversion to the\n          new accounting standard from our external auditor, KPMG. They undertook a gap analysis of the\n          likely areas requiring review and identified them as: government grants; non-exchange\n          transactions; componentisation of fixed assets; revaluation of land and buildings; employee\n          benefits – annual leave accrual; and pensions. We do not have exposure to other aspects of the\n          new SORP such as joint ventures and service concessions.                \n                                                                                  \n          Where options in accounting policy were available the College agreed the following:\n                                                                                  \n              Government grants (revenue and capital) – accruals basis. This is the same treatment as\n               required under UK GAAP and matches annual income with expenditure; \n                                                                                  \n              Land and buildings have not been revalued. However, an external valuation was obtained\n               in order to componentise the assets. The assets were split in line with the valuation\n               report but pro-rated to the original balance sheet cost. The valuation report assessed the\n               remaining useful life of the building element and the revised lives (which were in general\n               longer than the estimates we had been using) were used to calculate depreciation. The\n               net effect of revising the lives of the individual buildings was to reduce depreciation.\n          We also introduced a new asset category for heritage assets to record various donated works of\n          art. The estimated value for these assets is £0.4 million. The donations had previously not been\n          recorded as having value to the College. The asset class will not be depreciated.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 18",

Under the new SORP, the element associated with\n          changes to the pension liability in the Balance Sheet will have a direct impact on the surplus.\n                                                                                  \n          Table 3 summarises the main adjustments which have been made to restate the Balance Sheet\n          at 31 July 2015:                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                             Audited Pension Endowments Capital Other Restated    \n                            2014/15    £m        £m    grants  £m  2014/15        \n                                £m                       £m            £m         \n          Fixed assets         79.8              3.8           3.5    87.1        \n          Endowment assets     5.6              (5.6)                   -         \n          Current assets       53.4              1.8                  55.2        \n          Creditors           (22.2) (13.0)            (33.6) (1.5)  (70.3)       \n                                                                                  \n          Total net assets    116.6  (13.0)        -   (33.6)  2.0    72.0        \n                                                                                  \n          Deferred capital grants 43.0                 (43.0)           -         \n          Endowments           5.6              (5.6)                   -         \n          Reserves             68.0  (13.0)      5.6     9.4   2.0    72.0        \n                                                                                  \n          Total reserves      116.6  (13.0)        -   (31.8)  2.0    72.0        \n          Table 3: Restated Balance Sheet 31 July 2015                            \n          The College contributes to two pension schemes: Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and\n          the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL).

Teaching grant fell by a further £1.0 million in 2015/16 (a\n          reduction of 11.2%) following on from the £2.0 million reduction in 2014/15. HEFCE teaching\n          grant now represents only 7% of College income in comparison with 47.5% ten years ago. Income\n          from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/6 to 58.6% in 2015/16.  \n          Part-time student recruitment remains challenging for the sector and it is hoped that the\n          introduction of maintenance loan funding for part time undergraduate students in 2018/19 will\n          help to arrest the decline. Income from full time Home and EU students increased by £4.8 million\n          (22.2%) primarily as a result of the continuing flow through of higher fee paying cohorts of\n          students following the introduction of 3 year undergraduate programmes from 2012. The new\n          postgraduate student loan of £10,000 which became available from 2016/17 has led to a\n          significant increase in both full time and part time postgraduate taught enrolments (an increase\n          of over 50% in full time and nearly 20% in part time numbers compared with 2015/16).\n          Other income has remained broadly similar over the last two years with the exception of a profit\n          from sale of fixed asset of £3.2 million in 2015/16.                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 21",

The creation of a pension deficit recovery plan in 2014/15\n          depressed the underlying financial performance whilst the sale of property and gain on\n          endowments increased the surplus in 2015/16. The College previously targeted a surplus of 5%\n          of turnover but the volatility in total comprehensive income requires us to reconsider this metric.\n          What is clear from Table 5 is that the College is generating consistent levels of cash from\n          operating activities – around 10% of total income. Our strategy to return surpluses of 5% of\n          income was primarily introduced to ensure that we generated cash to invest in our future. The\n          rationale remains the same albeit that we may want to shift our focus to cash directly (rather\n          than indirectly) as a less volatile indicator of performance.           \n                                                                                  \n          Strong financial management has kept costs in line with budget. Staff costs as a percentage of\n          total income rose in 2015/16 due to the increases in pension and National Insurance\n          contributions but this increase was in line with expectations. As a research intensive institution\n          based in London with no additional income from student residences, the College recognises the\n          added importance of managing this metric and has a current target of not exceeding 60%.\n                                                                                  \n          Despite the reduction in net assets the College is in a sound financial position with a strong base\n          for the future.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \n          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of\n          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach\n          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,\n          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to\n          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk\n          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on\n          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  \n          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to\n          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit\n          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key\n          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main\n          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        \n                                                                                  \n          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and\n          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and\n          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,\n          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The\n          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual\n          report on internal control and risk for 2015/16 was presented to the Audit Committee in May\n          2016.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College introduced a new scoring system for the risk register in 2015/16. We have now\n          assessed and scored risks using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores\n          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account\n          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),\n          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk which can be achieved\n          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 24",

In 2015 an\n               objective was agreed to return surpluses of 5-7% for the next five years. A recruitment\n               cycle that was worse than expected meant that student recruitment and income targets\n               for 2015/16 were not met. In-year budget adjustments were made which led to the\n               budget surplus for the year being exceeded but the College will need to take action to\n               recover the income lost through lower recruitment of undergraduate students in\n               2015/16. A staged return to sustainable surpluses above 5% of income is currently\n               planned from 2016/17 onwards.                                      \n               The dimensions of the financial sustainability risk include the potential inability to\n               maintain income, which is linked with the student recruitment risk; inability to control\n               staff costs; and inability to control non-staff costs. While the risk is well managed through\n               financial planning, improved budget reporting and income and debt management, which\n               has allowed prompt action to be taken this year to maintain the target surplus, the\n               uncertainty around student recruitment and income and the challenge of ensuring target\n               surpluses in future means that financial sustainability remains a top risk, with an overall\n               increased score for 2016/17 of 20.25 gross, 16 net.                \n                                                                                  \n              Estates strategy                                                   \n                                                                                  \n               The score for the estates strategy risk has increased from 12 gross and 10.5 net to 16\n               gross and 14 net, recognising the importance for the College of implementing an effective\n               estates strategy to fulfil its student and research related aims.  \n                                                                                  \n               The College continues to have significant space requirements for teaching students,\n               research and other activities. The University of London are developing their estates\n               strategy, and taking an increasingly commercial approach to use of the University estate,\n               which may impact our ability to secure space in the vicinity of the Malet Street campus.\n               Estates Committee meets each term to monitor the progress of projects and reports to\n               Finance & General Purposes Committee.                              \n              Student experience                                                 \n                                                                                  \n               An inability to meet the needs of students and delivery of an optimal student experience\n               could potentially impact both recruitment and retention, result in lower National Student\n               Survey scores with a consequent impact on both reputation and recruitment, and lead to\n               students having an unsatisfactory university experience and not reaching their full\n               potential. A student services strategy to address and alleviate these risks has been\n               approved by College management and considered by Governors, and is being\n               implemented.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n               A National Student Survey taskforce has been set up to consider the results of the NSS,\n               identify areas of student satisfaction which need to be addressed, and make students\n               aware of action that has been taken in response to their feedback.

In addition, external budget\n               cuts in other organisations, such as the cuts to the Disabled Students Allowance, will\n               increase the range of services that the College will need to provide. The net score for this\n               risk is, therefore, maintained at 12 for 2016/17.                  \n              Student recruitment                                                \n                                                                                  \n               2015/16 was the first year that institutions were competing without student number\n               controls for undergraduate students. The impact of this competition on recruitment was\n               much greater than anticipated, and student number and income targets for 2016/17\n               were revised mid-year. The introduction of postgraduate loans in 2016/17 has led to an\n               increase in recruitment but it is too early to determine whether this is a long term change\n               or previous student demand now being fulfilled due to the availability of funding. The\n               College has strengthened its recruitment management and monitoring arrangements in\n               response to this challenge, setting up a Recruitment Strategy and Planning Group.

In addition to\n               additional marketing resource and recruitment process improvements, Birkbeck is\n               considering how to expand and develop the existing academic portfolio to attract new\n               students.

The Governing Body has\n          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in\n          the following manner.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n          The College aims to provide higher education opportunities to people who would not otherwise\n          have access, continuing the mission since its inception. The College’s founder, George Birkbeck,\n          had a vision of the power of education to transform and improve lives, and this founding\n          commitment to social change and widening access is a core strand of what still drives the\n          College today. The College’s mission includes “enabling students from diverse social and\n          educational backgrounds to participate”. As London’s only specialist provider of flexible evening\n          higher education, Birkbeck has long encouraged applications from students without traditional\n          qualifications or from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. \n                                                                                  \n          We attract a very high proportion of students with low incomes. The most recent monitoring\n          return to the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) for 2014/15 indicated that 47% of our full time\n          undergraduate students were from households with an income of under £25,000 and 39% of\n          part time students. These students received a Birkbeck bursary to support their study. The\n          ethnicity of our students demonstrates that we are attracting a very diverse student body, with\n          57% of our full-time undergraduate students from BME backgrounds (2014/15: 59%). 15% of\n          our students (19% of our full time undergraduates) declared that they had a disability (2014/15:\n          14%; 19% full time undergraduate).                                      \n                                                                                  \n          To ensure that finance is not a barrier to study we support government funding arrangements by\n          providing our own bursaries and scholarships to students experiencing financial hardship. In\n          addition, a number of scholarships are provided through donations from our alumni and friends.\n          We also offer self-financing students the option to pay for their tuition fees in interest free\n          monthly instalments over the academic year.                             \n          As well as the expenditure on financial support, we spend considerable amounts on ensuring that\n          our students are successful while they are with us, and that they are well placed in the jobs\n          market on graduation. Our evening provision uniquely enables students to combine study in the\n          evening with meaningful work during the day. In order to support students to gain paid and\n          relevant job placements we have invested in our capacity to provide a particular type of careers\n          support and a new service to create job brokerage called Birkbeck Talent.\n                                                                                  \n          We will continue to invest significantly in activities which support student access, progression,\n          success and employability.                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 27",

Treatment of the disease involves a harsh course of antibiotics over a\n          period of many months. The urgent need for new, shorter, therapeutic regimens and new classes\n          of drugs active against drug-resistant bugs drove a countrywide collaboration among researchers\n          who specialise in chemical synthesis and molecular microbiology to develop potential anti-TB\n          drugs. This inter-disciplinary effort identified a number of promising drug candidates that may be\n          able to tackle the increasing antibiotic resistance of TB strains.      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 28",

In 2016, Dr Julia Laite from the Department of History,\n          Classics and Archaeology secured support from the AHRC to fund a £250,000 project to study\n          the history of illicit and clandestine migration by examining trafficking in the nineteenth and\n          twentieth centuries. The research will elaborate a global history of trafficking at a time when\n          historical perspective is needed to improve understanding of the phenomenon in the present\n          day. It will examine trafficking in the context of the history of international crime and wider\n          migration control asking how trafficking policy relates to migration control more broadly and how\n          it has influenced the development of migration law and enforcement. The research will explore\n          the connections between gender, sex, labour, and illicit migration, both in terms of law and policy,\n          but also in terms of individual experiences in the past.                \n          The relief of those in need, by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or\n          other disadvantage                                                      \n                                                                                  \n          Professor Mark Johnson and his team have secured funds from the MQ Foundation and Action\n          Medical Research to support their ongoing research into vulnerable groups of infants. New\n          projects worth £500,000 and £200,000 will consider “Attention control training in infants at risk\n          of ADHD” and “Identifying neurocognitive treatment targets in infants with Neurofibromatosis\n          Type 1”. The research team also contributed to the recent report in the Lancet that parent-\n          mediated interventions can significantly improve outcomes for infants at high risk of autism.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 29",

There is a\n          majority of lay members and the roles of Chair and Deputy Chair of the Governing Body are\n          separate from the role of the College’s Chief Executive, the Master.    \n                                                                                  \n          The matters specially reserved to the Governors for decision are set out in the Charter and\n          Statutes of the College and the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities and under the\n          Memorandum of Assurance and Accountability with the Higher Education Funding Council for\n          England.

Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to\n          achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance\n          against material misstatement or loss.                                  \n                                                                                  \n          The Governing Body met four times during the year and has several committees, including\n          Finance and General Purposes Committee, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and\n          Remuneration Committee.

All reviews undertaken by\n          internal audit are considered with the management in the relevant operational unit. The reviews\n          are also considered by the Master, College Secretary and Director of Finance and appropriate\n          action confirmed to the Audit Committee.

To the\n          fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than\n          the Governing Body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n          Respective responsibilities of the Governing Body and auditor           \n                                                                                  \n          As explained more fully in the Statement of the College Governors’ Responsibilities set out on\n          page 30 and 31 the Governing Body is responsible for the preparation of financial statements\n          which give a true and fair view.                                        \n          Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion, on the financial statements in accordance\n          with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards\n          require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.\n          Scope of the audit of the financial statements                          \n                                                                                  \n          An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial\n          statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from\n          material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:\n          whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and University’s circumstances\n          and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant\n          accounting estimates made by the Governing Body; and the overall presentation of the financial\n          statements.                                                             \n          In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Operating and Financial\n          Review to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify\n          any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,\n          the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any\n          apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.\n          Opinion on financial statements                                         \n                                                                                  \n          In our opinion the financial statements:                                \n                                                                                  \n              give a true and fair view of the state of the Group and the College affairs as at 31 July\n               2016, of the Group and College income and expenditure, gains and losses and changes\n               in reserves and of the Group’s cash flows for the year then ended; \n                                                                                  \n              have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted\n               Accounting Practice and with the 2015 Statement of Recommended Practice –\n               Accounting for Further and Higher Education; and                   \n                                                                                  \n              meet the requirements of HEFCE’s Accounts direction to higher education institutions for\n               2015/16 financial statements.                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                      Page 36",

Under\n             defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former\n             employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that\n             returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by\n             the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of\n             plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that\n             employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine\n             its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets.

Any unused benefits are accrued\n             and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.\n                                                                                  \n       6.

Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the\n             corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value\n             and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.\n                                                                                  \n             Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the\n             outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce\n             a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 45",

Due to the nature of our business and the\n           composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations)\n           it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of\n           staff may have an interest. All transactions are conducted at arms length in accordance with the financial\n           regulations of the College.

From 1 April 2016 defined benefit schemes could no longer opt out of the S2P.\n           A defined contribution section was introduced in October 2016. The fund is independently administered by\n           trustees. Due to the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not hypothecated to individual institutions\n           and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The College is, therefore, exposed to actuarial risks associated\n           with the employees of other institutions and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and\n           liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Consequently, and as required by Section 28\n           of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the College accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution\n           scheme.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of\n           a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme\n           is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such\n           as that provided by USS. The members of USS have entered into an agreement with the scheme trustees\n           which determines how they will fund the net pension deficit in the scheme. The accounting principles\n           pertaining to multi-employer schemes require the College to recognise the contributions payable that arise\n           from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The\n           resulting expense is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure. College governors\n           are satisfied that the scheme provided by USS meets the definition of a multi-employer scheme and have,\n           therefore, recognised as a liability the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under the\n           funding plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                       Page 65",

The\n                                                                                  \n           valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.

The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to have sufficient and appropriate\n           assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the scheme was\n           £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion. This results in a net\n           shortfall of £5.3 billion. The assets, therefore, were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had\n           accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.\n                                                                                  \n           The defined benefit liability for the scheme has been produced using the following assumptions:\n                                                                                  \n                                                  2016          2015              \n                                                                                  \n           Discount rate                          3.6%          3.3%              \n                                                          3.5% in the first       \n                                                           year and 4.0%          \n           Pensionable salary growth               n/a        thereafter          \n                                                                                  \n           Pension increases                      2.2%          2.2%              \n                                                                                  \n           Mortality in retirement is assumed to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S1NA\n           tables as follows:                                                     \n                                                                                  \n           Male members’ mortality: 98% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – no age rating\n           Female members’ mortality: 99% of S1NA [“light”] YoB tables – rated down 1 year\n                                                                                  \n           Use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience.
