AUPS is now a closed scheme to new entrants and future accrual and all                                 \n   existing members now have deferred benefits.                                                                                                                     \n   AUPS is a defined benefit scheme which was externally funded and for the period up to 5 April 2016 was contracted out of the State                               \n   Second Pension (S2P). From 6 April 2016, contracting out ceased with the introduction of the Government’s new state pension. The fund is                         \n   valued every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries. The last formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31                     \n   March 2022.                                                                                                                                                      \n   USS is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the                        \n   scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not attributed to                            \n   individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with                      \n   other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and                     \n   reasonable basis. As required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were                      \n   a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the                        \n   scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will                         \n   fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that                 \n   they relate to the deficit) with related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account. Under the 2023 valuation the scheme                      \n   was assessed as being in surplus on a technical provisions basis and consequently no deficit recovery plan was deemed required. The                              \n   institution was no longer required to make deficit recovery contributions from 1 January 2024 and accordingly released the outstanding                           \n   provision to the profit and loss account.                                                                                                                        \n   SWPS is a defined contribution plan, a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed contributions into a separate                          \n   entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension                         \n   plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the year during which services are rendered by employees.                                          \n   50          Aston University                                 Financial Statements 2023/24 Financial Statements 2023/24                    Aston University   51",
