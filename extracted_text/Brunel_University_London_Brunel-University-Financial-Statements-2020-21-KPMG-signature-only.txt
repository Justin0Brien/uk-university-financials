This decrease was driven principally by the reduction in other income as a result of lower residency income (down £13.3m
from 2019/20). Other income consists of student residences income, conference, hotel, retail and also income from summer
school activity for foreign language students on the campus. All categories were significantly impacted by the pandemic,
including the decision by the University not to charge rent for accommodation during the period when government
guidance did not permit students to return to university after the Christmas break and allowing students to be released from
their accommodation agreements for the final term of the year.
Tuition fee income increased by £17.0m to £155.1m reflecting the increase in student numbers.
Research grant income for 2020/21 was £5.2m lower than in 2019/20 on a recognised income basis. Research income
reflects the timing of work undertaken on research grants, as income is recognised in the financial statements over a period
typically averaging three years. The decline reflects reduced research activity in the year due to the restrictions imposed by
the pandemic.
Tuition fee income increased by £17.0m to £155.1m
reflecting the increase in student numbers.
Expenditure
Excluding the non-recurring items detailed in the Operating Results paragraphs above, expenditure was £8.3m (3.5%) higher
than in 2019/20. Expenditure before non-recurring items included £1.4m of Covid-related costs (£0.2m in 2019/20).
As in previous years, the majority of expenditure (54.9%) related to staff costs. Staff costs are impacted by the movement
in the pension provisions. Excluding pension adjustments, staff costs of £140.9m were £5.0m (4.0%) higher than in 2019/20
as a result of general staff inflation and the continued investment in academic provision in areas which have seen increased
tuition fee income and student numbers.
Other operating expenditure of £81.2m (excluding impairment adjustments) has increased by £4.3m (5.5%) reflecting
inflationary cost increases. Depreciation costs are marginally lower than 2019/20, offsetting the increased costs
described above.

In 2020/21 Brunel Volunteers worked with 24 external
organisations which enabled 477 students to complete

Due to the pandemic, the department was limited in
its ability to assist with key community volunteering
activities in Hillingdon and beyond. Volunteering was
largely restricted to individual remote roles supporting
organisations such as Pield Heath House School, The

Age UK and The Otermans Institute.
Despite the cancellation of numerous on-campus

supports the achievement of policies, aims and objectives,
whilst safeguarding the public and other funds and
assets for which it is responsible, in accordance with the
responsibility assigned to the Council in the Charter and
Statutes. Such a system is designed to manage, rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business,
operational, compliance and financial objectives, and it
can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance of effectiveness.
The system of internal control is based on an ongoing
process designed to identify the principal risks to the
achievement of policies, aims and objectives, to evaluate
the nature and extent of those risks, and to manage them
efficiently, effectively and economically.
The University benefits from the use of both external and
internal audit functions with regard to the internal control
environment. They perform different, complementary
roles within the assurance framework and both are
essential for the effective governance of the University.
They report separately to the Audit Committee as well
as to the University’s Council. The external audit process
helps to ensure that the internal controls, processes,
guidelines and policies are adequate, effective and
in compliance with regulatory requirements, and also
ensures that reporting mechanisms prevent errors in
financial statements. The internal audit function provides
Council members and the Executive Board with assurance
over the internal control environment that they can use to
fulfil their own duties. Internal audit provides an objective
and independent assurance, providing reasonable
(not absolute) assurance of the overall effectiveness
of governance, risk management and controls. Both
functions assist the University to manage its resources
efficiently, effectively and economically, and therefore to
deliver value for money.
Despite the need to preserve their independence and
objectivity, internal and external audit should maintain
a close, constructive relationship. This is to ensure their
work is coordinated and there is an efficient use of
resources.
The Council has adopted a risk management policy,
and has identified where the principal management
responsibility rests for risk management. The Council
is of the view that an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the University’s significant risks
has been in place, and operating effectively, since 31 July
2003.

interest. Debt instruments are subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be
drawn down.
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and
services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified
as current liabilities if payment is due within 1 year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at transaction price
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.
Derivatives are not basic financial instruments. Derivatives
are initially recognised at fair value on the date the
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
re-measured at their fair value at the reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs
or finance income as appropriate.
The University applies the principles of hedge accounting
to derivatives which are set up as a cash-flow hedge to
protect against the possibility of future interest payments
on loans (deemed the hedged item) being higher than the
interest rate at inception. Further details are included in
the statement of accounting estimates and judgements.
Accordingly changes in the fair value of the derivative are
reflected as a movement in the cash-flow hedge reserve
as opposed to recognition through finance costs to the
extent that the hedge is deemed effective. Effectiveness
of the hedge is determined by application of the dollar
offset method.
Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the liability is
discharged, cancelled or expires.
20. Reserves
Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted.
Restricted endowment reserves include balances which,
through endowment to the University, are held as a
permanently restricted fund which the University must
hold in perpetuity.
Other restricted reserves include balances where the
donor has designated a specific purpose and therefore the
University is restricted in the use of these funds.

The University entered into three loans with Lloyds Bank at LIBOR plus 20 basis points of £50m, £25m and £25m between the dates of 31October 2005 to 30
September 2007. The currency of all of these is sterling and the interest is paid in arrears on the last day of its interest period, which is semi-annual. The

interest periods have start/end dates of 7 June and 7 December with a final end date on all 3 facilities being 7 December 2040 and with a final repayment due
Lloyds 20,574 2040 4.58 University
for the outstanding balance. Brunel has written confirmation that the loans can be renegotiated to extend to 7 December 2045 on the same payment profile as
Lloyds 20,387 2040 4.58 University
the SWAPs taken out at the same time.
81,385
The University set up three sterling SWAPs with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, being £50m at 4.588% on 31 October 2005, £25m at 4.5843% on 30 September
2006 and £25m at 4.5823% on 30 September 2007. Brunel pays interest on each SWAP in arrears on the last day of the interest period. Both the fixed and
floating rate payment schedules have payment dates of 7 June and 7 December. All three SWAPs have an end date of 7 December 2045. The three SWAPs
were novated to Lloyds in June 2019 on the same terms.

The SWAPs were set up on the same dates as the loans with the same repayment profiles until 2040 and to run for the 5 additional years until 7 December 2045
that the loans will eventually be extended to. The SWAPs were designed as a hedging instrument that effectively eliminates the interest rate risk of the variability
in cash flows on the floating rate loan attributable to changes in the 6 month GBP LIBOR by creating certainty of interest payment at the same 6 monthly interval.
The University considers the 3 SWAPs to be 100% effective hedges and apply the principles of hedge accounting of 12.23 FRS 102 to disclose a cash-flow
hedge reserve for the same total as the fair value of the SWAP liability in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Reserves.

in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. In calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the duration
of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out below and further information is provided in note 29.

(i)Teachers Pension Scheme
TPS is an unfunded defined benefit scheme administered by the Teachers Pensions agency in accordance with the Teachers' Superannuation (Consolidation)
Regulations 1988. Contributions on a 'pay as you go' basis are paid to the Exchequer under arrangements governed by the Superannuation Act 1972.
It is not possible to identify the University's share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme and hence, using the exemption under FRS 102,
contributions to the scheme are accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme with the cost recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
and Expenditure account being equal to the contributions payable to the scheme.
As the scheme is backed by the taxpayer there is no deficit liable to the University and no deficit recovery program and consequent liability placed upon the
University.
(ii) The Universities Superannuation Scheme
Brunel University London participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS - "The Scheme"). The Scheme is a hybrid pension scheme, providing
defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Because of the mutual nature of the Scheme, the assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a Scheme-wide contribution rate is set. Brunel is therefore
exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its shares of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme
on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee Benefits”, Brunel therefore accounts for the Scheme as if it were a
wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to I&E represents the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered
into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the Scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for
the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and therefore an expense is recognised.

the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and therefore an expense is recognised.

The total cost charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is £15.2m (2019–20 £14.6m).
The University participates as an Admitted Body in the LPFA which is administered in accordance with the Local Government Pensions Scheme Regulations
Deficit recovery contributions due within 1 year for the university are £4.2m (2019-20 £1.4m). 1997. The fund is valued every 3 years by actuaries, and the projected unit method is used in respect of the Active Sub-Fund in which the University participates.
Each participating employer has their own contribution rate reflecting the long-term future service rate, adjusted for the funding level in respect of past service.
For the year ended 31 March 2021, the employer's contribution rate was 17.0% (14.4% March 20). However, the University was required to pay a lump sum of

schedule. The employer contributions were £4.07m (£3.70m in 2020) and the employee's contributions were £1.15m (£1.15m 2020).
Since the University cannot identify its share of the Retirement Income Builder section of the Scheme assets and liabilities, the following disclosures reflect those
The following information regarding the LPFA is based on the full actuarial valuation of the fund as at 31 March 2019, rolled forward to 31 March 2021 by Barnett
relevant for the Scheme as a whole.
Waddingham, an independent firm of actuaries. The major assumptions are:
The 2018 valuation was the fifth valuation for USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes to 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017
adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the
assets of the Scheme was £63.7 billion and the value of the Scheme's technical provisions was £67.3 billion indicating a shortfall of £3.6 billion and a funding Inflation (CPI) 2.60% 2.20% 2.40% 2.35% 2.60%
ratio of 95%. Rate of increase in salaries 3.60% 3.20% 3.90% 3.85% 4.10%
Rate of increase in pensions 2.70% 2.20% 2.10% 2.35% 2.60%
The key financial assumptions used in the 2018 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the statement of funding principles. Discount rate 1.60% 1.60% 2.10% 2.65% 2.70%
Pension increases (CPI) Term dependent rates in line with the difference between the Fixed Interest and Interest Linked yield curves less 1.3% p.a. There has been a change in the future improvements table from CMI2018 to CMI2020 to reflect the latest available industry data at the balance sheet date.
Further, the mortality assumption at 31 July 2021 does not reflect the potential reduction in pension liability because of COVID-19, given there remains
Discount rate (forward Years 1-10: CPI +0.14% reducing linearly to CPI -0.73% uncertainty of the pandemic effect on long term mortality rates and currently do not have evidence for making such an assessment on longer term expectations.
Rates) Years 11-20: CPI +2.52% reducing linearly to CPI +1.55% by year 21 Therefore, a rate of 0% rather than 25% is applied to the 2020 mortality experience.
Years 21+: CPI +1.55%
The proposed assumptions for future mortality improvements can therefore be considered to lead to the best estimate of the future cashflows that will arise
under the plan, consistent with the requirements of FRS102 28.16.
A new deficit recovery program was put in place as part of the 2018 valuation, which requires payment of 2% of salaries over the period 1 October 2019 to 30
September 2021 at which point the rates will increase to 6%, until 31 March 2028. The 2020 deficit recovery reflects this plan.

provisions introduced to the reformed judges and firefighters pension schemes in 2015 gave rise to unlawful age discrimination. The ruling relates to the transitional
protection offered to some members – broadly those within 10 years of retirement age for the LGPS when the reformed schemes were introduced. The court had
found that those too far away from retirement age to qualify for these transitional protections had been unfairly discriminated against. As transitional protection was
