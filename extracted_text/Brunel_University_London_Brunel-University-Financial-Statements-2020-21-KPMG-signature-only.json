Other income consists of student residences income, conference, hotel, retail and also income from summer\n        school activity for foreign language students on the campus. All categories were significantly impacted by the pandemic,\n        including the decision by the University not to charge rent for accommodation during the period when government\n        guidance did not permit students to return to university after the Christmas break and allowing students to be released from\n        their accommodation agreements for the final term of the year.            \n        Tuition fee income increased by £17.0m to £155.1m reflecting the increase in student numbers.\n        Research grant income for 2020/21 was £5.2m lower than in 2019/20 on a recognised income basis. Research income\n        reflects the timing of work undertaken on research grants, as income is recognised in the financial statements over a period\n        typically averaging three years. The decline reflects reduced research activity in the year due to the restrictions imposed by\n        the pandemic.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n        Tuition fee income increased by £17.0m to £155.1m                         \n        reflecting the increase in student numbers.                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        Expenditure                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        Excluding the non-recurring items detailed in the Operating Results paragraphs above, expenditure was £8.3m (3.5%) higher\n        than in 2019/20.

Staff costs are impacted by the movement\n        in the pension provisions. Excluding pension adjustments, staff costs of £140.9m were £5.0m (4.0%) higher than in 2019/20\n        as a result of general staff inflation and the continued investment in academic provision in areas which have seen increased\n        tuition fee income and student numbers.                                   \n        Other operating expenditure of £81.2m (excluding impairment adjustments) has increased by £4.3m (5.5%) reflecting\n        inflationary cost increases. Depreciation costs are marginally lower than 2019/20, offsetting the increased costs\n        described above.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        18 | Brunel University London",

The University was unable\n        at the inception of the loan to obtain a 40-year loan as intended because 35 years was the maximum offered at that time. As a result, the three loans all contain a\nBalances at 1 August 2020 183 175 balloon payment on 7 December 2040.The SWAPS were set at 40 years in anticipation that Lloyds would reconsider the final repayment date further into the loan\n        repayment program. Brunel has received written confirmation from Lloyds Bank that they are willing to negotiate an extension prior to 7 December 2040 which Brunel\n        would take to 2045 on the same repayment dates as the SWAP.
