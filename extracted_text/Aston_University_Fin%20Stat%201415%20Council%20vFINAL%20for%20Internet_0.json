The contingent liability relates to the amount generated by past service\n      or current members and the associated proportion of the deficit. Given that the scheme is a multi-employer\n      scheme and the institution is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities, the contingent\n      liability is not recognised as a provision on the balance sheet. The associated receivable from the scheme in\n      respect of the reimbursement of the Company’s expenditure is similarly not recognised.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      46",

USS provides benefits based on final pensionable salary for\n      academic and academic-related employees of all UK universities and other employees. AUPS provides similarly\n      calculated benefits for other staff of the University. Whilst all of these schemes are defined benefit schemes, for\n      the reasons explained below USS is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme.

The assets of the scheme are held in a separate\n      trustee-administered fund, Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited. Because of the mutual nature of the\n      scheme, the scheme’s assets are not hypothecated to individual institutions and a scheme- wide contribution rate\n      is set. The institution is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the pension scheme to\n      fund the benefits payable to the institutions employees. In 2015, the percentage was 16% (2014: 16%). The\n      institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institution’s employees and is unable to\n      identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and\n      therefore, as required by FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined\n      contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure account represents the\n      contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.    \n                                                                                  \n      There was neither a prepayment nor an accrual at the end of the financial year in respect of these contributions.\n      The disclosures below represent the position from the scheme’s financial statements.\n                                                                                  \n      The latest available triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation date”),\n      which was carried out using the projected unit method and is currently being audited by the scheme auditor.\n      Based on this 2014 valuation it is expected that employer contributions will increase to 18% from 01 April 2016.\n                                                                                  \n      The 2014 Valuation was the third valuation for USS under the scheme - specific funding regime introduced by the\n      Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and\n      appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the\n      scheme was £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion indicating a shortfall\n      of £5.3 billion. The assets therefore were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had accrued to members\n      after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      FRS17 liability numbers have been produced using the following assumptions: \n                                                                                  \n                                                 2015                  2014       \n       Discount Rate                             3.3%                   4.5%      \n       Pensionable salary growth  3.5% in the first year and 4.0%       4.4%      \n                                              thereafter                          \n       Price inflation (CPI)                     2.2%                   2.6%      \n                                                                                  \n      The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions.
