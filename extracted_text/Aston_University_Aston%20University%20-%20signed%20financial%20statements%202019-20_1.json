In line with our strategy, the beneficiaries\n                of the University – students, business and the professions, and our region – have been at the\n                forefront of our response to COVID-19 as their future success is critical to us.\n                The year started positively with a growing student population as we welcomed students\n                from over 120 different countries around the world. Aston has long been recognised\n                as a university that equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in\n                businesses and the professions and our integrated placement year remains very popular,\n                with the majority of our students spending a year in business, a year abroad, or in pre-\n                registration for subjects allied to medicine. As we move forward, our focus is on ensuring\n                that as many students as possible are able to experience a placement despite challenges\n                resulting from COVID-19.                                          \n                                                                                  \n                In March, with the UK in lockdown and the majority of students having returned home,\n                we moved quickly to enable the delivery of teaching and assessments on-line and it is a\n                testament to our staff how well this transition was implemented. This was supported by\n                investment in our digital infrastructure and this will continue as the University accelerates\n                the implementation of our Digital strategy. Our work continues to ensure that we\n                maintain our high quality education experience through blended learning.\n                We have continued to demonstrate our commitment to research excellence by establishing\n                and investing in four University Research Institutes during 2018/19. This, along with our\n                focus on collaborative research with high translation and impact, has seen us continue to\n                grow our research to £30 million in new research grants, our best result to date. We\n                continue to support both businesses and the region through our research, specifically\n                focusing on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on society.       \n                                                                                  \n                During the pandemic the University has worked with a number of our beneficiaries, providing\n                accommodation and PPE for key workers, as well as donating food to local charities and\n                running a foodbank in connection with Aston Students’ Union.      \n                Our financial performance in 2019/20 has been good despite the challenges to our\n                commercial operations and delivery of research that arose as a result of lockdown. We have\n                continued to invest in our campus provision with an increase in student study space, updates\n                to teaching rooms and investment in research.                     \n                                                                                  \n                Looking forward, we continue to work to ensure that Aston University is as safe as possible\n                for all our beneficiaries and staff as we welcome students back on campus for the coming\n                academic year.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                         3",

AUPS is now a closed\n     scheme to new entrants and future accrual and all existing members now have deferred benefits.\n     AUPS is a defined benefit scheme which was externally funded and for the period up to 5 April 2016 was contracted\n     out of the State Second Pension (S2P). From 6 April 2016, contracting out ceased with the introduction of the\n     Government’s new state pension. The fund is valued every three years by professionally qualified independent\n     actuaries. The last formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2019.\n                                                                                  \n     USS is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits.\n     The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the\n     scheme, the assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The\n     institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify\n     its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by\n     Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined\n     contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions\n     payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how\n     each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for the contributions\n     payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) with related expenses being\n     recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                        28",

These assumptions include the RPI%,\n     CPI%, salary increases, pension increases, mortality rates, discount rate and the estimate of the duration of employer\n     liabilities.                                                                 \n     The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill and judgement in setting these parameters as the\n     pension experts rather than suggesting a rate.                               \n                                                                                  \n     Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach and\n     the full actuarial valuation will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.\n     Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)                                     \n                                                                                  \n     FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a\n     collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a\n     scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as Universities\n     Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has entered into an\n     agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the recognition of a liability\n     for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the\n     resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that USS\n     meets the definition of a multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the\n     contractual contributions under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.\n     The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit required in the financial statements has used\n     assumptions on staff salary inflation percentages and the percentage change in staff numbers in subsequent years.\n     In making the estimated percentages, management considered past movement in salary inflation and staff numbers\n     as well as considering the University’s strategic plans, current economic climate and consistency with AUPS\n     assumptions.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                        32",

Agency\n     staff are used for a range of activities across the University, however, they are often not full-time, are charged for via\n     third parties often on a consolidated basis and the rate charged includes a fee to the third party and VAT.

The Vice Chancellor is\n     not a member of the USS pension scheme and therefore there were no employer contributions in 2019/20\n     or 2018/19. The University made a benefit replacement payment in lieu of pension contributions to USS.\n     The performance of the Vice Chancellor is monitored throughout the year including through 1:1\n     performance appraisal with the Chair of Council. In previous years Executive officers, including the Vice-\n     Chancellor, have had access to an annual bonus based on a combination of overall University performance\n     against key performance measures agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the outset of the\n     performance cycle and performance against individual objectives agreed with the Chair of Council. The\n                                                                                  \n     Nominations and Remuneration Committee decided not to award bonus payments to the Vice-Chancellor\n     and other eligible members of the University Executive for 2017/18 and to discontinue the Executive Bonus\n     Scheme.                                                                      \n     In setting the pay of the Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Committee uses a variety of benchmark data\n     sets to get a rounded picture of what fair and competitive base pay looks like for the role at Aston\n     University. The primary comparison is carried out using several different data ‘cuts’ of the UCEA Senior\n     Staff Remuneration Report which provide a well-rounded picture of where the incumbent sits relative to the\n     wider Higher Education Sector. The conclusion of that comparison has determined that the base and total\n                                                                                  \n     reward for the role at Aston is fairly positioned against the market.        \n     Additionally, the Remuneration Committee also commissioned an independent external review of senior\n     remuneration which reported in September 2018. This included an analysis of the Vice-Chancellor’s reward\n     using different metrics to help form a more-rounded picture of the appropriate level of pay when set against\n     the University’s performance against a variety of measures. This review also used an analysis against the\n     wider private and public sectors to provide a benchmark of levels of pay for senior roles found in these\n     markets. This analysis has similarly concluded that the remuneration of the Vice-Chancellor is fair,\n                                                                                  \n     appropriate and justifiable.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                        41",

The\n     £5,340,842 target in the published plan relates to these categories, and against these the University\n     exceeded planned spend in year, with actual spend of £5,738,765 (£397,923 over target). Within this there\n     was a small underspend against planned Access investment due to the impact of Covid-19.\n                                                                                  \n     OfS guidance required that spend for 2019/20, while planned based on the four categories noted above\n     should be reported using the new categories in place for 2020/21 plans (Access Investment, Financial\n     Support to Students, Support for disabled Students and Research and evaluation). As such, only spend\n     incurred in 2019/20 that would meet the criteria for inclusion in the new categories is shown above.\n     £182,070 of the above figures relate to staff costs for individuals who are intrinsic to the delivery of access\n     and participation activity.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Details of the University’s Access and Participation Plan 2020-2025 can be found at\n     https://www2.aston.ac.uk/about/documents/astonuniversity-app-2020-2025.pdf.  \n                                                                                  \n     As set out in the Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41), no prior-year comparatives are required.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                        45",

These financial risks are managed within the parameters\n     specified by the Finance Committee approved Treasury Management Policy. The treasury management\n     policy adopts the key recommendations of the Code of Practice on Treasury Management in Public Service\n     as issued by Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) as recommended by the\n     Office for Students and is reviewed and updated annually.                    \n                                                                                  \n     The University’s principal financial instruments are cash, investments and loans. The core objective of\n     these financial instruments is to meet the financing needs of the University’s operations. Additionally, the\n     University has other financial assets and liabilities arising directly from its operations i.e. trade debtors and\n     creditors.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n     Credit risk                                                                  \n     Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a\n     financial loss to the University.                                            \n                                                                                  \n     The University’s credit risk arises from bank balances, investments, student debtors and commercial\n     organisations as customers. Management of credit risk is a prime objective of the Treasury Management\n     Policy. At 31 July 2020, the maximum exposure is represented by the carrying value of each financial\n     asset in the balance sheet.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     The credit risk of liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with\n     investment grade credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The University’s exposure\n     and the credit ratings of its counterparties are monitored regularly. The credit exposure is limited by\n     counterparty limits and minimum counter party credit ratings set within the Treasury Management Policy.\n                                                                                  \n                                        64",

Regular monitoring of liquidity risk is an essential feature of treasury management activities.\n                                                                                  \n     Cash flow forecasts form part of the University’s 5 year strategic model and are revised during the financial\n     year. The University policy is to maintain a minimum of £10m in on-call cash balances. Excess funds are\n     invested to maximise the return whilst observing the Treasury Management Policy limits.\n     Foreign currency risk                                                        \n                                                                                  \n     Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that unfavourable movement in exchange rates may cause financial\n     loss to the University. The University’s principal foreign currency exposure is to the euro. On an annual\n     basis after satisfying euro denominated liabilities the University is left with a surplus of Euros. Surplus\n     euros are converted at spot rates or via forward contracts that are used to mitigate the risk of adverse\n     exchange rate movements.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n     Interest rate risk                                                           \n                                                                                  \n     Interest rate risk refers to the likelihood that changes in interest rates will result in fluctuations of the value\n     of balance sheet items (i.e. price risk) or changes in interest income or expenses (i.e. re-investments risk).\n     Financial instruments – fair values                                          \n                                                                                  \n     The fair values of each category of the University’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying\n     value in the balance sheet.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                        65",
