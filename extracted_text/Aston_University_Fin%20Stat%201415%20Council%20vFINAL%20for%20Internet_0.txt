the University. The weighted average interest rate for this loan is 3.75% p.a. In addition the University took on a
new loan from the European Investment Bank in April 2015 to invest in capital infrastructure. Repayments have
not yet started on this loan as there is a repayment holiday of 3 years but when they do, payments will be in
November and May every year. The interest rate for this loan is 3.021%.

Notes To The Financial Statements
The University has an arrangement with the West Midlands Pension Fund to repay a deficit arising on leaving the
scheme over a period of 6 years, ending in April 2019.
The University has reviewed its procedures in relation to cheque writeoffs alongside introducing a policy to no
longer issues cheques. This long term creditor represents cheques issued up to seven years ago but we intend to
take action to repay or write off the creditor during the next two years.
In February 2014 the University purchased the land at Fisher Triangle from Birmingham City Council having
previously held a leasehold interest over the land. The Council retains a charge over the property until March
2017 when the University will pay a further sum of £490,000 to the Council.

leasing commitments of £70,300 are due to expire within one year, with £34,649 due to expire within two to five
years. There is a finance lease for IT Network Infrastructure with £244,775 due within one year and £542,815 due
within two to five years. Other lease commitments payable within one year are £4,419.
25. Capital Commitments And Contingent Liabilities
At the year end, capital commitments for items authorised and contracted for but not yet received by the
University amounted to £5,999,534 (2013-14: £2,390,066).
The University has a Section 278 Highways Act 1980 bond with Birmingham City Council for £31,282. This bond
relates to the carrying out of works to Aston Street, Birmingham. In the event that the University fail to meet the
terms of the Section 278 agreement the bond will be paid to Birmingham City Council.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the USS pension valuation recovery plan, since the institution is an
employer of member within the scheme. The contingent liability relates to the amount generated by past service
or current members and the associated proportion of the deficit. Given that the scheme is a multi-employer
scheme and the institution is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities, the contingent
liability is not recognised as a provision on the balance sheet. The associated receivable from the scheme in
respect of the reimbursement of the Company’s expenditure is similarly not recognised.

26. Events After The Reporting Period
The University intends to demolish buildings which it owns bordering the A38, and has recognised this decision,
minuted at Finance Committee on 19th November 2015, as an impairment in 2014/15. This has been done in
order to ensure that the assets, which are in poor condition and contain asbestos, are not overvalued as at the
closing balance sheet date. The value of the impairment has been based on an independent valuation performed
by GVA Grimleys as at 31 July 2015.
27. Related Party Transactions
Due to the nature of the University’s operations and the members of Council being drawn from local, public and
private sector organisations, it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a member
of Council or a member of the senior management team may have an interest.
All such transactions, including those identified below, are conducted at arm’s length and in accordance with the
University’s Financial Regulations and normal procurement procedures.
The University has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 8 (Related Party Disclosures) and has not
disclosed transactions with subsidiaries that are wholly owned.
Related parties were identified by examining returns submitted by members of Council and senior management
team members for the financial year 2014-15, as well as performing an online check via Creditsafe.
These financial statements include the following transactions with related parties. No information has been listed
for organisations where the income and expenditure is less than £200,000 in the financial year.

33. Pension Schemes
The two principal pension schemes for the University's staff are the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
and the Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). USS provides benefits based on final pensionable salary for
academic and academic-related employees of all UK universities and other employees. AUPS provides similarly
calculated benefits for other staff of the University. Whilst all of these schemes are defined benefit schemes, for
the reasons explained below USS is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme. For the other
schemes FRS17 requires the deficit in the scheme to be reflected in the accounts and the movements in the
deficit to be reflected partly as a pension cost in the Income and Expenditure account and partly in the Statement
of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The total pension cost for the University was:
2014-15 2013-14
£000 £000
Contributions to USS 10,055 9,347
Contributions to AUPS including FRS 17 adjustment 1,962 2,019

Notes To The Financial Statements
33. Pension Schemes Continued
USS
The institution participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (USS), a defined benefit scheme
which is contracted out of the State Second Pension (S2P). The assets of the scheme are held in a separate
trustee-administered fund, Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited. Because of the mutual nature of the
scheme, the scheme’s assets are not hypothecated to individual institutions and a scheme- wide contribution rate
is set. The institution is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the pension scheme to
fund the benefits payable to the institutions employees. In 2015, the percentage was 16% (2014: 16%). The
institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institution’s employees and is unable to
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and
therefore, as required by FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined
contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure account represents the
contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
There was neither a prepayment nor an accrual at the end of the financial year in respect of these contributions.
The disclosures below represent the position from the scheme’s financial statements.
The latest available triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 (“the valuation date”),
which was carried out using the projected unit method and is currently being audited by the scheme auditor.
Based on this 2014 valuation it is expected that employer contributions will increase to 18% from 01 April 2016.
The 2014 Valuation was the third valuation for USS under the scheme - specific funding regime introduced by the
Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and
appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the
scheme was £41.6 billion and the value of the scheme’s technical provisions was £46.9 billion indicating a shortfall
of £5.3 billion. The assets therefore were sufficient to cover 89% of the benefits which had accrued to members
after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
FRS17 liability numbers have been produced using the following assumptions:
2015 2014
Discount Rate 3.3% 4.5%
Pensionable salary growth 3.5% in the first year and 4.0% 4.4%
thereafter
Price inflation (CPI) 2.2% 2.6%
The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. Mortality in retirement is assumed
to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation’s (CMI) S1NA tables as follows:
Male members’ mortality no age rating
Female members’ mortality rated down 1 year
51


================================================================================
PAGE 54
================================================================================

Notes To The Financial Statements
33. Pension Schemes Continued
The use of these mortality tables reasonably reflects the actual USS experience. To allow for further
improvements in mortality rates the CMI 2009 projections with a 1.25% pa long term rate were also adopted for
the 2014 FRS17 figures, for the March 2015 figures the long term rate has been increased to 1.5% and the CMI
2014 projections adopted, and the tables have been weighted by 98% for males and 99% for females. The
current life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:
2015 2014
Males currently aged 65 years 24.2 23.7
Females currently aged 65 years 26.3 25.6
Males currently ages 45 years 26.2 25.5
Females currently aged 45 years 28.6 27.6

Scheme assets £49.0bn £41.6bn
FRS 17 liabilities £67.6bn £55.5bn
FRS17 deficit £18.6bn £13.9bn
FRS17 funding level 72% 75%
AUPS
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The Scheme is a defined benefit
scheme which is funded and valued every three years by the actuary using the projected unit method, the rates of
contribution payable being determined by the trustees on the advice of the actuary. A full actuarial valuation was
carried out at 1 April 2013 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes by a qualified independent actuary. The material
assumptions and other data used by the actuary were:
2014-15 2013-14 2012-13
Salary scale increases per annum 2.8% 2.8% 3.8%
Pension increases per annum (post 1.9.90 joiners) 3.2% 3.2% 3.3%
Pension increases per annum (pre 1.9.90 joiners) 3.7% 3.7% 3.6%
Discount rate 3.6% 4.1% 4.5%
Price inflation 3.3% 3.3% 3.3%
The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions
which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The FRS 17 valuation has used RPI as the inflationary index to calculate scheme liabilities for current members
and used CPI in respect of deferred members.

Notes To The Financial Statements
33. Pension Schemes Continued
NEST
From 1 August 2013, the University has been required to automatically enrol its workers into a workplace pension
scheme if they meet certain qualifying criteria, and are not members of any other scheme. Auto-enrolment does
not replace the existing arrangements for contractual enrolment into AUPS/USS for regular employees. However
auto-enrolment does apply to regular employees that have opted out of AUPS or USS, or who may opt out in the
future, USS pensioners and casual workers. The University has chosen to offer NEST (the National Employment
Savings Trust) as its workplace pension scheme for its casual workers.
34. Fees Paid To External Auditor
Fees paid to the University's external auditor for the provision of audit services amounted to £33,600 for the
University and £4,300 for its subsidiary companies (2013-14: £32,900 for the University and £4,840 for its
subsidiary companies). Fees to the auditors for the provision of non-audit services amounted to £113,189 for the
University and £16,320 for the subsidiary companies (2013-14: £86,452 for the University and £4,250 for the
subsidiary companies). Non-audit services comprise advice on corporate structures, taxation matters including
the preparation of the first Research and Development Credit claim, and the audit of capital and revenue grants.
