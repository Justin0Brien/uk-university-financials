The SWAPs were designed as a hedging instrument that effectively eliminates the\n            interest rate risk of the variability in cash flows on the floating rate loan attributable to changes in the 6-month GBP SONIA by creating\n            certainty of interest payment at the same 6 monthly interval.         \n            The University considers the 3 SWAPs to be 100% effective hedges and apply the principles of hedge accounting of 12.23 FRS 102 to disclose\n            a cash-flow hedge reserve for the same total as the fair value of the SWAP liability in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Reserves.\n            The full value of the loans and the out of market position of the SWAPs are secured against several specific halls of residence with a NBV\n            of £45m.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n            62 | Brunel University London",

Contributions on a ‘pay as you go’ basis are paid to the Exchequer under arrangements\n            governed by the Superannuation Act 1972.                              \n            It is not possible to identify the University’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme and hence, using the exemption\n            under FRS 102, contributions to the scheme are accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme with the cost recognised in the\n            Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure account being equal to the contributions payable to the scheme.\n            As the scheme is backed by the taxpayer there is no deficit liable to the University and no deficit recovery program and consequent\n            liability placed upon the University.                                 \n            (ii) The Universities Superannuation Scheme                           \n            Brunel University London participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS - “The Scheme”) which is the main scheme\n            covering most academic and professional level staff. The Scheme is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all\n            members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.\n            USS is a multi-employer scheme and is accounted for as set out in the accounting policies.\n            The total cost charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is £16.1m (2020–21 £15.2m) including PensionChoice, but\n            excluding the impact of the change in the deficit recovery plan, as shown in note 23.\n            Deficit recovery contributions due within 1 year for the university are £1.8m (2020-21 £4.2m).\n            Since the University cannot identify its share of the Retirement Income Builder section of the Scheme assets and liabilities, the following\n            disclosures reflect those relevant for the Scheme as a whole.         \n            The 2020 valuation was the sixth valuation for USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004,\n            which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical\n            provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the Scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the Scheme’s technical\n            provisions was £80.6 billion indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.\n            The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the statement of funding principles\n            (uss.co.uk/about-us/valuation-and-funding/statement-of-funding-principles).\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n            68 | Brunel University London",

Pension schemes (continued)                                       \n            (iii) Local Government Pension Scheme – London Pensions Fund Authority (LPFA)\n            The University participates as an Admitted Body in the LPFA which is administered in accordance with the Local Government Pensions\n            Scheme Regulations 1997. The fund is valued every 3 years by actuaries, and the projected unit method is used in respect of the Active\n            Sub-Fund in which the University participates. Each participating employer has their own contribution rate reflecting the long-term future\n            service rate, adjusted for the funding level in respect of past service. For the year ended 31 March 2022, the employer’s contribution\n            rate was 17.0% (17.0% March 21). However, the University was required to pay a lump sum of £1.06m in April 2022 (and £1.02m in April\n            2021) in respect of past service benefits. The employee’s rate from 1 April 2011 is based on a banded earnings schedule. The employer\n            contributions were £4.31m (£4.07m in 2021) and the employee’s contributions were £1.22m (£1.15m 2021).\n            The following information regarding the LPFA is based on the full actuarial valuation of the fund as at 31 March 2019, rolled forward to 31\n            March 2022 by Barnett Waddingham, an independent firm of actuaries. The major assumptions are:\n                                        2022     2021    2020    2019    2018     \n            Inflation (CPI)             2.75%   2.60%   2.20%    2.40%   2.35%    \n            Rate of increase in salaries 3.65%  3.60%   3.20%    3.90%   3.85%    \n            Rate of increase in pensions 2.75%  2.70%   2.20%    2.10%   2.35%    \n            Discount rate               3.50%   1.60%    1.60%   2.10%   2.65%    \n                                                                                  \n            CMI2020 reflects the latest available industry data at the balance sheet date and was used in both 2020/21 and 2021/22. Further, the\n            mortality assumption at 31 July 2022 does not reflect the potential reduction in pension liability because of COVID-19, given there remains\n            uncertainty of the pandemic effect on long term mortality rates and currently do not have evidence for making such an assessment on\n            longer term expectations. Therefore, a rate of 0% rather than 25% is applied to the 2020 mortality experience.\n            The proposed assumptions for future mortality improvements can therefore be considered to lead to the best estimate of the future\n            cashflows that will arise under the plan, consistent with the requirements of FRS102 28.16.\n            The current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates.

Recent changes in global and UK economic pressures and tightening\n      of monetary policy have had a significant impact on asset markets and corporate bonds yields, which are key to the FRS102 assessment of\n      the net pension liability. In particular, AA corporate bond yields, used to set the FRS102 discount rate, have increased significantly since 31\n      July 2022, with corresponding falls in asset values. The markets have been exceptionally volatile and therefore while both gross DBOs and\n      assets will have fallen, it is difficult to estimate the impact of these changes on the net balance sheet position.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                        Brunel University London | 71",

The ruling relates to the transitional protection offered to some members – broadly those within 10 years of\n            retirement age for the LGPS when the reformed schemes were introduced. The court had found that those too far away from retirement\n            age to qualify for these transitional protections had been unfairly discriminated against. As transitional protection was offered to\n            members of all the public service pension schemes, the government believes that the difference in treatment will need to be remedied\n            across all of those schemes. This includes the LGPS scheme.           \n            Allowance was made in the Financial Statements of 2018-19 for the estimated impact on the total liabilities as a result of this case. The\n            adjustment was based on analysis carried out by the Government Actuary’s department (GAD) and the employer’s liability profile and\n            allowances continue to be reflected thereafter in the financial statements.\n            34.
