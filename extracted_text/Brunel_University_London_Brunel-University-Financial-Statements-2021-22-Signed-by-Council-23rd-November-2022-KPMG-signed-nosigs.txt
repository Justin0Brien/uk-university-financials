Financial Statements 2021/22 | - Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2022
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            The present Vice-Chancellor’s basic salary is 5.1 times (7.2 times previous VC July 21) the median pay of staff, where the median pay is
            calculated on a full-time equivalent basis for the salaries paid to staff. The Vice-Chancellor’s total remuneration is 5.3 times (6.1 times
            previous VC July 21) the median total remuneration of staff, where the median total remuneration is calculated on a full-time equivalent
            basis for the total remuneration of its staff. The University has included the costs of employees who are required to be included in real-
            time reporting to HMRC and excluding those who are not.               
            The University considers the remuneration of the Vice-Chancellor to be justified, taking account of the scale and nature of the institution,
            the challenges of the role, benchmarking information and performance over time. Further detail is in the Remunerations Committee
            Report section of these financial statements.                         
            The number of staff with a basic salary of over £100,000 per annum has been included below. The table excludes employer’s pension
            contributions and all performance related elements; there were no performance related benefits in 2022 (2021 nil).

      There was £638k combined compensation for loss of office paid to 32 staff members in 2021/22 (2020/21 £677k, 43 staff members).
      All severance payments including compensation for loss of office in respect of higher paid staff are approved by the Remuneration
      Committee. Amounts for compensation for loss of office and redundancy for all other members of staff are approved by the university’s
      management in accordance with delegated authority.

      The University’s Council members are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the University’s operations and the
      composition of the Council, being drawn from local public and private sector organisations, it is inevitable that transactions will take place
      with organisations in which a member of the Council may have an interest. All transactions involving organisations in which a member
      of Council may have an interest, including those identified below, are conducted at arm’s length and in accordance with the University’s
       Financial Regulations and usual procurement procedures.                    
      The total expenses paid to or on behalf of 11 Council members was £168 (2021 - £2,750 to 11 Council members). This represents travel and
      subsistence expenses incurred in attending Council, Committee meetings and Charity events in their official capacity.
       Related parties                                                            
       During the year the University entered into transactions in the ordinary course of business with other related parties.
       During the year the University entered into transactions in the ordinary course of business with other related parties. The current Vice-

            The costs disclosed above include expenditure on staff costs of £1.5m (2021 £1.5m). These costs are included within the total staff costs disclosed in note 9
            above.                                                                
            The University’s expenditure on the four strands of the Access and Participation activity is broadly in line with the commitments made in the published
            Access and Participation plan, although the Financial Support element is slightly lower than anticipated for 2021/22 due to the reduced demand for hardship
            support to students following the easing of the covid-19 pandemic.

            21. Cash-flow Hedge Reserve and fair value of hedged instrument liability
                                                                                  
            The University entered into three loans with Lloyds Bank at LIBOR plus 20 basis points of £50m, £25m and £25m between the dates of
            31 October 2005 to 30 September 2007 (subsequently transitioned to SONIA in December 2021). The currency of all of these is sterling
            and the interest is paid in arrears on the last day of its interest period, which is semi-annual. The interest periods have start/end dates of 7
            June and 7 December with a final end date on all 3 facilities being 7 December 2040 and with a final repayment due for the outstanding
            balance. Brunel has written confirmation that the loans can be renegotiated to extend to 7 December 2045 on the same payment profile
            as the SWAPs taken out at the same time.                              
            The University set up three sterling SWAPs with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, being £50m at 4.588% on 31 October 2005, £25m at
            4.5843% on 30 September 2006 and £25m at 4.5823% on 30 September 2007. Brunel pays interest on each SWAP in arrears on the last
            day of the interest period. Both the fixed and floating rate payment schedules have payment dates of 7 June and 7 December. All three
            SWAPs have an end date of 7 December 2045. The three SWAPs were novated to Lloyds in June 2019 on the same terms
            Fair value of the SWAP liability as at 31 July obtained from Bloomberg:

            Change in fair value of hedging instrument recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (19,973) (12,385)
            in year (100% effective)                                              
            Carried forward 31 July                             21,547  41,520    
                                                                                  
            The SWAPs were set up on the same dates as the loans with the same repayment profiles until 2040 and to run for the 5 additional years
            until 7 December 2045 that the loans will eventually be extended to, following confirmation from Lloyds Bank that they are willing to
            negotiate an extension prior to 7 December 2040. The SWAPs were designed as a hedging instrument that effectively eliminates the
            interest rate risk of the variability in cash flows on the floating rate loan attributable to changes in the 6-month GBP SONIA by creating
            certainty of interest payment at the same 6 monthly interval.         
            The University considers the 3 SWAPs to be 100% effective hedges and apply the principles of hedge accounting of 12.23 FRS 102 to disclose
            a cash-flow hedge reserve for the same total as the fair value of the SWAP liability in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Reserves.
            The full value of the loans and the out of market position of the SWAPs are secured against several specific halls of residence with a NBV
            of £45m.

            23. Provisions for liabilities (continued)                            
            Pension enhancement                                                   
            The assumptions for calculating the provision for pension enhancements on termination under FRS 102 are as follows:
                                                                                  
                                                                     Consolidated 
            Discount rate                                                2.96 %   
                                                                                  
            Inflation                                                    3.01 %   
                                                                                  
            USS deficit                                                           
            The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the contractual obligation with the
            USS to make deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. In calculating this provision, management have estimated
            future staff levels within the USS scheme for the duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out
            below and further information is provided in note 34.                 
            The major assumptions used to calculate the provision are             
                                                                                  
                                                         2022            2021     
            Discount rate                               3.33%            0.89%    
            Salary growth                               4.00%            2.50%    
                                                                                  
            As set out in the accounting policies, there are some critical judgements made in estimating the obligation to fund the USS deficit.
            The sensitivity of the principal assumptions used to measure the USS deficit provision are set out below:

            (i) Teachers Pension Scheme                                           
            TPS is an unfunded defined benefit scheme administered by the Teachers Pensions agency in accordance with the Teachers’
            Superannuation (Consolidation) Regulations 1988. Contributions on a ‘pay as you go’ basis are paid to the Exchequer under arrangements
            governed by the Superannuation Act 1972.                              
            It is not possible to identify the University’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme and hence, using the exemption
            under FRS 102, contributions to the scheme are accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme with the cost recognised in the
            Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure account being equal to the contributions payable to the scheme.
            As the scheme is backed by the taxpayer there is no deficit liable to the University and no deficit recovery program and consequent
            liability placed upon the University.                                 
            (ii) The Universities Superannuation Scheme                           
            Brunel University London participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS - “The Scheme”) which is the main scheme
            covering most academic and professional level staff. The Scheme is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all
            members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
            USS is a multi-employer scheme and is accounted for as set out in the accounting policies.
            The total cost charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is £16.1m (2020–21 £15.2m) including PensionChoice, but
            excluding the impact of the change in the deficit recovery plan, as shown in note 23.
            Deficit recovery contributions due within 1 year for the university are £1.8m (2020-21 £4.2m).
            Since the University cannot identify its share of the Retirement Income Builder section of the Scheme assets and liabilities, the following
            disclosures reflect those relevant for the Scheme as a whole.         
            The 2020 valuation was the sixth valuation for USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004,
            which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical
            provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the assets of the Scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the Scheme’s technical
            provisions was £80.6 billion indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.
            The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the statement of funding principles
            (uss.co.uk/about-us/valuation-and-funding/statement-of-funding-principles).

      The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based on analysis of the scheme’s
      experience carried out as part of the 2020 actuarial valuation. The mortality assumptions used in these figures are as follows:

      A new deficit recovery plan was put into place as part of the 2020 valuation, which requires payment of 6.2% of salaries over the period
      1 April 2022 until 31 March 2024 at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%. The 2022 deficit recoverability liability reflects this plan. The
       liability figures have been produced using the following assumptions:

            33. Pension schemes (continued)                                       
            (iii) Local Government Pension Scheme – London Pensions Fund Authority (LPFA)
            The University participates as an Admitted Body in the LPFA which is administered in accordance with the Local Government Pensions
            Scheme Regulations 1997. The fund is valued every 3 years by actuaries, and the projected unit method is used in respect of the Active
            Sub-Fund in which the University participates. Each participating employer has their own contribution rate reflecting the long-term future
            service rate, adjusted for the funding level in respect of past service. For the year ended 31 March 2022, the employer’s contribution
            rate was 17.0% (17.0% March 21). However, the University was required to pay a lump sum of £1.06m in April 2022 (and £1.02m in April
            2021) in respect of past service benefits. The employee’s rate from 1 April 2011 is based on a banded earnings schedule. The employer
            contributions were £4.31m (£4.07m in 2021) and the employee’s contributions were £1.22m (£1.15m 2021).
            The following information regarding the LPFA is based on the full actuarial valuation of the fund as at 31 March 2019, rolled forward to 31
            March 2022 by Barnett Waddingham, an independent firm of actuaries. The major assumptions are:
                                        2022     2021    2020    2019    2018     
            Inflation (CPI)             2.75%   2.60%   2.20%    2.40%   2.35%    
            Rate of increase in salaries 3.65%  3.60%   3.20%    3.90%   3.85%    
            Rate of increase in pensions 2.75%  2.70%   2.20%    2.10%   2.35%    
            Discount rate               3.50%   1.60%    1.60%   2.10%   2.65%    
                                                                                  
            CMI2020 reflects the latest available industry data at the balance sheet date and was used in both 2020/21 and 2021/22. Further, the
            mortality assumption at 31 July 2022 does not reflect the potential reduction in pension liability because of COVID-19, given there remains
            uncertainty of the pandemic effect on long term mortality rates and currently do not have evidence for making such an assessment on
            longer term expectations. Therefore, a rate of 0% rather than 25% is applied to the 2020 mortality experience.
            The proposed assumptions for future mortality improvements can therefore be considered to lead to the best estimate of the future
            cashflows that will arise under the plan, consistent with the requirements of FRS102 28.16.
            The current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates. The assumed life expectations
            on retirement at age 65 are:

            • Members will exchange half of their commutable pension for cash at retirement
            • Members will retire at one retirement age for all tranches of benefit, the pension weighted average tranche retirement age. No
              members will take up the option under the new LGPS to pay 50% of contributions for 50% of benefits.

      Please note that he Experience gain/(loss) on defined benefit obligation of £12,526k includes the impact of emerging inflation since
      September 2021 which increases the scheme liabilities by £11,830k. Recent changes in global and UK economic pressures and tightening
      of monetary policy have had a significant impact on asset markets and corporate bonds yields, which are key to the FRS102 assessment of
      the net pension liability. In particular, AA corporate bond yields, used to set the FRS102 discount rate, have increased significantly since 31
      July 2022, with corresponding falls in asset values. The markets have been exceptionally volatile and therefore while both gross DBOs and
      assets will have fallen, it is difficult to estimate the impact of these changes on the net balance sheet position.

            Impact of the McCloud/Sargeant judgement on the reported LPFA pension liability
            On 27 June 2019 the Supreme Court denied the Government’s request for an appeal of the Court of Appeal’s judgement in McCloud/
            Sergeant case that transitional provisions introduced to the reformed judges and firefighters pension schemes in 2015 gave rise to
            unlawful age discrimination. The ruling relates to the transitional protection offered to some members – broadly those within 10 years of
            retirement age for the LGPS when the reformed schemes were introduced. The court had found that those too far away from retirement
            age to qualify for these transitional protections had been unfairly discriminated against. As transitional protection was offered to
            members of all the public service pension schemes, the government believes that the difference in treatment will need to be remedied
            across all of those schemes. This includes the LGPS scheme.           
            Allowance was made in the Financial Statements of 2018-19 for the estimated impact on the total liabilities as a result of this case. The
            adjustment was based on analysis carried out by the Government Actuary’s department (GAD) and the employer’s liability profile and
            allowances continue to be reflected thereafter in the financial statements.
