          About Birkbeck                                                          
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck is a unique London-based teaching and research institution providing access to evening
          higher education for non-traditional students of all ages. Most of our students are mature and
          have jobs, caring or other responsibilities during the day. The age of our students ranges from 18
          to 80 and our student body is diverse with 40% from BAME backgrounds and 58% women. As
          well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing international student community now
          welcoming students from 120 countries around the world.                 
                                                                                  
          Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that
          proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was very
          successful in the 2014 Research Assessment Exercise (REF) submitting 83% of eligible staff with
          approximately three-quarters of their research being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or
          ‘internationally excellent’ (3*). In terms of national higher education quality assessments, we are
          one of the minority of institutions that rate highly both for REF and for TEF, the teaching
          excellence framework.                                                   
          Response to the Covid pandemic                                          
                                                                                  
          The coronavirus pandemic hit all sectors of the UK economy in 2020 and changed the lives of
          billions of people worldwide. Our response, in finding effective new ways to work, operate and
          support students, is a testament to the determination and resilience of the whole Birkbeck
          community. I need to put on record my thanks to our staff for their dedication and hard work and
          to our students for their fortitude and commitment.                     
                                                                                  
          The safety of our staff and students has been paramount as we implemented revised policies
          and ways of working. In late March 2020 we moved all teaching online and moved swiftly to
          provide the means for staff to work predominantly from home. Of course, not all services and
          facilities can run online. Physical assets still need maintenance and ultimately online capacity
          relies on physical infrastructure. I need to particularly thank all those colleagues who continued
          to work onsite through a very challenging period to keep Birkbeck running, safe and secure, and
          able to support our staff and students in their work and study.         
                                                                                  
          Student Recruitment                                                     
                                                                                  
          How and in what way student recruitment would be impacted by the pandemic during 2020/21
          was a worrying question for all higher education institutions – but for Birkbeck particularly, given
          our very different demographic. Some of that difference seemed to offer cause for optimism, but
          in other areas deep concern. We modelled scenarios from a sharp decline to somewhere near
          the status quo of previous years. The immediate outcome was both surprising and positive.
          Applications reached their highest ever level, totalling 21,148. New admissions totalled 4,819
          FTE, the highest for a decade.                                          
          There were three of factors driving this result. Whilst for many the pandemic disrupted careers,
          livelihoods and businesses for others it also created time and opportunity to return to study.
          Many mature learners thinking about when to study, clearly brought forward and committed to
          those plans in 2020/21. There was also a significant EU effect with a rush to start programmes
          before the right to loan funding was removed. 2020/21 will be the final year that EU students will
          receive financial support for their studies. Whilst it was a pleasure to welcome EU students in
          numbers after a notable tailing off following the Referendum result, we fully expect recruitment to

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          fall drastically from 2021 onwards. Finally, we introduced a range of Masters courses with a later
          January start date to provide prospective students with greater choice and flexibility. These were
          well received and successful, accounting for around 100 FTE.            
                                                                                  
          However, it is now clear from recruitment in 2021/22, which has dipped significantly, that, for
          Birkbeck, the impact of Covid is playing out over not one but two and possibly more recruitment
          cycles. The latent demand fulfilled in 2020/21 has bolstered numbers in that year but seen them
          reduce in 2021/22. Whilst the impact of the funding changes for EU students was generally
          understood the ongoing pandemic has also led to changes in applicant behaviour. Improving
          student recruitment from the EU is a focus for us in the next few years.
          Finally, the pandemic has significantly intensified the competition for students in London. As
          circumstances have unfolded the largest institutions have been presented with the opportunity to
          significantly increase recruitment and have stuck to this strategy. Other institutions are
          competing under increasing pressure in this context. Birkbeck’s mature and commuter student
          focus is now the locus of intense competition. The imperative of responding strongly and
          effectively to this reality is a key part of both our longer-term strategic thinking and our
          immediate in-year planning.                                             
                                                                                  
          Teaching and learning                                                   
                                                                                  
          Having quickly dealt with the immediate issues brought about by lockdown we developed a
          Teaching Preparation Project (TPP) lead by the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education) with support from
          the ITS Digital Education Team. It was clear to us that irrespective of how other universities
          approached the Autumn term we would need to consider the unique make up of our student
          body whilst being flexible enough to be able to quickly respond to changing government
          guidelines.                                                             
                                                                                  
          Our objective for 2020/21 was to ensure that all students would be able to complete the whole
          year of their studies remotely if circumstances required it. The TPP project was a sustained
          institution-wide endeavour, delivered at pace and under a high degree of time and resource
          pressure. During the year 1,200 teaching modules were transformed for online delivery. Training
          and support was provided to 700 staff who were the front-line for this work.
          The move online was not a move to isolated individual study. Our model of higher education is
          not that. It centres on strong engagement between our staff and students in the classroom and
          strong peer to peer engagement between students as part of a positive learning community.
          Whilst we created digital content in new forms, a key part of our activity was to create the virtual
          classrooms that could continue to bring people together to learn and study, cutting through the
          isolation of the pandemic. Complimentary work was undertaken to support online assessment
          and examinations so students could continue to not only study but progress towards their
          intended qualifications. Exam hall anxiety was also reduced via online and remote examinations
          with submission windows of between 6 and 72 hours. Careful assessment design ensured
          academic standards were maintained and international students could study and be assessed
          across time zones. Regular student surveys throughout the year indicated widespread support for
          the College’s timely, inclusive and pragmatic approach.                 
                                                                                  
          Whilst the vast majority of teaching and assessment was successfully delivered online during
          2020/21, not everything can be done in this way. The College moved quickly to ensure essential
          access to teaching laboratories for students and access to the library were made available when
          it was safe to do so.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Student support                                                         
                                                                                  
          We were one of the first UK universities to introduce a no detriment assessment policy for our
          students. The policy ensured that students who attempted assessment and submitted on time
          were not disadvantaged by completing assessment during the period of Covid disruption and
          they did not need to submit a mitigating circumstances claim. The widespread stress and
          disruption was taken into account throughout the whole of our assessment and examining
          process. Students unable to complete an assessment, or who considered that their performance
          suffered as a direct result of significant personal or family illness, bereavement or serious
          personal, emotional or financial challenges, were able to submit a mitigating circumstances
          claim for sympathetic consideration by assessment boards.               
          We have also recognised that some of our students would not have access to suitable
          workspaces nor adequate digital hardware, software or skills. As well as opening up the library to
          support self-study as soon as possible, we made available funds to support students with
          financial hardship to purchase suitable IT equipment. To help transition new students to the
          world of on-line study and to maintain the services that current students need, we introduced a
          range of training sessions, support and orientation events. Outside of the classroom, investments
          were made in advice, mental health and student counselling as well as in the availability of
          e-books and learning resources to support the online offer.             
                                                                                  
          Although many of these interventions were developed to facilitate the move to on-line learning
          the rates of take-up may confirm that our busy commuter students are looking for on-demand
          services that wrap around work, caring and study time.                  
                                                                                  
          Research                                                                
                                                                                  
          The completion of the institutional submission for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) is
          always a major strategic undertaking for any research-intensive institution such as Birkbeck – let
          alone in the midst of a pandemic. The work in support of REF has been led by the Pro- Vice-
          Chancellor (Research) and involved major contributions of time and effort from some 113
          colleagues across the College.                                          
          Whilst the results of the REF can never be taken for granted, I am pleased to report that we have
          made a strong submission, reflecting the strength, breadth, and depth of our research across all
          disciplines. The later point is important. In line with the ambition we laid out after the 2014 REF,
          the College returned 100% of our 461 eligible staff to the exercise. This compared with 82% in
          the 2014 return. We made returns in 15 Units of Assessment, including two entered jointly with
          UCL.                                                                    
                                                                                  
          After the 2014 REF submission the College made changes to our research support structures to
          build for the 2021 submission. As a result, we have made progress in growing our external
          research income. Our grants portfolio - the total value of active awards - is the largest it has ever
          been at £56 million, compared to £44 million at this point in the 2014 cycle. The College’s
          success rate in grant applications is impressive, despite the intense competition for funding –
          36% for the last year for which full data is available.                 
                                                                                  
          The pandemic has restricted movement within the UK and abroad and many of our portfolio of
          research projects were placed on hold with funding bodies agreeing to no cost extensions. This
          has reduced the external research income recorded in our financial statements this year
          although the contribution to overheads is broadly similar to last year. 
                                                                                  
          We have sought to minimise disruption. We re-opened our research laboratories as soon as it

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          was safe to do so. In September, subject to Covid safety rules, staff could access their offices
          once again for material and resources vital for their research. Although international travel was
          restricted throughout the year, other activities such as participant testing began taking place
          once again.                                                             
          We have recognised that the disruption to research has impacted significantly on those at the
          start on their research careers and on women. We increased the size of our internal Research
          Innovation Fund as a way to support early career researchers. Academic colleagues have been
          able to access the fund for a range of needs, including the costs of childcare and to assist with
          their research during the second wave of coronavirus infections. We have also taken steps to
          mitigate Covid impacts in our promotion processes.                      
                                                                                  
          Supporting staff                                                        
                                                                                  
          We worked with our trade union colleagues to successfully launch a Jobs Protection Scheme in
          August 2020. The scheme focused on teaching and scholarship staff who lost some or part of
          their teaching for the 2020/21 academic year. The scheme included secondment opportunities
          to roles such as Digital Education Associates and redeployment options. We increased our focus
          on health and wellbeing in order to do our best to support our staff in a holistic way during the
          pandemic providing more support to address additional needs. We supported staff with school
          age children by encouraging line managers to offer flexible hours and remove any non-urgent
          work.                                                                   
                                                                                  
          The College acknowledged that staff had been challenged in different ways by working from
          home, so we supported management to improve the working from home experience (for those
          able to work from home). We liaised with the College Health and Safety Advisor about virtual DSE
          assessments and took particular care for staff deemed clinically extremely vulnerable and
          introduced Occupational Health assessments for such staff to determine their suitability for
          returning to work on campus and for reasonable adjustments for staff with disabilities. We also
          made limited work spaces available at the College. In recognition of the critical Birkbeck workers
          required to work on site during the three periods of lockdown between March 2020 and April
          2021, we introduced a disruption allowance. We produced bespoke guidance for managers and
          staff on returning to work on campus and developed two online training sessions providing
          guidance, context and frameworks for managers needing to support their direct reports to be
          able to return to work on campus.                                       
          Regular communications in Inside the Birkbeck Community about health and wellbeing included
          details of the newly appointed Employee Assistance Programme, yoga and stretch sessions, and
          other valuable resources for support.                                   
                                                                                  
          The development of the estate                                           
                                                                                  
          This year I am pleased to report that the College completed two keynote estate developments –
          again achieved against the backdrop of Covid disruption. They go to the heart of our mission –
          support for the highest quality research and support for our students and the best conditions for
          teaching and learning.                                                  
                                                                                  
          The Wohl Wolfson ToddlerLab will enable researchers to track childhood development seamlessly
          over the first five years of life and will look for ways that conditions such as autism and ADHD can
          be discovered earlier. Linked to the work of our existing BabyLab, the ToddlerLab is the first
          centre of its kind in the world. The new building spans five floors and houses a virtual reality
          environment, a pre-school environment, a home front-room environment, and ‘the Exploration
          Lab’, a suite dedicated to developing behavioural interventions.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          373 Euston Road is our new teaching and learning building. Set over seven storeys, the building-
          provides a range of teaching, learning and social spaces including: classrooms; a student lounge
          and café; and social learning areas. It also has a striking 180-seat copper clad lecture theatre
          with terrace at roof level. It has also been designed and fitted out to a high standard with the
          latest IT and AV equipment. It is a clear statement of intent in terms of the facilities we are
          committed to providing for our students.                                
          Finally, I am pleased to report that just prior to the end of the financial year we successfully
          acquired the Student Central Building on a 99-year lease. Student Central is next door to our
          main Malet Street building so it provides a transformational opportunity to improve and increase
          our teaching, learning and student social and communal space at the heart of our campus in
          Bloomsbury. It will increase our campus space by around 25%, it will enable students to connect,
          engage and participate inside and outside classrooms in ways in which we have not been able to
          facilitate in the past, allowing them to maximise the benefit from their time with us.
                                                                                  
          Current Operating Position                                              
                                                                                  
          Whilst the financial results for 2020/21 are positive, and certainly far better than our initial
          forecasting and scenario planning suggested, it is important to reflect on the fact that the
          pandemic also interrupted the second year of the College recovery plan. 
                                                                                  
          Following a number of years of healthy surpluses, exceeding 5% of turnover each year since
          2010, the College made a deficit of £0.9 million in 2017/18 (after adjusting for a one-off
          equipment grant, restructuring costs and other gains and losses) and an underlying deficit of
          £5.0 million in 2018/19. Whilst the College returned to a £1.9 million underlying surplus in
          2019/20, some £1.4 million was attributable to reduced expenditure through the initial months
          of the pandemic.                                                        
                                                                                  
          When we compare our financial profile to that of obvious comparators (medium institutions with
          turnover of £100 to £250 million, top quartile research ambitions and at or close to TEF gold) we
          are at the small end of such institutions. Owing to our London location we have higher cost
          pressures especially relating to estates and staff. Furthermore, our unique mode of delivery and
          student body adds major complexity and constraint to our underlying business model. Provision
          at the heart of a capital city, predominantly delivered in the evening to allow students to pursue
          other activities in the day, compresses our core income-generating teaching activity to limited
          hours in term time. Our students also have more and more complex needs which must be
          addressed.                                                              
          The impact of lower student income following Brexit and increased competition across London,
          together with higher staff costs have significantly impacted our financial position. Annual
          increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and
          pension costs) exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the
          fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of
          5% of income eroded post-Brexit but without significant remedial action these deficits will grow
          as the gap between staff costs and tuition income widens.               
                                                                                  
          Looking Forward                                                         
                                                                                  
          The College will endorse a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26 this year. This will take us to,
          and through, our 200th anniversary. It will pick up the difficult challenges we faced prior to the
          pandemic as well as build on the lessons learnt and strides forward we have made in responding
          to it. It builds on spring and summer Governors’ discussions, a positive and extensive internal
          consultation process involving staff and students, and a concerted analysis of Birkbeck’s position
          in the sector and the London HE market.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The government’s proposals around introducing a Lifelong learning Entitlement on the basis of
          flexible modularised funding from 2025 are a game changing opportunity for our access and
          lifelong learning mission, but we need to respond rapidly to benefit.   
                                                                                  
          The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental challenges for the College as it is
          currently understood, in particular for financial sustainability, market position and teaching
          competitiveness, and the ability to maintain research intensity. The strategy proposes to re-
          establish clear ground for Birkbeck as the standout institution for highly flexible, high quality
          teaching which delivers lifelong learning and supports social mobility. The quality of our teaching
          will be reinforced by targeted investment in our world-leading research areas and a renewed
          ‘connected campus’ environment which will instil a sense of pride and belonging in staff and
          students.                                                               
          Delivering this repositioning will involve a fundamental revision of our underlying operational and
          teaching delivery models, creating the greater degree of standardisation in mode of teaching
          delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and support
          student success: addressing competitiveness will also involve the major efficiency gains that are
          necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.               
                                                                                  
          With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22, Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges
          which make the route to these strategic objectives narrower and steeper. We are identifying the
          immediate actions whose delivery can be geared in such a way as to deliver significant short-
          term gains in terms of efficiency and income generation. These actions are being drawn together
          in a short-term recovery plan nested within the overall 2021-26 strategy and constituting the first
          stages of strategy implementation.                                      
                                                                                  
          This plan focuses on the following interlocking initiatives:            
                                                                                  
                •  an immediate building back of recruitment in 2022/23, involving not only some
                   changes in tactics and management of the campaign, but also change in our
                   student facing offer;                                          
                                                                                  
                •  the launch of a more competitive flexible Birkbeck offer, in particular at
                   undergraduate level, for autumn 2023 entry;                    
                                                                                  
                •  the rollout of new simplified teaching models for undergraduate and postgraduate
                   provision that are both more effective and efficient;          
                •  support for departmental workload models that allow the College to address issues
                   and mismatches of workload and resource equitably; and         
                                                                                  
                •  optimising the support students get outside the classroom by reviewing and
                   restructuring across the board arrangements for student facing administration
                   services and support.                                          
                                                                                  
          2022 is set to be a challenging year in delivering the above, but also potentially a foundational
          one. The interventions we need to make now are driven by immediate challenge, but are crucially
          the necessary first steps to providing a sustainable institution able to succeed in the future.

          Birkbeck provides its unique learning and teaching environment in the context of a research
          intensive, outward facing and publically engaged institution. It is pleasing to be able to report that
          Birkbeck staff, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged for their contribution in various
          fields and this year has been no exception. The following are examples of awards and honours
          received during the year.                                               
          The 2020 European Criminology Award of the European Society of Criminology for lifetime
          contribution to criminology was awarded to Professor Mike Hough, Emeritus Professor, School of
          Law for his significant contribution to European criminology. The European Society of Criminology
          (ESC) is a scientific institution founded under the Literary and Scientific Institutions Act 1854 and
          has as one of its objectives: to foster criminological scholarship, research, education and training
          within academic institutions.                                           
                                                                                  
          Professor Hough was also the recipient of this year’s Outstanding Achievement award from the
          British Society of Criminology (BSC) in recognition of his long contribution to bringing academic
          and policy research together. He founded one of the major UK centres for academic policy
          research on criminal justice - the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research (ICPR) which is now
          part of the Birkbeck Law School – and served as its Director for more than 20 years before
          retiring recently. Prior to joining academia in 1994 he was a senior researcher in the Home
          Office.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          Professor Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck, was
          awarded the Royal Astronomical Society’s Service Award for his leading role in the promotion of
          lunar science and human space exploration both within the UK and internationally. Professor
          Crawford has had a long and illustrious career in the field championing the need for deeper
          research into the Moon at a time when it was not at the forefront of scientists’ interests. Over the
          past 20 years he has been involved in developing science planning for space mission designs
          such as the UK MoonLITE, ESA MoonNext and the International Lunar Network proposals.
          Professor Crawford has also played a leading role in several lunar scientific experiments and has
          supervised 11 PhD theses in lunar science and astrobiology. Many of his students have gone on
          to play leading roles in the science community. In August 2020 Professor Crawford was also
          appointed as a member of the UK Space Agency’s Space Exploration Advisory Committee.
          Professor Sanjib Bhakta, Professor of Molecular Microbiology and Biochemistry, and Sreyashi
          Basu were jointly awarded the 2020 Microbiology Outreach Prize by the Microbiology Society, for
          effectively bridging the gap between laboratory science and public health research with their
          project ‘Joi Hok!’, a community tuberculosis (TB) awareness programme. The programme’s aim is
          to alter the perception of TB among the local community in Kolkata, India, through a network of
          local artists, musicians and health professionals. Traditional art forms and music are used to
          communicate knowledge of TB, educating young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds
          about the disease through workshops which take place in semi urban and rural schools. The
          Microbiology Society is a membership charity for scientists interested in microbes, their effects
          and their practical uses, and is one of the largest microbiology societies in Europe.
                                                                                  
          Professor Kevin Ibeh, Professor of Marketing and International Business and Pro Vice-Chancellor
          (International) at Birkbeck was appointed a Commissioner of the Commonwealth Scholarship
          Commission (CSC), an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Foreign,
          Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Professor Ibeh, joins 14 other CSC
          commissioners and a Chair who are charged with managing and governing the UK’s contribution
          to the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP). Through overseeing the yearly
          award of around 750 postgraduate scholarships and professional development fellowships to

          Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to
          operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which
          rewards staff in line with the College commitment to equality and diversity. The Gender Pay Gap
          report is produced each year as part of our ongoing commitment to monitor gender equality and
          diversity pay issues in our workforce. We have been publishing equal pay audits since 2009 and
          continue this practice in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific
          Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on certain metrics
          annually.                                                               
                                                                                  
          In addition to the mandatory annual Gender Pay Gap report, Birkbeck also undertakes a full pay
          audit periodically (most recent 2020) to provide analysis and recommendations in relation to
          reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the institution. This
          report considers the pay of staff with other protected characteristics.

          Birkbeck first reported gender pay in 2003 when the mean gender pay gap was 16.9%. This has
          halved to its current level through a combination of policy intervention and raising awareness.
          The Universities & Colleges Employers Association compiled and published the 2018/19 gender
          pay data for the sector in April 2020. Using this benchmark we were ranked 19th of 122
          employers for most equitable mean gender pay gap and 40th for most equitable median gender
          pay gap. We remain committed to further progress on equal pay and have set out both an action
          plan and monitoring targets.

          Table 2: Gender pay gap – bonus pay                                     
          Birkbeck makes a relatively low number of bonus payments in comparison to the wider sector -
          the sector average is 6.8% of staff receiving a bonus payment, at Birkbeck it is 1.8%. We operate
          a number of contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different conditions
          required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to demonstrate
          excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal circumstances and all
          members of the committees tasked with reviewing applications undertake both formal equality &
          diversity and unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is annually reviewed by the College
          for equality & diversity issues in application and success rates.       
                                                                                  
          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal
          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the
          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted
          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena
          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances. For example, the
          academic promotion schemes were modified and this has resulted in an increased application
          and promotion rate of women to more senior academic roles. Work continues on this issue.
                                                                                  
          The College Equal Pay Audit 2020 examines gender but also includes analyses of pay gaps by
          ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. The full report, which includes actions and benchmark

          Facility time under the Trade Union Regulations 2017 for the relevant period from 1 April 2020
          to 31 March 2021                                                        
                                                                                  
          The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
          April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
          range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility time is the
          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Chart 2: Summary of activities to be supported by donations             
                                                                                  
          In addition to supporting the College financially, every year our alumni and friends play an
          important role in aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives. Last year was
          no different, despite volunteering initiatives being provided exclusively on-line. 460 students
          (2019/20: 515 students) benefited from the support, guidance and advice given by 268
          volunteers (2019/20: 324 volunteers) who gave a total of 4,500 hours of their time (2019/20:
          5,050 hours).                                                           
          Whilst the pandemic has caused adverse circumstances and uncertainty for so many of our
          students, staff, alumni and donors, it has shown the real and pressing need for flexible support.
          We are confident that our community will continue to come together to provide vital funding and
          expertise to ensure that Birkbeck students and researchers continue to have access to the tools,
          support and services that enable them to thrive.                        
                                                                                  
          As we move towards our 200th anniversary in 2023, our alumni and supporters will be vital in
          helping us to achieve our ambitious strategic priorities. Hundreds have already shown their
          support by engaging with the #OurBirkbeck initiative, launched last year to celebrate and
          showcase the impact members of our community have around the world.     
                                                                                  
          In December 2021, Birkbeck will launch The World Needs More Birkbeck, a comprehensive
          fundraising and engagement campaign. The Campaign will look to deepen our relationships with
          current supporters and attract new donors to support Birkbeck's ambitions across four key areas;
          widening access to education; supporting our students; advancing world-leading research; and
          ensuring state-of-the-art infrastructure and estates.                   
                                                                                  
          As the new academic year begins I am pleased to reflect on the remarkable ways in which the
          College community has worked together to support each other to address and overcome the
          unprecedented and unpredictable challenges that Covid has presented over the past year and a
          half or so. There will undoubtedly continue to be many more challenges ahead as we look to
          bounce back from the fall in student numbers in the second year of the pandemic. Birkbeck, like
          other Universities up and down the country, has been through a tumultuous period caused by the
          pandemic.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          In 2023 we will celebrate our 200th anniversary. In 1823 our philanthropist founder Dr George
          Birkbeck set out his vision: ‘Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of
          knowledge.’ This statement continues to underpin our mission and the connections we have
          made between work, study, culture, research and society. As we move into a post-pandemic,
          post-Brexit world and approach our third century we will continue to offer transforming
          educational opportunities, in the belief that there should be no barriers, financial, practical or
          otherwise, to the benefits of university education. We will work closely with employers and
          government to assist with the up-skilling and re-skilling of individuals which will be vital to the
          recovery of the regional and national economy. Within an increasingly volatile operating
          environment, we will maintain and develop our distinctive research culture and contribution to
          science and society and we will create more and better space and facilities for all of our
          activities.

          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in
          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard
          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore,
          has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are
          prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed
          assets and derivative financial instruments).                           
          The Covid pandemic has had a significant effect on families, businesses and economies across
          the world. Education has been curtailed during the period of lockdown and examinations have
          been severely disrupted. This has led to direct and indirect financial consequences for UK
          universities including Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.
                                                                                  
          At the start of the pandemic we acknowledged that the virus would create disruption and
          uncertainty so adapted both the management accounts for the year and the future forecasts.
          Although focus would need to be shifted to dealing with the immediate issues thrown up by the
          pandemic it was also important to maintain progress against towards our longer-term objectives.
          This Financial Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial impact of
          the pandemic. Comment will also be provided on pension and other adjustments which
          contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and capital expenditure.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The recurrent teaching grant from the government has been falling steadily since undergraduate
          tuition fees were increased in 2012 and fell by a further £0.3 million in 2020/21. Teaching grant
          now represents only 3.6% of College income in comparison with 47.5% in 2005/06. The Office
          for Students has removed the London weighting element from the grant for 2021/22 as
          government funding priorities were shifted to support their levelling up agenda. This will almost
          halve the teaching grant the College will receive in 2021/22 in comparison with 2020/21.
          In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to 63.7% in 2020/21.
          Tuition income rose by £8.0 million in 2020/21 compared with the previous year, a direct
          consequence of the pandemic which led to significant increases in Home students and the final
          year of UK government funded loans for students from the European Union. Although
          applications from international students remained buoyant (up 9.4% on the previous year), Covid
          travel restrictions limited enrolments to a 3.0% rise. Unfortunately, the Covid and Brexit spikes of
          2020/21 appear not to have been replicated in 2021/22 despite a similar total number of
          applications being received. This is discussed further in the Risk Management section.
                                                                                  
          Recurrent grant from Research England rose by £1.2 million in 2020/21, an increase of 11.9%.
          External research activity remained affected by the pandemic restrictions and we were unable to
          recognise income from research grants and contracts to the same extent as in previous years
          with a further fall of £0.1 million compared with 2019/20. Research students have also
          struggled to complete their fieldwork and the College has committed to match the approach of
          research councils by providing financial support to those self-funding students needing to extend
          their programmes by a year.                                             
                                                                                  
          Whilst the majority of academic and professional support staff across the College were able to
          work from home successfully a small number of research, nursery, cleaning and facilities staff
          could not. These staff were furloughed but continued to receive full salary. In line with the
          guidelines for universities £539,000 (2019/20: £350,000) was claimed from the Coronavirus
          Job Retention Scheme as a contribution towards the salaries of the furloughed staff. This is
          included in Other Income.                                               
          As an evening provider of higher education Birkbeck rents much of its space to other universities
          during the daytime and rents space from them in the evening to support the teaching of its own
          students. With lockdown and ongoing safety restrictions limiting the activities which could take
          place on campus throughout the year, we saw a further fall in Other Income from £11.8 million in
          2018/19 (the last full year pre-pandemic) to £8.2 million in 2020/21 (having removed the
          income from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme received this year). This fall in income was
          primarily related to a decrease in room bookings income (£2.6 million below £2018/19),
          catering and conferences (£1.2 million below 2018/19).                  
                                                                                  
          In July 2021 the College sold its share of University Square Stratford to the University of East
          London (UEL) for £5.8 million resulting in a profit on sale of asset of £3.7 million. It had become
          increasingly clear to us that our outreach activities in the London Borough of Newham could be
          delivered successfully without the need to own property in the area. As the majority user of the
          Stratford property, UEL were keen to expand their programme offering into the space previously
          used by Birkbeck and offered to buy our share.                          
                                                                                  
          Governors finalised a new investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support our core
          business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our estates
          strategy. It also includes the College's approach to Responsible Investment. Independent advice
          on investment manager selection, which particularly focussed on Environmental, Social and
          Governance criteria, was provided by Mercer and in the autumn of 2020 our investment funds

          *Undergraduate degree with a foundation year studied in a full-time mode
          The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since 2011/12 appears to have
          plateaued. After much lobbying by the College since the undergraduate fee was increased in
          2012, we welcomed the Government’s announcement in October 2020 that it is to create a new
          four-year lifelong learning allowance and to provide loans for students to cover the fees of
          studying on short courses. We continue to reinforce the need to abolish the rule that prevents
          someone from studying a higher education qualification that is at the same level or lower than
          those that they already have (ELQ). Re-skilling and up-skilling of the UK workforce will be critical
          for post-pandemic, post-Brexit economic recovery.                       
          Our strategy to introduce full-time programmes has compensated for the part-time fall as can be
          seen in Chart 5. More recently, we enhanced our access routes to higher education for students
          without traditional qualifications by introducing a degree with foundation year route. Recruitment
          increased dramatically again in 2020/21 (up 288 FTE) giving students an opportunity to

          commence a university programme which might otherwise have been denied to them.
          Competition for undergraduate students in London is increasing and despite the unusual A level
          results process in August 2020 we managed to maintain numbers despite some other
          universities in Bloomsbury increasing substantially.                    
          Chart 6 starkly demonstrates the significant impact that Brexit has had on the recruitment of EU
          nationals to the College. Numbers fell by 18.4% in 2017/18 (the first full recruitment cycle after
          the referendum) and a further 12.2% in 2018/19. Despite ongoing pandemic travel restrictions
          EU numbers increased by 146 in 2020/21 as students took advantage of the final year of loan
          support from the UK government. The removal of these loans requires EU domiciled students to
          fund their programmes at the point of study and has led to a further significant fall in numbers
          starting programmes at Birkbeck in 2021/22.

          Chart 6: Impact of Brexit on recruitment of students from the EU        
          In 2016/17, postgraduate recruitment showed a marked increase (Chart 5) due to the
          introduction of the postgraduate loan. Full-time numbers then fell slightly in 2017/18, partly due
          to the fall in EU students but also due to increased competition as more institutions advertised
          the new student loan which had originally been announced close to the start of the 2016/17
          academic year. Recruitment has increased steadily since then with postgraduate enrolments in
          2019/20 representing an increase of 30.6% over 2015/16 which was the final year pre-loans.
          Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this
          occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown
          restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters
          programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to
          upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-
          Brexit) recovery. Unfortunately, far lower 2021/22 recruitment appears to indicate that latent
          demand was met last year possibly coupled with a focus on employment rather than study as
          London begins to recover.

          Income from full-time Home and EU students increased by £5.3 million as a consequence of the
          Covid postgraduate increase and the final year of loans for EU students. Income from
          international students rose by £0.9 million (an increase of 9.4%) despite the considerable travel
          challenges faced by many students during 2020/21. International student income has steadily
          grown over the last five years as we have placed more emphasis on international brand
          management and awareness. We believe that there is scope for further increases, particularly
          with the re-introduction of the post-study work visa. Income from part-time students rose by £2.1
          million – the third year-on-year increase since the dramatic fall in numbers from 2012. It is
          hoped that developing Government policy with the extension of student loans to short courses
          will provide the part-time market with overdue reinvigoration.

          Staff costs as a percentage of total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and
          restructuring costs) has been rising consistently over a number of years and has become
          unsustainable. In general, restructuring costs should be included in this metric but are excluded
          from Table 3 to remove the increased sum paid in 2018/19 thereby allowing for better year on
          year comparison. The College does not own any student residences (which increase income
          without a corresponding increase in staff costs) so this percentage remains one of the highest in
          the sector.

          Tuition fees and education contracts provided 68.3% of total income in 2020/21 (2019/20:
          66.6%) whilst staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) represent 64.0% of total
          income (2019/20: 68.0%). With undergraduate fees fixed by the UK government and upwards
          pressure on staff costs, particularly through pension contribution increases, there is a mismatch
          between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff costs. Until 2017/18, the
          trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs and the College
          delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit fall in students enrolling from the EU coupled with
          increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 9 and directly led to the
          underlying deficit in 2018/19. In 2019/20, lower staff costs following the VSER scheme coupled
          with increased student income brought the two lines closer together and we have seen a
          significant switch in 2020/21 due to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition income.
          Unfortunately, as we ease our way out of the pandemic new student enrolments have fallen and
          the implications of a switch back to staff costs exceeding tuition income in 2021/22 needs
          careful consideration as we develop our new five-year strategy.         
          The coronavirus pandemic required us to quickly move activity on-line for both staff and students
          in the Spring of 2020 and education remained largely on-line throughout 2020/21. When
          College buildings began to open in-line with government guidelines, most staff and students
          continued to work remotely. Despite the significant changes the transition was successful and we
          saw an increase in student retention in 2020/21. However, both income and costs were
          affected. It is difficult to ascertain exactly what the financial impact in 2020/21 has been but a
          comparison of performance against the original underlying break-even budget for various
          activities can provide some indicators.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          As can be seen from Table 4, the positive underlying performance is largely a combination of
          pandemic related factors (increased income coupled with lower costs) which are unlikely to be
          replicated as restrictions ease and the economy recovers. Although costs were lower, the savings
          were not directly related to the delivery of teaching with staff costs exceeding budget due to
          investment in staff to support the on-line development and delivery of programmes.
          In addition, we had three very specific material adjustments which helped boost the
          comprehensive income by £10.6 million: a one-off property sale; growth in investments from an
          initial pandemic fall in global equities; plus £2.3 million in donations which were received over
          the last few years but under accounting rules could only be recorded as income once our specific
          obligations had been delivered (completion of Toddlerlab and 373 Euston Road).
                                                                                  
          The comprehensive income achieved in 2020/21 of £18.0 million is not dissimilar to the
          2019/20 figure of £19.0 million. However, it is important to look beyond these figures to the
          major contributing factors as shown in Table5.

          * It should be noted that nearly all of our activities were impacted by Covid during 2020/21 so it is
          difficult to accurately assess the direct financial impact. The Covid estimate is the sum of the first five
          entries in Table 4 to give a guide but the figure could easily be higher.
                                                                                  
          Although difficult to ascertain exactly, it does appear that our underlying financial position
          continued to improve in 2020/21 from the post-referendum lows. However, the pandemic
          prevented us from reducing costs in a couple of academic departments with particularly low staff
          student ratios and this will need to be a focus in 2021/22.             
          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2017 with the effect
          that the scheme deficit increased. A repayment plan was agreed in 2018/19 and the College
          recognised the increase in its share of the pension liability. This had the effect of reducing total
          comprehensive income for the year by £20.7 million. A joint Expert Panel (JEP) was set up with
          members representing employers and members to review the assumptions used in the valuation.
          A follow up valuation was undertaken at 31 March 2018 using slightly amended assumptions
          recommended by the JEP. These assumptions led to a reduction in the scheme deficit and a
          recovery plan with a slightly extended repayment period. The resulting impact on the College total
          comprehensive income was an increase of £14.9 million.                  
                                                                                  
          It was agreed that a third valuation at 31 March 2020 should be undertaken and this was
          commenced despite the pandemic impact on equities. The valuation increased the deficit
          position significantly to retain existing retirement benefits and contribution rates would have
          moved to unaffordable levels to repair the position. Benefit reforms were proposed which only

           at 31 July                                                             
                                                                                  
          Table 6: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)      
                                                                                  
          The contribution rates from October 2021 and the resulting College share of the liability at 31
          July 2022 assume that the benefit reforms being consulted on are implemented from April 2022.
          If for any reason benefit reform is delayed a revised set of contribution rates will be implemented
          which result in further increases for staff and employers every six months from April 2022 to
          October 2025. From April 2022 the employer contribution rate will increase to 23.7% (an
          additional 2.3%) and members 11.0% (an additional 1.2%). If benefit reform is not implemented
          by 2025 the corresponding rates will be set at 38.2% for employers and 18.8% for members.
          Without benefit reform the College share of the liability at 31 July 2022 is estimated to be £78.5
          million.                                                                
                                                                                  
          The University and Colleges Union (UCU) balloted for strike action over pay and pensions and is
          asking employers not to implement benefit reforms. Although most employers, including
          Birkbeck, have stated that they cannot afford to increase contribution rates further the Pensions
          Regulator has clearly stated that it expects the 2020 valuation to be concluded as it is already
          past the statutory deadline. Given the affordability challenge for employers and the pressure
          from the regulator it is difficult to see how a negotiated settlement could be reached with UCU
          before April 2022.                                                      
          As can be seen from Table 6, the Universities Superannuation Scheme has become more costly
          and represented 7.1% of income in 2020/21 (6.6% of total income 2017/18). Deficit recovery
          contributions of 6.3% of payroll are now required and the College share of the liability has
          increased by £37.8 million in four years. It is hoped that possible strike action will not lead to the
          imposition of further rate increases from April 2022 and that ways to ensure that the scheme
          becomes financially sustainable are identified before the 2023 valuation. Governors are
          concerned about the risk the scheme now places on the financial health of the College.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Although we saw a spike in tuition income in 2020/21 total income has been reasonably static
          over the last few years. Staff costs inflate each year due to pay inflation, incremental drift and
          promotions with National Insurance and pension contribution increases also adding to the
          pressure. The challenge of managing rising costs with a fixed annual income is a cycle we need
          to try and break.                                                       
          The increased total comprehensive income in 2020/21 contributed £10.9 million in operating
          cash (2019/20: £2.3 million). This cash inflow coupled with cash reserves allowed us to
          purchase Student Central (now referred to as Birkbeck Central) from the University of London for
          £35 million. The purchase of Birkbeck Central coupled with continued investment in other capital
          estates projects, IT infrastructure and equipment has led to a significant increase in non-current
          assets and a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents. Net liquidity days fell this
          year to 50 (in highly simplistic terms the number of days we can pay for goods and services
          without further income). It is worth noting, however, that in addition to the instant access cash we
          also held £23.4 million of long-term investments – invested in two funds with Mercer and Ruffer.
          Each of these funds generate investment income and are reasonably liquid (7 days).
                                                                                  
          Having used our cash reserves to invest in fixed assets the ratio of long-term investments to total
          investments has nearly doubled this year to 62.2% (2019/20: 32.7%). It is helpful that the long-
          term investments can be readily divested and our cash flows are constantly monitored. In
          October 2021 the College Investment Committee chose to realise the gains made on the funds
          and reduced the capital invested back to £20 million.                   
                                                                                  
          To help manage our liquidity in the period following the purchase of Birkbeck Central, and to
          contribute towards the costs of refurbishment, a £20 million Revolving Credit Facility was
          arranged with Barclays Bank prior to 31 July 2021. At the year-end it had not been necessary to
          draw down any of the loan funding.                                      
                                                                                  
          Risk Management                                                         
          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the College as an essential element of
          corporate governance. The College has adopted a financially prudent and conservative approach
          but is nevertheless committed to pursuing strategic opportunities linked to its core mission,
          provided that the potential benefits and risks are understood and that reasonable means to
          mitigate risks are put in place. Good progress has been made towards embedding risk
          management throughout the College. The College provided a full compliance statement on
          internal control last year and will continue to do so.                  
                                                                                  
          The College has a Risk Management Policy in place which explains the underlying approach to
          risk management and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit
          Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Risk Management Group and other key
          parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk management process and identifies the main
          reporting procedures. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis.        
                                                                                  
          The Risk Register is compiled by the Risk Management Group consisting of senior academic and
          professional services staff. Significant current and potential future risks are identified and
          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. The risks are grouped by themes,
          for which Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic objectives have been established. The
          risks are monitored by Strategic Planning Committee, Audit Committee and Governors. An annual
          report on internal control and risk for 2020/21 was presented to the Audit Committee in May
          2021.                                                                   
                                                                                  
          In the Spring of 2020, KPMG undertook a scheduled review of strategic risk management at the
          College as part of their internal audit plan for the year. The work to be undertaken was

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          summarised in their report as follows:                                  
                                                                                  
          “We will undertake deep dives into a sample of the strategic risks recorded on the risk register in
          order to assess the effectiveness of their management to achieve a tolerable level of risk. We will
          consider whether mitigations implemented are appropriate to address the nature of the risk
          identified, whether actions identified have been implemented as planned and whether they have
          been effective in reducing the level of risk to an acceptable level.    
          We will also review the governance structures in place for the oversight and monitoring of the
          risks identified to consider whether they are sufficient to provide assurance to the Governors that
          risks are being effectively managed.”                                   
                                                                                  
          A number of areas of good practice were identified in their May 2020 report and an assurance
          rating of “significant assurance with minor improvement opportunities” was determined.
                                                                                  
          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls and net scores take into account
          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  
                                                                                  
          The top risks for the College for 2020/21 outlined in the annual report are:
                                                                                  
            •  Student recruitment falls                                          
                                                                                  
               Gross risk 22.50, residual risk 15.00 (2019/20: gross risk 22.50; residual risk 15.00)
                                                                                  
               Our financial sustainability is heavily linked to student recruitment reflecting our reliance
               on tuition fees as our main source of income. Although the risk level has not changed
               across the last two years we have seen a marked change in applicant behaviour. We were
               concerned that recruitment for 2020/21 would fall due to travel and other restrictions
               related to the pandemic but this did not materialise and we saw a spike in enrolments.
               Having modelled flat year-year-on-year recruitment of new students for 2021/22 we
               retained the risk level due to ongoing pandemic uncertainty.       
               Despite receiving the same number of applications in both 2020/21 and 2021/22,
               conversion from offer to enrolment dropped significantly this year such that tuition
               income is expected to be around £10 million below budget. In the first half of the
               recruitment cycle applications were up year-on-year but late summer applications from
               more mature students, usually our strongest recruitment period, fell away significantly.
               The continuing use of teacher assessed A levels polarised the sector with Russell Group
               universities increasing numbers at the expense of others with very few students needing
               to accept their insurance offers.                                  
                                                                                  
               Work has already commenced to boost our marketing and conversion activity for
               2022/23 and longer-term recovery strategies are being developed. Application and offer
               statistics will be monitored weekly by the Recruitment Strategy and Management Group
               and further mitigating actions will be developed during the year.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
               Similar to the student recruitment risk, risk scores for financial sustainability were not
               updated for the May annual report to Audit Committee as applications and offers were
               above the previous year and the pandemic uncertainty remained. The significant drop in
               conversion in 2021/22 has led to a £10 million loss of income against an underlying
               provisional surplus for the year of £1.0 million. A number of early reductions to
               expenditure budgets have been identified which reduce the forecast underlying deficit for
               the year to £3.0 million. Future year income will also be affected as reduced size cohorts
               replace larger graduating groups.                                  
               Audit Committee and Finance & General Purposes Committee reviewed a series of papers
               in November 2021 outlining a recovery strategy and the impact of the loss of income and
               plans of our financial forecasts. Although we can expect deficits for the next couple of
               years the recovery strategy outlines a credible way forward which includes refocussing
               our programme portfolio and the way we deliver teaching. These coupled objectives are
               based on a review of internal metrics and external market data and aim to make sure
               that we deliver high quality programmes for working students. They will also allow us to
               build on our long-standing objective of offering a lifelong learning opportunity to students
               needing to upskill and reskill throughout their careers.           
                                                                                  
               The deterioration in our financial position in 2021/22 will increase the range of risks we
               face as we seek to quickly implement our recovery strategy. Strategic Planning
               Committee and Governors will continue to formally review progress against timelines and
               objectives. We are also developing new delivery and governance groups, which will
               include independent governors, to ensure that we remain on track. Finance & General
               Purposes Committee determined that the College would remain a going concern having
               reviewed the forecasts and associated papers at their November meeting.
                                                                                  
            •  Breach of IT or data security                                      
                                                                                  
               Gross risk 22.50, residual risk 14.00 (2019/20: gross risk 18.00; residual risk 12.25)
               This risk has been raised once again to reflect the increase in malicious activity targeted
               at the education sector. Audit Committee has been focussing on both cyber security and
               data protection and a number of projects were commenced prior to the pandemic. These
               included working towards implementing recommendations to improve compliance under
               GDPR legislation following an internal audit, introducing mandatory IT security training for
               all staff, improving security in our email systems and enhancing infrastructure and
               hardware. This is likely to remain a significant risk indefinitely due to the adaptability of
               those looking to breach security arrangements.                     
                                                                                  
          To recognise the highly uncertain period we are in due to the pandemic a number of additional
          groups have been set up to monitor the developing situation and agree on mitigating actions
          including: The Vice-Chancellor chairs weekly meetings of the Academic Executive Team and
          senior College staff brief the Chairs of the Governing Body committees on a regular basis
          between formal meetings. Other College committees such as the Health & Safety Committee
          have also been meeting more frequently. Further groups will be formed to oversee the delivery
          and oversight of the projects which underpin our recovery strategy.     
                                                                                  
          The future of higher education funding and the affordability/sustainability of the Universities
          Superannuation Scheme are each risks with significantly uncertain outcomes which could have a
          detrimental impact on the College in the future. We are unable to actively mitigate these risks
          and can only lobby government or contribute to sector-wide consultations. Nevertheless, reports
          on the possible impact on the College and associated risks are routinely prepared and discussed
          at Strategic Planning Committee and with Governors.

          The College Charter dated 17 March 1926 states:                         
                                                                                  
          “The objects of the College shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons
          who are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
          instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in all or
          any of the subjects comprised in the faculties of the University into which the College has been or
          may be admitted and any other subjects as the Governors may from time to time determine.”
          As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
          required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Act describes 13
          broad areas of charitable activity. The Governing Body has regard to the Charity Commission’s
          guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in the following manner.
                                                                                  
          The advancement of education                                            
                                                                                  
          The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
          the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   
                                                                                  
          The College Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins
          everything we do.                                                       
                                                                                  
          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
          the Charities Act (see below for examples). The following table summarises our research income
          over the last three years:

           Research income (£’000)              8,839     8,412    8,287          
           Income as a percentage of total income 8.4%    7.7%      7.0%          
          Table 8: Research income trends                                         
          Research income is released in line with progress on the projects. Unfortunately, the pandemic
          has affected the amount of research activity that could be undertaken leading to a fall in income
          recognised over the last two years. The College currently has a portfolio of live research projects
          linked to £56 million in external grant funding.                        
                                                                                  
          The pandemic also had an impact on our research students with a number having to extend their
          research phase prior to writing up. The College has agreed to provide financial support to self-
          funding research students in the same way that research councils are.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The prevention or relief of poverty                                     
                                                                                  
          The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
          disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
          resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
          health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
          It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
          concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
          (prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
          contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.
          Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to
          educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who
          may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for
          mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through
          our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution
          and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented
          groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without
          strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily
          increasing to 815 FTE in 2020/21 (see Chart 5). 58% of the students are from ethnic minority
          backgrounds (47% on our standard undergraduate programmes), 53% male (compared with
          44%) and 35% under the age of 21 (compared with 22%). We are proud to offer an opportunity to
          this group of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and remain committed to driving
          this agenda in the higher education sector.                             
                                                                                  
          We are concerned that an outcome of the government’s review of post-18 education may
          introduce minimum A-level standards for students under 21 whereby student loan funding is not
          available to them if they need to undertake foundation years. Such a strategy will adversely affect
          a large group of students who are otherwise capable of completing a university degree (albeit
          with additional support at the outset) thereby providing themselves with an opportunity to
          enhance their economic position. We continue to lobby strongly on this point.
          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from
          ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 93%
          of our part-time students and 67% of full-time students are over 21. We provide an opportunity
          for students who wish to combine evening university teaching with daytime work and, therefore,
          offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be able to study.
                                                                                  
          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that
          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes
          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time
          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and
          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to
          continue with our current approach on access.                           
                                                                                  
          Detailed information on the ways that we provide support to our students can be found in the
          College Access and Participation Plan 2020/21 to 2024/25. Further details and a link to the
          document on the Office for Students’ web site are provided in Note 9 to the Financial
          Statements.

          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The following externally funded research projects indicate the breadth of contribution to public
          benefit objectives:                                                     
                                                                                  
          The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science               
          Dr Hubie Chen from the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems received a
          grant of £594,000 from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to
          conduct a research project in query evaluation, the process of identifying solutions to complex
          computational problems. The project aims to address the fact that many problems of interest in
          computer science are unlikely to be tractable, that is, easy to solve, using computational
          methods. The research team will study query evaluation by seeking examples of computationally
          tractable problems in the hope of better understanding the factors that determine whether a
          problem can be solved using computational methods. The study will aim to develop complexity
          measures for formulas that will allow for the identification of tractability results for query
          evaluation. Findings from the research will support a much deeper and richer understanding of
          database query evaluation and will crucially focus on efficiency, reducing costs and allowing for
          higher capabilities in the industry. The outcomes will strengthen knowledge and understanding in
          this area for the benefit of industry and future research.              
                                                                                  
          The prevention or relief of poverty                                     
                                                                                  
          The Department of Management’s Dr Fred A. Yamoah has received a grant from the Science and
          Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Food Network+ to work on a project developing more
          resilient food supply chains in Ghana. The project, Using STFC Technology to Create a Novel
          Digital Platform to Integrate Fish Farmers and Customers in Ghana, aims to address problems in
          the fish supply chain caused by the Covid pandemic and to improve the resilience of the supply
          chain for the future.                                                   
                                                                                  
          In Ghana, fish farming is a major source of nutrition and livelihood for small-scale farmers.
          However, lockdowns prompted by the Covid pandemic have caused huge disruption to the
          aquaculture sector, resulting in a loss of income and limited consumer access to this nutritious
          food supply. Dr Yamoah’s project aims to address this problem by creating a digital platform that
          will connect fish farmers with customers, addressing supply, market and transparency challenges
          that face the aquaculture food system in Ghana. Building on contemporary food delivery systems
          such as Uber Eats, the platform will link fish farmers with customers directly, ensuring that
          farmers are able to access the wider market and to sell in a safe environment. Ultimately, the
          project aims to create, harness and sustain fish supply chains in Africa for improved livelihoods,
          nutritional outcomes and social and environmental impacts.              
          The STFC Food Network+ brings together STFC researchers and facilities with research and
          industry in the agri-food sector. Their aim is to provide a sustainable supply of nutritious and
          affordable food using less land in the context of global climate change 
                                                                                  
          The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of
          religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity                   
                                                                                  
          The Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research (ICPR) at Birkbeck has published a report
          revealing vast disparities between countries in their approaches to criminal sentencing, with
          important implications for justice reform. Through legal analysis and interviews with criminal
          lawyers across a diverse group of ten countries spanning all five continents, the research focused
          on three hypothetical offence scenarios: a domestic burglary by a man with previous convictions
          for similar offences; drug importation (400 grams of heroin) by a woman from a less developed
          country; and the intentional homicide of one young man by another. Each scenario presents

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          entrenched policy challenges for sentencing law and practice. The report engages with these
          challenges, offering lessons for reform to tackle the relentless rise in prisoner numbers seen
          throughout the world in recent decades.                                 
                                                                                  
          Lead author Catherine Heard, Senior Research Fellow at the ICPR and Director of the World
          Prison Research Programme, commented: “All countries face similar dilemmas in devising
          sentencing policy, but there is huge variation in how countries respond to those dilemmas. The
          tougher, more arbitrary sentencing many countries have introduced have caused prison
          populations to surge, while leaving untouched the underlying and complex drivers of much
          offending.”.                                                            
          The ten jurisdictions examined were Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, the USA (focusing on New York
          State), India, Thailand, England and Wales, Hungary, the Netherlands and Australia (focusing on
          New South Wales).                                                       
                                                                                  
          In a second report, the prisons research team at ICPR published research on measures taken to
          control the risk of Covid in prisons and their impact on prisoners’ health and wellbeing. The
          research covers a diverse group of countries across five continents and includes first-hand
          accounts of how life in custody changed from March 2020. When the pandemic emerged, most
          countries’ prison systems were running above their official capacity, after decades of rising
          prisoner numbers. From early March 2020, prisons across the world quickly locked down. With
          visits from the outside world largely suspended, prisoners were deprived of family contact, legal
          advice, visits from voluntary agencies and monitoring bodies. Rehabilitation, work, education and
          other activities largely ceased. Prisoners spent long periods locked up with little or no contact
          with others.                                                            
                                                                                  
          Initially, the restrictions were met with protest, disorder and serious violence. Since then, with no
          end to the pandemic in sight, this protracted ‘double lockdown’ has continued to take a heavy toll
          on prisoners’ mental and physical health. The research shows that the health and social impacts
          of the pandemic and the measures taken to contain it are more severe in countries with
          overcrowded, under-resourced prisons. The risks of spread of infection are much greater in
          prisons with limited physical space and inadequate staffing levels – conditions that also make it
          even more difficult to maintain provision for education, work, rehabilitation, and social interaction
          at this time of public health emergency.                                
          Early signs are that global prisoner numbers have declined since early 2020, for several reasons
          connected to the pandemic. Sustaining and building on these reductions is the single most
          effective strategy to contain the public health risks presented by contagious diseases without
          causing collateral damage to the mental and physical health of prisoners, prison staff and their
          families.

          A study from The Centre for Building Resilience in Breast Cancer (BRiC) at Birkbeck has
          demonstrated that social support and good cognitive health can protect against depression in
          metastatic breast cancer. The research also finds that being of younger age (34-50 years) and
          having poorer cognitive function is met with increased levels of post-traumatic stress in this
          population. The study, using a sample of 59 women over the past year, is the first to examine the
          link between cognitive function and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress
          in metastatic breast cancer patients.                                   
                                                                                  
          It is believed that around 30% of women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer go on to
          develop metastatic breast cancer, also known as secondary breast cancer or stage IV breast

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          cancer, which refers to the spread of breast cancer to other organs such as liver, bone, brain, or
          lungs, rendering the cancer incurable. Recent research shows that depression can escalate
          cancer progression and increase the risk of cancer specific mortality by 30% in breast cancer
          (Wang et al., 2020). Despite this evidence, there is little to hardly any research that addresses
          the emotional and cognitive needs of women with metastatic breast cancer leaving them highly
          under-represented in research.                                          
          In the current study, women with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer completed a series of
          online questionnaires and cognitive tests to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and
          cognitive function. The results, published in the journal Psycho-Oncology, demonstrated that
          younger women who reported poorer levels of cognitive functioning were at greatest risk of
          increased post-traumatic stress symptoms. When looking at the role of social support, the
          authors found that the combined effect of social support and good cognitive function could
          protect against depression symptoms in metastatic breast cancer patients.
                                                                                  
          A second BRiC study also found evidence that job insecurity created by Covid can lead to greater
          depression levels in women living with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Figures showed that job
          security was 40% lower in women who were furloughed or unable to work as a result of the
          outbreak compared to women who had continued working. Those with low job security scored
          approximately 26% higher on depression than those with high job security.
                                                                                  
          Workability in women after breast cancer diagnosis has proven to improve cognitive and
          emotional health as well as protect against anxiety and depression leading to a better quality of
          life in survivorship. Work plays a central role in their recovery and provides them with a sense of
          normality, purpose and stability after what has otherwise been a highly distressing and uncertain
          period in their lives. Threats from Covid on job security show the psychological harm that such
          women are exposed to, which can lead to exaggerated levels of clinical depression.
                                                                                  
          The study, which was based on a series of online questionnaires completed by 234 women with
          primary breast cancer in the UK, measured the impact of Covid on perceptions of work during the
          peak of the pandemic. The results further revealed that women who had been furloughed by an
          employer or left unable to work as a consequence of the outbreak had significantly greater job
          insecurity.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)      
                                                                                  
          Strategic Planning Committee                                            
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor and consists of College
          officers with strategic management responsibility. Its remit is to act as the College’s Executive
          Committee responsible for its effective and successful operation. SPC considers College-wide
          strategic issues and priorities and advises Governors accordingly. It is responsible for internal
          planning and resource allocation, policy and procedures. It oversees the annual planning and
          budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and Professional Services on developing plans
          and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for presentation to Finance and General Purposes
          Committee.                                                              
          Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee                   
                                                                                  
          Under the College Statutes Governors have oversight and responsibility for all the College’s
          activities, but must consider the advice of the Academic Board on all academic matters.
          Academic Board is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the College and
          reports termly on the business it has considered. The Academic Board is chaired by the Vice-
          Chancellor and has a membership of more than 150 drawn from academic and Library staff and
          the students of the College. To increase the effectiveness of its decision making, it has
          established the Academic Board Executive Committee (ABExCo) as its steering committee.
          ABExCo is also chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, whose members include the Deputy and Pro Vice-
          Chancellors, the Executive Deans of the academic Schools and the academic staff and student
          Governors, all of whom are also members of the full Academic Board.     
                                                                                  
          The membership of all of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-7.
                                                                                  
          Statement of internal control                                           
                                                                                  
          The Governing Body is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control that
          supports the achievement of Birkbeck’s strategies, policies, aims and objectives whilst
          safeguarding the public and external funds for which we are responsible, in accordance with the
          responsibilities assigned to the Governing Body in the College Charter and Statutes and the
          public interest governance principles set out in the regulatory framework for Higher Education in
          England.                                                                
          The system of internal control includes arrangements for the prevention and detection of
          corruption, fraud, bribery and other irregularities. It is designed to manage rather than eliminate
          the risk of failure to fulfil strategies, policies, aims and objectives and safeguard public funds,
          and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness.
                                                                                  
          The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify the principal
          risks, evaluate the nature and extent of those risks and manage them efficiently, effectively and
          economically. The process is regularly reviewed by Governors and accords with the principles in
          the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.              
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck manages risks through a Risk Register, which is reviewed each term by the College Risk
          Management Group reporting to Strategic Planning Committee, and the Audit Committee
          reporting to Governors. The College’s Risk Management Policy is reviewed annually by the Risk
          Management Group and Audit Committee reporting to Governors.

               Code of Governance and concluded that the College is compliant with the principles of
               the Code. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review
               Birkbeck's processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code;
                                                                                  
            •  the Governing Body agreed to review its effectiveness in 2021 and will consider the
               review report in November 2021. It will follow up in terms of response and confirmed
               actions in March 2022. The previous effectiveness review was in 2013/14 and
               concluded that the Governing Body, individually and collectively, is effective. The previous
               review put in place measures to improve new Governor selection and induction and to
               give Governors more opportunities for engagement with the College outside formal
               Governors’ meetings;                                               
                                                                                  
            •  the current review, originally due in 2018, has been postponed by several factors. A new
               Chair of Governors as well as several new independent Governors started their terms of
               office in 2019 and 2020 and the decision was taken to start the review after they had
               completed induction and started their terms of office. The global pandemic and the
               impact of the national lockdown in March 2020 led to a further delay and the review
               commenced in summer 2021.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)      
                                                                                  
            •  the diversity of the Governing Body has increased following the appointment of new
               independent governors through an open call for expressions of interest;
                                                                                  
            •  institution level collaborations are overseen by the College Collaborations Approval Panel
               which reports to Strategic Planning Committee; and                 
                                                                                  
            •  Governors review annually their Statement of Primary Responsibility which covers
               responsibilities reserved to Governors and responsibilities delegated to committees or to
               the Vice-Chancellor.                                               
                                                                                  
          There have been no significant internal control weaknesses or failures during this reporting
          period. This statement is based on the information provided to Governors in the regular reports
          on internal audit and risk management.                                  
          Governors have appointed a professional independent Internal Audit Service whose annual
          programme is approved by the Audit Committee. The internal audit function provides, by
          undertaking review, independent objective assurance to the Governing Body, through the Audit
          Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the design and
          effectiveness of the operation of internal controls that are intended to control critical business
          application risks. Internal audit also helps the College accomplish its objectives by bringing a
          systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk
          management, control and governance processes and, by working with management, adding
          value through advice and guidance.                                      
                                                                                  
          The internal audit work programme is drawn down from a risk-focused audit plan, which remains
          dynamic and is updated regularly to reflect changes in the College’s risk profile. Internal audit
          monitors the progress made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure
          that they are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the
          Audit Committee.                                                        
                                                                                  
          Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:

               affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cashflow for the financial
               year;

            •  external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those
               purposes and managed appropriately; and                            
            •  income has been applied in accordance with the Office for Students’ Terms and

          In our opinion, the financial statements:                               
                                                                                  
            •  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the College’s affairs as at 31

               losses, changes in reserves and of the Group’s cash flows for the year then ended; and
            •  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
               Accounting Practice.                                               
          We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the College”) and
          its subsidiary (“the Group”) for the year ended 31 July 2021 which comprise the Consolidated
          and College Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and College Statement of
          Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated and College
          Statement of Changes in Reserves and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of
          significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
          preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial
          Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
          Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).        
                                                                                  
          Basis for opinion                                                       
                                                                                  
          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
          (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We
          believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
          for our opinion.                                                        
                                                                                  
          Independence                                                            
                                                                                  
          We are independent of the Group and College in accordance with the ethical requirements that
          are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
          Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
          requirements.                                                           
          Conclusions relating to going concern                                   
                                                                                  
          In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Board of Governors’ use of the
          going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
          Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating
          to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group
          and College’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from
          when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the
          responsibilities of the Board of Governors’ members with respect to going concern are described
          in the relevant sections of this report.                                
                                                                                  
          Other information                                                       
                                                                                  
          The Board of Governors is responsible for the other information. Other information comprises the
          information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s
          report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and
          we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

          In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
          information including the Strategic Review, Statement of Corporate Governance and Internal
          Controls, and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
          the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
          materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
          misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the
          financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work

          In our opinion, in all material respects:                               
                                                                                  
            •  funds from whatever source administered by the College for specific purposes have been
               properly applied to those purposes and managed in accordance with relevant legislation;
            •  funds provided by the OfS, UK Research and Innovation (including Research England),
               the Education and Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Education have been
               applied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions; and  
            •  the requirements of the OfS’s Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) have been met.
                                                                                  
          We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the OfS requires
          us to report to you if, in our opinion:                                 
                                                                                  
            •  the College’s grant and fee income, as disclosed in the note to the accounts, has been
               materially misstated; and                                          
            •  the College’s expenditure on access and participation activities for the financial year has
               been materially misstated.                                         
                                                                                  
          Responsibilities of Governors                                           
                                                                                  
          As explained more fully in the Governors’ Statement of Primary Responsibilities set out on page
          42, the Board of Governors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for
          being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Board of
          Governors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
          from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements,
          The Board of Governors is responsible for assessing the Group and the College’s ability to
          continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
          using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Governors either intends to
          liquidate the Group or the College or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
          do so.                                                                  
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements    
                                                                                  
          Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
          whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
          auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
          is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
          material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
          considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
          influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                    
                                                                                  
          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF BIRKBECK,         
          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)                                        
                                                                                  
          Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
                                                                                  
          Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
          design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
          misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures
          are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
          Based on our understanding of the Group and the sector in which it operates, we identified that
          the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations are related to their registration
          with the Office for Students ("OfS”) and their ongoing conditions of registration, and we
          considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the Group
          Financial Statements or their continued operation. We also considered those laws and
          regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as compliance with the
          OfS Accounts Direction and tax legislation. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures
          to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Board and other
          management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence if any.
                                                                                  
          We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the
          financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal
          risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results and
          management bias in accounting estimates.                                
                                                                                  
          The audit procedures to address the risks identified included:          
                                                                                  
            •  performing analytical procedures to identify unusual or unexpected relationships that
               may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud. Areas of identified risk are then
               tested substantively;                                              
                                                                                  
            •  challenging assumptions made by management in their significant accounting estimates
               in particular in relation to impairment, depreciation, defined benefit pension scheme
               obligations and recoverability of trade receivables;               
                                                                                  
            •  discussions with management, including consideration of known or suspected instances
               of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud, including direct representation
               from the Accountable Officer;                                      
                                                                                  
            •  identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted from staff
               members with privilege access rights, journals posted by key management and journals
               posted after the year end;                                         
                                                                                  
            •  reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit
               reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC, OfS and relevant regulators to identify
               any actual or potential frauds or any potential weaknesses in internal control which could
               result in fraud susceptibility; and                                
            •  reviewing items included in the fraud register as well as the results of internal audit’s
               investigation into these matters.                                  
                                                                                  
          Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial
          statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is
          higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate
          concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are

          inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance
          with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
          statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.               
                                                                                  
          A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on
          the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
          description forms part of our auditor’s report.                         
          In addition, we also report to you whether income from funding bodies, grants and income for
          specific purposes and from other restricted funds administered by the College have been
          properly applied only for the purposes for which they were received and whether income has
          been applied in accordance with the Statutes and, where appropriate, with the Terms and
          Conditions of Funding with the OfS and Research England.

          This report is made solely to the Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Section 75 of
          the Higher Education Research Act 2017. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
          state to the College’s Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an
          auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
          or assume responsibility to anyone other than the College and the members as a body, for our
          audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

       1.   Basis of preparation                                                  
                                                                                  
            These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
            Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial
            Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
            Ireland. The College is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
            requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
            convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
            The College's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and
            position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.
                                                                                  
            Going Concern                                                         
            The impact of lower student income following Brexit and increased competition across London, together
            with higher staff costs, have significantly impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs
            (due to promotions, inflationary increases, increment advancement and pension costs) exceed the
            inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on
            undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of 5% of income eroded post-Brexit but
            without significant remedial action these deficits will grow as the gap between staff costs and tuition
            income widens.                                                        
                                                                                  
            With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22, Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges which
            make the route to financial sustainability narrower and steeper. We are identifying the immediate actions
            whose delivery can be geared in such a way as to deliver significant short-term gains in terms of efficiency
            and income generation. These actions are being drawn together in a short-term recovery plan nested
            within the overall 2021-26 strategy and constituting the first stages of strategy implementation.
                                                                                  
            Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income recovery and
            efficiency savings, including stress testing. Although deficits are forecast for the next two years under the
            mid-case scenario the forecasts indicate that cash reserves will be maintained above £20 million. The
            forecasts assume that we will redevelop Birkbeck Central as planned but we will need to carefully consider
            affordability. To help manage risk the decision to tender for a construction company to undertake the
            works will be taken in November 2022 once we know the outcome of student recruitment for 2022/23
            and progress towards cost savings targets.                            
            Governors have reviewed the financial forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and
            medium term recovery strategy and the risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges
            resulting from the pandemic drop in student numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the College
            has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, we
            continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.
                                                                                  
       2.   Basis of consolidation                                                
            The consolidated financial statements include the College and its subsidiary for the financial year to 31
            July 2021. Intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.  
                                                                                  
            The financial year-end of the College's subsidiary, Cambridge House Limited, is 31 October. Transactions
            to 31 July 2021 are included in the consolidation.                    
            The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union
            as the College does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
       3.   Income recognition                                                    
            Tuition fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the
            Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students
            are studying. Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment
            income receivable is shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as
            expenditure and not deducted from income.                             
                                                                                  
            Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Consolidated Statement of
            Comprehensive Income and Expenditure when the goods or services are supplied to the external
            customers or the terms of the contract have been satisfied.           
                                                                                  
            Investment income is credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and
            Expenditure on a receivable basis.                                    
                                                                                  
            Grant funding                                                         
            Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and RE research and research grants, are
            recognised as income over the periods in which the College recognises the related costs for which the
            grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as
            deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after
            more than one year as appropriate.                                    
                                                                                  
            Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
            College is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received
            in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within
            creditors and released to income as the conditions are met.           
                                                                                  
            Donations and endowments                                              
            Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
            endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
            when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is
            utilised in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.
            Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the College is entitled to the funds.
                                                                                  
            Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
            during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to
            the terms applied to the individual endowment fund.                   
            There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
          a) Restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular
            objective;                                                            
          b) Unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
            invested to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the College; and
          c) Restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently
            invested to generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       3.   Income recognition (continued)                                        
            Capital grants                                                        
            Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
            were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the College has
            satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
                                                                                  
       4.   Accounting for retirement benefits                                    
            College staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
            (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
            primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
            professionally qualified independent actuaries.                       
            Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
            of the College due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
            contribution retirement benefit schemes.                              
            A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
            schemes.                                                              
            Defined contribution plan                                             
            A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the College pays fixed
            contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
            amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense
            in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
                                                                                  
            Defined benefit plan                                                  
            Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
            defined benefit plans, the College’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
            employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
            returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
            the College. The College should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of
            plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
            employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine
            its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed by a
            qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
            recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the College is able to recover the surplus either
            through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
                                                                                  
       5.   Employment benefits                                                   
            Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
            expense in the year in which the employees render service to the College. Any unused benefits are accrued
            and measured as the additional amount the College expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.
                                                                                  
       6.   Finance leases                                                        
            Leases in which the College assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
            asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
            corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
            and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
            Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
            outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
            a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
       7.   Service concession arrangements                                       
            Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
            present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
            financial liability.                                                  
                                                                                  
            Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance charges
            and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the arrangement.
                                                                                  
       8.   Operating leases                                                      
            Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
            premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.        
                                                                                  
       9.   Foreign currency                                                      
            Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
            transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
            are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
            differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income and
            Expenditure for the year.                                             
                                                                                  
       10.  Fixed assets                                                          
            Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
            losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
            transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at
            the date of that revaluation.                                         
            Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
            assets.                                                               
                                                                                  
            Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a building are
            capitalised.                                                          
                                                                                  
            Land and buildings                                                    
            Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
            initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
            benefits to the College. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
            life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.          
            The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
            depreciated as follows:                                               
            Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                            
            Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                         
            Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years                                   
                                                                                  
            Leasehold land: the life of the lease                                 
            Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation is charged until the asset is brought into use

Birkbeck, University of London                                             
       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
       10.  Fixed assets (continued)                                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Equipment                                                             
            Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
            equipment is capitalised.                                             
                                                                                  
            Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful lives
            are as follows:                                                       
            - Computer hardware: 3 years                                          
            - Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
            - Other equipment: 3 to 5 years                                       
                                                                                  
            Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
            Balance Sheet.                                                        
                                                                                  
       11.  Heritage assets                                                       
            Works of art and other valuable artefacts have been capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
            acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. Heritage assets are not depreciated
            as their long economic life means that any depreciation would not be material.
                                                                                  
       12.  Intangible assets                                                     
            Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
            software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial
            phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8
            years.                                                                
            Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the
            Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for
            capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then
            such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes
            available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the
            useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.
                                                                                  
       13.  Investments                                                           
            Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
            Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the College's accounts. Current asset
            investments are held at fair value with movements recognised in the Total Comprehensive Income for the
            year.                                                                 
                                                                                  
       14.  Cash and cash equivalents                                             
            Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months and
            overdrafts.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                       
                                                                                  
       Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                               
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
       15.   Provisions                                                           
                                                                                  
             Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:          
          a) the College has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
          b) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
          c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     
                                                                                  
             The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
             pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.          
                                                                                  
       16.   Taxation                                                             
             The College is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore, a
             charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the College is
             potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered
             by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the Taxation of
             Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively charitable
             purposes.                                                            
             The College receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
             included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
             cost.                                                                
                                                                                  
             The College’s subsidiary is liable to Corporation Tax in the same way as any other commercial organisation.
                                                                                  
       17.   Reserves                                                             
             Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
             which, through endowment to the College, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the College
             must hold in perpetuity.                                             
                                                                                  
             Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
             therefore, the College is restricted in the use of these funds.      
                                                                                  
       18.   Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
             In preparing these financial statements the College has made the following judgements:
                                                                                  
          a) As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is recognised as a
             liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan agreed in the 2018
             actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of future salaries between
             1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each triennial valuation of the
             scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future salary inflations, changes in
             staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out in note 28.

           Remuneration of the Vice Chancellor                                    
           The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been determined and reviewed through appropriate and robust
           processes in terms of independence, objectivity, and assessment of individual and overall institutional
           performance.                                                           
                                                                                  
           Remuneration Committee                                                 
                                                                                  
           The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been set and reviewed by a remuneration panel comprised of
           independent Governors. The panel includes the Chair of Governors, but in accordance with good practice, is
           chaired by another independent Governor. The Vice Chancellor is not a member of this panel and does not
           attend or participate in its meetings or business. The panel is supported by the College Secretary & Clerk to
           the Governors and, additionally, advice is provided, or commissioned, by the Director of Human Resources.
                                                                                  
           Process                                                                
                                                                                  
           The panel reviews the remuneration of the Vice Chancellor annually in the light of the following
           information:                                                           
           • Sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other sources for a range of
             relevant comparator institutions.                                    
                                                                                  
           • Retention and continuity of senior leadership through a period of profound challenge and
             transformation for the College has been a priority, thus additional institutions have been added to the
             benchmarking profile to support objective consideration of retention issues.
           • The outcome of the Vice Chancellor’s annual appraisal conducted by the Chair of Governors. This is a
             formal documented process in which annual objectives are set and performance against those
             objectives are reviewed.                                             
                                                                                  
           • The broader context provided by institutional performance information and institutional KPIs agreed by
             Governors.                                                           
                                                                                  
           Outcomes                                                               
                                                                                  
           The Vice Chancellor last received an increase in base salary, over and above the level of the national pay
           award, in 2012. He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. It was noted that the Vice-Chancellor had
           not made an application for any increase in remuneration in respect of the academic year 2020/21 and his
           salary will not be subject to increase in relation to the national pay award. The Vice Chancellor’s current
           salary reflects sustained quality and continuity of leadership over an 18 year period which has had
           transformational impact. The College has met, managed and overcome major strategic threats - the loss of
           40% of core teaching funding due to government policy change in 2007 and the fundamental 60% decline
           in traditional part-time study post 2012. The College’s distinct mission stands out in the sector: widening
           access, opportunity and flexibility for students in an environment informed by the best research. Birkbeck is
           one of only twenty UK institutions that rate highly in both REF and TEF. Delivering successfully on its mission
           in this environment has required the College to restructure, reposition, re-invent and innovate. The Vice
           Chancellor’s role in delivering this change, operating in a long-standing, collegial environment and building
           the widest base of support amongst students, staff, stakeholders and funders, has been vital to the viability
           and success of the College.

           The Remuneration Committee took the decision that the 2020/21 pay review processes for senior College
           post holders (the Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Pro Vice-Chancellors, College Secretary,
           Executive Deans, and Professorial and Director level staff) should operate with a rigorous and limited focus
           on exceptional performance and contribution, particularly in relation to maintaining successful operations
           during the Coronavirus pandemic. In reaching this decision to Committee was mindful of the position of the
           College, the need to promote pay equality, and the broader guidance from the Office for Students on pay
           restraint for senior staff.

           The Governors are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the College's operations
           and the composition of the Board, being drawn from local public and private sector organisations,
           transactions may take place with organisations in which a governor may have an interest. Such transactions
           have been declared under note 26 Related Parties.                      
           No governors received any remuneration or waived payments from the group during the year (2019/20: Nil).
           Governors who are employees of the College receive no additional remuneration for their services as
           governors.                                                             
           No governors received reimbursement of travel expenses incurred in attending meetings and events in their
           official capacity during the year (2019/20: Nil).

           A programme of projects from the Student Experience Review (SER) underpins our Access and Participation Plan
           (APP). This is a multi-year enhancement programme, accelerated in 2020/21, with a strategic focus on enhancing
           and expanding the digital capability and resilience of our taught portfolio. This is designed to improve student
           retention and student success amongst a mature, part-time and commuter-based student community. Despite the
           pandemic creating new uncertainties around student numbers plus additional pressures on the College to deliver
           operationally during this chapter of the APP, the commitments made were achieved under the following categories.
                                                                                  
           Access                                                                 
           The actual spend on Access (adults in the community) during the year was £500,000 compared with a forecast
           investment of £381,000. We do not consider this to be a reportable variance to the Office for Student (OfS), as the
           increase is against one line in the APP and has not reduced the commitments or support in other APP areas, as
           there are no access deficits in our benchmark metrics. This was a proportional management response to
           supporting some of the most vulnerable groups seeking entry into Higher Education during the pandemic.
                                                                                  
           The expansion of our portfolio of undergraduate Degrees with a Foundation Year contributed to the increased
           spend and has provided supported entry opportunities in line with our widening participation mission.

       Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2021                       
                                                                                  
       Notes to the Accounts (continued)                                          
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        9a Access and Particpation (continued)                                    
           Financial Support                                                      
           In 2020/21 the financial support spend was increased and targeted to support students during the pandemic.
           £400,000 of additional financial support (which is not APP countable) was provided by the OfS and this was
           disbursed to home and international students across all modes and levels of study. It also supported an Access to
           Digital Learning Fund to provide computers and equipment to students who were learning remotely for the whole
           of the academic year.                                                  
                                                                                  
           The introduction of the part time maintenance loan by the Government for 2018/19 has now become embedded
           in the financial support infrastructure of the College and there is strong awareness of its availability in the
           applicant and student body. Our spend in 2020/21 was £701,000 against a commitment of £699,000 for the
           year. We will continue to monitor the financial support commitments in the context of the ongoing pandemic and
           the outcomes we deliver.                                               
           Disability                                                             
                                                                                  
           We were not required to set a target for investment in disability. Across the 2020-2025 APP the College committed
           to ensuring everyone who could participate was able to. This investment supported individual Study Support Plans,
           mental health and student counsellors, as well as disability advisors. The recommendation of the SER to offer
           more online study opportunities has resulted in a more inclusive learning environment and one that better
           supports dyslexia and other neurodiverse conditions. The move to online and remote assessments has also
           significantly reduced ‘exam hall anxiety’ whilst supporting attainment.
           Research and Evaluation                                                
           The actual spend of £121,000 in this category compares favourably with the commitment of £100,000. A key
           deliverable in this sub-section was qualitative and quantitative research on the awarding/attainment gap between
           student cohorts identified in the APP. A report has been produced and an implementation plan drawn up against
           the findings. The report has been considered by Education Committee and SPC and will be presented to Academic
           Board in academic year 2021/22. This will be used to inform further interventions in the coming period of the
           plan.

           Following a tender exercise in 2019 new investment managers were appointed. Transfer of the College's fixed
           asset investments from the Newton Fund to the Mercer Sustainable Global Equity Fund and the Ruffer Charity
           Assets Trusts Fund was completed during 2020/21.                       
           The College receives detailed semi-annual sustainability reporting from Mercer on the global equity fund, which
           includes details of carbon intensity, sustainable thematic allocations, engagement activity and case studies. This
           reporting allows the Investment Committee to understand in more detail how the College’s equity investments
           are performing from a responsible investment perspective. A similar performance report is provided regularly by
           Ruffer.

           The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the
           contractual obligation with the USS to make deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. In
           calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the
           duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation. Key assumptions are set out in note 28.
           The USS 2020 valuation was signed with an effective date of 1 October 2021. As the valuation was signed after
           the year-end it constitutes a non-adjusting event. Had the valuation been completed prior to the year-end this
           would have resulted in a provision of £49.5 million, an increase of £32.7 million from the current year-end
           provision. This increase in provision would have resulted in a higher charge to the Statement of Comprehensive
           Income of £32.7 million giving a revised total deficit for the year of £14.7 million.
                                                                                  
           The 2020 valuation requires a recommended deed on benefit changes be executed by 28 February 2022.
           Should the benefit changes not be executed by this date the liability will increase to £77.9 million for the year-
           ended 31 July 2022.                                                    
           See also note 7 in respect of significant one-off pension costs. More details on the 2020 actuarial valuation are
           set out in note 27.

           During the year the College undertook further restructuring. A provision has been recognised for amounts
           agreed due to be paid after the year-end.

           The USS pension liability included in these accounts for the year-ended 31 July 2021 is based on the 2018
           valuation which includes a deficit recovery rate of 6.3% from 1 October 2021. Since the year-end the 2020
           valuation has been signed, this valuation agrees that no deficit recovery contributions are payable
           until 1 April 2022. Deficit recovery contributions of 6.3% are payable from this date until March 2038.

           The College owns 100% of the shares of its subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Ltd. The principal
           activity of the company is to own and develop a building on the Euston Road. The company is registered in
           England.                                                               
           During the year it was agreed that the property held within the subsidiary would be transferred to the College
           now that the property development is complete. The transfer was completed on 20 October 2021. It was also
           agreed that the subsidiary company would be wound up following the transfer.

          All Governors and senior staff of the College are required to complete an annual statement detailing any significant personal links
          they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn
          from a range of private and public sector organisations) it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a
          Governor or senior member of staff may have an interest. All transactions involving related parties are conducted in accordance with
          the College's financial regulations and procurement policies/procedures.
          The College has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 102 and has not disclosed transactions with its wholly owned
          subsidiary, Birkbeck College (Cambridge House) Limited.                 
          During the year the Group entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related parties. Transactions
          entered into, and balances outstanding at 31 July 2021 are as follows:

          The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students' Union as the College does not
          exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of £340,000 (2019/20: £340,000) was provided to the Union.
          In 2018/19 a loan of £175,000 was issued to the Birkbeck Students' Union. The loan was issued to support their return to a position
          of financial sustainability. The loan is repayable over seven years and no interest is charged. The loan outstanding as at 31 July 2021
          was £115,000.                                                           
          At the year-end there was a balance due to the Students' Union of £74,000 (2019/20: Nil). As at 31 July 2021 there was no balance
          due from the Students' Union (2019/20: £53,000).

           (i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)                      
           The College participates in Universities Superannuation Scheme. The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,
           providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme
           are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are
           not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore
           exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the
           underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As required by Section 28
           of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a wholly defined
           contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the
           contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan)
           that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a
           liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit)
           with the related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.
                                                                                  
           FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a
           collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a
           scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as
           Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer has
           entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the
           recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they
           relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.
           College Governors are satisfied that Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-
           employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under
           the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.

       Notes to the Accounts (continued)                                          
                                                                                  
       for the year ended 31 July 2021                                            
                                                                                  
       27  Pension schemes (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
           The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2018 (the
           valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method. A valuation as at 31 March 2020 is
           underway but not yet complete.                                         
                                                                                  
           Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the
           following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.
                                                                                  
           The 2018 valuation was the fifth valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime
           introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to
           have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of
           the assets of the scheme was £63.7 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £67.3
           billion indicating a shortfall of £3.6 billion and a funding ratio of 95%.
                                                                                  
           In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the College currently recognises a provision for its
           obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).
                                                                                  
           The key financial assumptions used in the 2018 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the
           Statement of Funding Principles: https://www.uss.co.uk/about-us/valuation-and-funding/statement-of-

           The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based
           on analysis of the scheme's experience carried out as part of the 2018 actuarial valuation. The mortality
           assumptions used in these figures are as follows:

           contractual commitment to fund the past deficit.                       
                                                                                  
           A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2018 valuation. The plan required payment of 2% of
           salaries over the period 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2021 at which point the rate would increase to 6%.
           Since the year-end, the 2020 valuation has signed with an effective date of 1 October 2021. The 2020 valuation
           came into effect with a dual rate schedule of contributions:           
           - Leg 1 - includes an increase in contribution rates from the 2018 valuation and a longer deficit recovery
             period. Deficit recovery contributions (DRC) under the 2018 valuation cease from 1 October 2021 and DRCs
             under the 2020 valuation commence from 1 April 2022. From 1 April 2022, when the proposed benefit
             changes are assumed to have been implemented, the DRCs are equal to 6.3% salaries and are payable for
             the length of the recovery plan until 31 March 2038.                 
                                                                                  
           - Leg 2 - includes a more significant increase in contribution rates from the 2018 valuation and a shorter
             deficit recovery period. From 1 October 2022 DRCs commence at 3% then increase every 6 months (the
             difference between 37% required to fund future service cost and the total contributions being collected) until
             they reach 20% at 1 October 2025. They remain at this level until 31 July 2032. This leg becomes applicable
             if the Joint Negotiating Committee recommended deed on benefit changes has not been executed by 28
             February 2022.                                                       
           Employer and employee contribution rates for the scheme during the last three years were:

           (ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL)
                                                                                  
           General description of the Pension Scheme                              
                                                                                  
           Birkbeck College participates in the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London ("SAUL"),
           which is a centralised defined benefit scheme within the United Kingdon and was contracted out of the
           Second State Pension (prior to April 2016).                            
                                                                                  
           SAUL is an independently-managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
           institutions with links to higher education.                           
                                                                                  
           Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings ("CARE")
           basis.                                                                 
           Birkbeck College is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current or participating employer's
           obligations under the Rules of SAUL, but in the event of an insolvency of any participating employer within
           SAUL, an amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that
           employer, may be spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the next actuarial
           valuation.                                                             
                                                                                  
           Funding Policy                                                         
           SAUL's statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
           the Trustee in payring SAUL's benefits as they fall due (the "Technical Provisions"). The Trustee adopts
           assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefirs
           already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued
           pension rights to be met.                                              
                                                                                  
           The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events
           turning out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove
           the risk that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.
                                                                                  
           A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
           independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2020.
           Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
           accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.        
           The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2021 and will be reviewed again
           at SAUL's next formal valuation in 2023.                               
                                                                                  
           At the 31 March 2020 valuation SAUL was 94% funded on its Technical Provisions basis. However, market
           movements following the valuation date were positive and the Trustee and Employers agreed to allow for
           post-valuation experience up to 30 April 2021. As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at
           that date, no deficit contributions were required. However, the Trustee and the Employers have agreed that
           the ongoing Employers' contributions will increase from a rate of 16% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE
           salaries from 1 April 2022 and to 21% of CARE Salaries from 1 January 2023.

           Accounting Policy                                                      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
           Birkbeck College is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and
           does not identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of
           SAUL's assets at 31 March 2020 was £3,612 million representing 94% of the liabilities. The market value of
           SAUL's assets at 30 April 2021 was £4,369 million representing 109% of the estimated liabilities.
           It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.
           Birkbeck College accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and
           pension costs are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs
           28.11 of FRS 102.                                                      
                                                                                  
           Although there was a Technical Provision deficit at 31 March 2020, allowing for post valuation experience to
           30 April 2021, SAUL has a Technical Provisions surplus. Therefore no deficit contributions were required
           following the 2020 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit
           contribtutions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the College.
