A group plan consists of a collection of entities           \n     under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A                 \n     multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common              \n     control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such              \n     as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a                  \n     multi-employer scheme where the employer has entered into an                 \n     agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer                   \n     will fund a deficit results in the recognition of a liability for the        \n     contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent           \n     that they relate to the deficit) with the resulting expense charged          \n     through the profit or loss account in accordance with section 28             \n     of FRS 102. The Council Members are satisfied that Universities              \n     Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a multi-employer               \n     scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of             \n     the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in existence           \n     Financial Statements 2022/23                          Aston University   45",

Agency staff are excluded as it is not possible with the current systems and\n   processes in place to identify the equivalent annual salary at an individual level. Agency staff are used for a range of activities across the\n   University, however, they are often not full-time, are charged for via third parties often on a consolidated basis and the rate charged\n   includes a fee to the third party and VAT. Therefore, it is not possible to identify an accurate median salary for these individuals.\n                                                                                  \n   Emoluments of the Vice-Chancellor                                              \n                                  Year ended 31 July 2023  Year ended 31 July 2022\n                                Professor Professor Aleks Total Professor Alec Professor Saskia Total\n                                  Saskia Subic (from 29 Cameron (to 30 Hansen (from 1\n                              Hansen (to 28 August 2022) November 2021) December 2021)\n                              August 2022)                                        \n                                  £’000    £’000 £’000     £’000    £’000 £’000   \n   Basic Salary                     16      254   270       120      134   254    \n   Pension contributions and payments in lieu of                                  \n                                    5         -     5        -        42    42    \n   contributions                                                                  \n   Benefit Replacement Payment       -       47    47       16         -    16    \n   Relocation costs                  -        4     4        -         -    -     \n   Living accommodation              -        1     1        -         -    -     \n                                    21      306   328       136      176   312    \n   The Vice-Chancellor took up post in August 2022, replacing the Interim Vice-Chancellor who had been in post since 1st December 2021.\n   Former Vice-Chancellor                                                         \n                                                                                  \n   The Former Interim Vice-Chancellor was an internal appointment that included the adjustment of a range of Executive-level responsibilities,\n   including some Executive roles taking on interim responsibility for aspects of operational leadership that would normally be undertaken by\n   the Vice-Chancellor.                                                           \n   In determining the pay for the Interim Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Committee used benchmarking data on Vice-Chancellor\n   remuneration to determine a fair and equitable total pay position based on the nature, content and duration of the interim appointment.\n   The performance of the Interim Vice-Chancellor was monitored throughout her interim appointment including through ongoing 1:1\n   performance review with the Chair of Council.                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   52          Aston University                                 Financial Statements 2022/23",

The emoluments of the Vice-Chancellor above exclude employer’s social security.\n     The Vice Chancellor was not a member of the USS pension scheme and therefore there were no employer contributions in 2022/23. The\n     University made a benefit replacement payment in lieu of pension contributions to USS.\n     There is dedicated Executive accommodation within the Nelson building operated by Conference Aston Limited. This can be generally\n     used for ad hoc overnight accommodation. This is not a standard hotel room, and as such there is no direct loss of income from this\n     arrangement. Valuation of this benefit is complex and has been broken down into three elements: rateable value per annum of the\n     apartment (£5,685); value of any furniture provided (determined as 20% of the purchase cost of any furniture, this gives a benefit value\n     of £1,137 per annum); and value of utilities provided (an apportionment of the overall building cost results in a benefit value of £1,977 per\n     annum). This gives an overall benefit per annum of £8,799. The Vice-Chancellor had access to this accommodation during the year. The\n     figures included above within relocation costs and living accommodation represent the estimated non-business use of this facility by the\n     Vice-Chancellor during the financial year. It has been assumed that 180 days have been utilised by the Vice Chancellor for non-business\n     use. Of this amount three quarters (£3,525) has been allocated to relocation and the balance (£1,175) to living accommodation.\n     The performance of the Vice-Chancellor was monitored throughout his employment including through 1:1 performance appraisals\n     with the Chair of Council. The University does not have an Executive Bonus Scheme.\n     In setting the pay of the Vice-Chancellor the Remuneration Workforce Strategy Committee used a variety of benchmark data sets to\n     get a rounded picture of what fair and competitive total pay looks like for the role at Aston University. The primary comparison was\n     carried out using several different data points including the annual UCEA Senior Staff Remuneration Report and the CUC Survey of\n     Vice Chancellors Remuneration Report which provide a picture of where the incumbent sat relative to the wider Higher Education\n     Sector and other HEIs. The conclusion of that comparison determined that the base and total reward for the role at Aston were fairly\n     positioned against the market.                                               \n     Additionally, the Remuneration Committee commissioned an independent external review of senior remuneration against the wider\n     private and public sectors to provide a benchmark of levels of pay for senior roles found in these markets. This analysis similarly\n     concluded that the remuneration of the Vice-Chancellor was fair, appropriate and justifiable.\n                                                                                  \n     Basic remuneration of other Higher Paid Staff, excluding employer’s Social Security and pension contributions:\n                                                                                  \n                                                  Year ended 31 July 2023 Year ended 31 July 2022\n                                                          Number           Number \n     Basic salary per annum                                                       \n     £100,000 to £104,999                                     2               5   \n     £105,000 to £109,999                                     4               7   \n     £110,000 to £114,999                                     6               4   \n                                                                                  \n     £115,000 to £119,999                                     3               2   \n     £120,000 to £124,999                                     3               8   \n     £125,000 to £129,000                                     7               1   \n     £130,000 to £134,999                                     2               2   \n     £135,000 to £139,999                                     2               -   \n                                                                                  \n     £140,000 to £144,999                                     1               1   \n     £145,000 to £149,999                                     1               -   \n     £155,000 to £159,999                                     -               2   \n     £160,000 to £164,999                                     1               -   \n     £165,000 to £169,999                                     1               -   \n                                                                                  \n     £170,000 to £174,999                                     -               1   \n     £185,000 to £189,999                                     -               1   \n     £225,000 to £229,999                                     1               -   \n     £250,000 to £254,999                                     1               1   \n     £270,000 to £274,999                                     -               1   \n                                                                                  \n                                                             35              35   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Financial Statements 2022/23                          Aston University   53",

AUPS is now a closed scheme to new entrants and future accrual and all\n     existing members now have deferred benefits.                                 \n     AUPS is a defined benefit scheme which was externally funded and for the period up to 5 April 2016 was contracted out of the State\n     Second Pension (S2P). From 6 April 2016, contracting out ceased with the introduction of the Government’s new state pension. The fund is\n     valued every three years by professionally qualified independent actuaries. The last formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31\n     March 2022.                                                                  \n     USS is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the\n     scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the assets are not attributed to\n     individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with\n     other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and\n     reasonable basis. As required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were\n     a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the\n     scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will\n     fund the overall deficit, the institution recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that\n     they relate to the deficit) with related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.\n     SWPS is a defined contribution plan, a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed contributions into a separate\n     entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension\n     plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the year during which services are rendered by employees.\n     Employment Benefits                                                          \n     Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an expense in the year in which the\n     employees render service to the University. Any unused benefits, such as holiday entitlements earned but not taken at the balance sheet\n     date, are accrued and measured as the additional amount the University expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.\n     Significant Judgements and Estimates                                         \n     Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial\n     statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:      \n     Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS)                                       \n     The University obtains a valuation from Hymans Robertson LLP who make decisions on behalf of the University on the financial\n     assumptions used to calculate the net liability of the scheme. These assumptions include the RPI%, CPI%, salary increases, pension\n     increases, mortality rates, discount rate and the estimate of the duration of employer liabilities.\n     The University allows Hymans Robertson LLP to apply their skill and judgement in setting these parameters as the pension experts rather\n     than suggesting a rate.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n     Any changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach and the full actuarial\n     valuation will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.       \n     Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)                                     \n     FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of a collection of entities under\n     common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme is a scheme for entities not under common control and\n     represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme\n     where the employer has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results in the\n     recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the\n     resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102. The directors are satisfied that USS meets the definition of a\n     multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual contributions under the recovery plan in\n     existence at the date of approving the financial statements.                 \n     The USS modeller used for calculation of the pension deficit required in the financial statements has used assumptions on staff\n     salary inflation percentages and the percentage change in staff numbers in subsequent years. In making the estimated percentages,\n     management considered past movement in salary inflation and staff numbers as well as considering the University’s strategic plans,\n     current economic climate and consistency with AUPS assumptions.              \n     Aston University has also chosen to apply the discount rate provided by Mercer Limited actuaries in the USS modeller. Mercer Limited have\n     used a set of assumptions to arrive at the discount rate with Aston University accepting the set of assumptions as reasonable.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Financial Statements 2022/23                          Aston University   67",

However auto-enrolment does apply to regular employees that have opted\n     out of AUPS or USS, or who may opt out in the future, USS pensioners and casual workers. The University has chosen to offer NEST (the\n     National Employment Savings Trust) as its workplace pension scheme for its casual workers.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Financial Statements 2022/23                          Aston University   71",

These financial risks are managed within the parameters specified by the Finance Committee approved Treasury\n     Management Policy. The treasury management policy adopts the key recommendations of the Code of Practice on Treasury Management\n     in Public Service as issued by Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) as recommended by the Office for Students\n     and is reviewed and updated annually.                                        \n     The University’s principal financial instruments are cash, investments and loans. The core objective of these financial instruments is to\n     meet the financing needs of the University’s operations. Additionally, the University has other financial assets and liabilities arising directly\n     from its operations i.e. trade debtors and creditors.                        \n     Credit risk                                                                  \n     Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the University.\n     The University’s credit risk arises from bank balances, investments, student debtors and commercial organisations as customers.\n     Management of credit risk is a prime objective of the Treasury Management Policy. At 31 July 2023, the maximum exposure is represented\n     by the carrying value of each financial asset in the balance sheet.          \n                                                                                  \n     The credit risk of liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with investment grade credit\n     ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The University’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are\n     monitored regularly. The credit exposure is limited by counterparty limits and minimum counter party credit ratings set within the Treasury\n     Management Policy.                                                           \n     Student and commercial debtors are reviewed on an-ongoing basis and a bad debt provision is made if recovery becomes uncertain.\n     If a debtor is deemed irrecoverable it is written off. Increasing numbers of self-funded students from overseas over recent years have\n     increased levels of credit risk. Despite this the concentration of risk remains limited due to a large number of diverse customers across\n     both students and commercial customer populations.                           \n     Liquidity risk                                                               \n     Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the University will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Regular monitoring of\n     liquidity risk is an essential feature of treasury management activities.    \n     Cash flow forecasts form part of the University’s 5 year strategic model and are revised during the financial year. The University policy is\n     to maintain a minimum of £10m in on-call cash balances. Excess funds are invested to maximise the return whilst observing the Treasury\n     Management Policy limits.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n     Foreign currency risk                                                        \n     Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that unfavourable movement in exchange rates may cause financial loss to the University. The\n     University’s principal foreign currency exposure is to the euro. On an annual basis after satisfying euro denominated liabilities the University\n     is left with a surplus of Euros. Surplus euros are converted at spot rates or via forward contracts that are used to mitigate the risk of\n     adverse exchange rate movements.                                             \n     Interest rate risk                                                           \n     Interest rate risk refers to the likelihood that changes in interest rates will result in fluctuations of the value of balance sheet items (i.e. price\n     risk) or changes in interest income or expenses (i.e. re-investments risk).  \n     Financial instruments – fair values                                          \n     The fair values of each category of the University’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying value in the balance sheet.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Financial Statements 2022/23                          Aston University   73",
