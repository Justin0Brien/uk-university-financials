USS\n          provides benefits based on final pensionable salary for academic and academic-related\n          employees of all UK universities and other employees. AUPS provides similarly calculated\n          benefits for other staff of the University. Whilst all of these schemes are defined benefit\n          schemes, for the reasons explained below USS is accounted for as if it were a defined\n          contribution scheme. For the other schemes FRS17 requires the deficit in the scheme to be\n          reflected in the accounts and the movements in the deficit to be reflected partly as a pension\n          cost in the Income and Expenditure account and partly in the Statement of Total Recognised\n                                                                                  \n          Gains and Losses.                                                       \n          The total pension cost for the University was:                          \n                                                             2013-14   2012-13    \n                                                                £000     £000     \n                                                                                  \n          Contributions to USS                                 9,347     8,450    \n          Contributions to AUPS including FRS 17 adjustment    2,019     1,832    \n          Contributions to LGPS in relation to closed scheme    676      (162)    \n          Enhanced Pension Provisions                            65       (21)    \n          NEST and other Pension contributions                   71        17     \n          Total Pension Cost                                                      \n                                                              12,178    10,116    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          These amounts include contributions due but not paid at the year end as follows:\n                                                              2013-14  2012-13    \n                                                                £000     £000     \n                                                                                  \n          USS                                                     13       19     \n          AUPS                                                   155      117     \n                                                                 168      136     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          Summary of FRS 17 Liabilities                                           \n                                                                                  \n          Analysis of the amount shown in the balance sheet:                      \n                                                                AUPS              \n                                                                £000              \n                                                                                  \n          Total market value of assets                         71,843             \n          Present value of scheme liabilities                 (72,789)            \n          Deficit in the scheme - Net pension liability         (946)             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Asto n University Annual Report and Financial Statements 31 July 59",

The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.\n          The institution is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the\n          scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17\n          “Retirement benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.\n          As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure account represents the\n          contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.\n                                                                                  \n          The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2014 which has not\n          yet been finalised at the time of the production of these accounts. This was the third\n          valuation for USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act\n          2004, which requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective, which is to have\n          sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical provisions.  \n                                                                                  \n          The triennial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. The assumptions\n          which have the most significant effect of the result of the valuation are those relating to the\n          rate of return on investments (i.e. the valuation rate of interest), the rates of increase in\n          salary and pensions and the assumed rates of morality. The financial assumptions were\n          derived from market yields prevailing at the valuation date. A snapshot for the period at 31\n          March 2013 reported £11.5 billion deficit between the scheme’s estimated assets and\n          liabilities. The contribution rate will be reviewed as part of each valuation and may be\n          reviewed more frequently.                                               \n                                                                                  \n          The technical provisions relate essentially to the past service liabilities and funding levels,\n          but it is also necessary to assess the ongoing cost of newly accruing benefits. The cost of\n          future accrual was calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the\n          technical provisions but the allowance for promotional salary increases was not as high.\n          Analysis has shown very variable levels of growth over and above general pay increases in\n          recent years, and the salary growth assumption built into the cost of future accrual is based\n          on more stable, historic, salary experience.                            \n          As at the valuation date the Scheme had moved to be a career revalued scheme for new\n          entrants but remains a fully final salary scheme for qualifying members and the prevailing\n          employer contribution rate was 16% of Salaries.                         \n                                                                                  \n          Following UK government legislation, from 2011 statutory pension increases or revaluations\n          are based on the Consumer Prices Index measure of price inflation. Historically these\n          increases had been based on the Retail Prices Index measure of prices inflation.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n          60                        Aston University Annual Report and Financial Statements 31 July",
