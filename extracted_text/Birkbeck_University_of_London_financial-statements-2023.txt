          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW                                                        
                                                                                  
          Foreword from Chair of Governors                                        
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck continues to have an impact, pursuing a distinctive mission, transforming lives through
          education, and contributing at the forefront of research across the full range of its academic
          breadth from the sciences to the arts.                                  
                                                                                  
          2023 is our Bicentenary and will be a time for commemoration of the past as well as reinvention
          for the future. Joanna Bourke's fine history, 'Birkbeck: 200 Years of Radical Learning for Working
          People' shows how the University, throughout its history, has had to change both to stay true to
          our mission and to survive in the face of changes in public policy, social structures and student
          aspirations.                                                            
          The University of London Act 2018 made it possible for members of the University of London to
          apply for university status in their own right, while remaining part of the federation. The granting
          of university status will not affect such things as the degrees we award, our relationships or
          contracts, but it enables us to refer to Birkbeck University where we wish to. It is particularly
          fitting that this status has been formally granted to us in our bicentenary year. The process has
          been a long one but we finally received our new Royal Charter from the Privy Council in May
          2023.                                                                   
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck is in the midst of another challenging period of change. In 2020/21 we achieved our
          highest level of new recruitment for over a decade at over 4,800 FTE. In the two years that
          followed student recruitment has been significantly lower, in the region of 3,500 FTE. There are
          reasons specific to Birkbeck and the students it serves behind this shift, but these are set
          against a backdrop of major volatility in student demand across the whole sector, particularly in
          London.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          In last year’s report we set out a framework of measures to address this situation for the future.
          The priority for the Governors this year has been to turn that framework into action, firstly by
          supporting the debate and consultation necessary to facilitate change, and then to support
          University management in planning and implementing that change. In the Vice-Chancellor’s
          report below, you will hear in more detail about the progress we have made in this process, and I
          stress that it is very much a process. There is more still to do and more still to achieve.
                                                                                  
          This has been a critical year for Birkbeck, but also a difficult and pressured one. There has been
          intense debate about its future direction, shape and organisation amongst the University
          community but also well beyond it. Birkbeck connects with people, organisations, and fellow
          higher education institutions directly through our work and, rightly, more broadly through our
          history, mission and values. In one sense we are a small institution; in other senses we are not
          and the issues we face resonate much further than Bloomsbury. Many have expressed views and
          have done so passionately and forthrightly.                             
          I would like to thank my fellow Governors for their engagement and commitment during a year
          when there have been serious debates to both listen to, and participate in, and difficult decisions
          to make. I want to recognise Birkbeck’s Senior Management Team not only for their work during
          the year but the way that work is so clearly founded on a collective loyalty and deep-rooted belief
          in the University. Finally, I want to thank the Birkbeck community as a whole. Making change
          happen has been the work of many, not just a few, and the immediate realities are experienced
          directly by everyone, especially when what we are doing is driven by imperatives of time and
          finances. Inevitably, change will be subject to question; what has never been in question is the
          commitment and dedication of our staff.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Another priority for the Governors this year has been the recruitment of our next Vice-Chancellor.
          Last year Professor David Latchman announced his intention to retire at the end of 2023 and I
          want to pay tribute here to his unprecedented 21 years of distinguished service to Birkbeck and
          his impact on the development of the University during that period. I thank him for guiding us
          through what have been turbulent times for higher education and for staying faithful to our
          founding principles.                                                    
                                                                                  
          The appointment of the Vice-Chancellor is key to the overall leadership of the University, both
          directly through their role as chief executive and far more generally; their style of leadership and
          management sets the tone for the broader culture of leadership, management and engagement
          across the institution. In this context, in August the Governors were pleased to announce the
          appointment of Professor Sally Wheeler, OBE as our new Vice-Chancellor, who will take up her
          new post on 1st January 2024.                                           
          Professor Wheeler is currently Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International and Corporate) at the
          Australian National University. She has nearly 30 years of experience in higher education
          management, encompassing leadership of both research and education at the highest levels.
          She has made significant contributions to institutional change and development in all these
          roles. She is strongly aligned to our values and our culture, having taught here earlier in her
          career.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          Professor Wheeler will join Birkbeck as it advances into its third Century - a time of ongoing
          challenge but also significant future opportunity. As Vice-Chancellor, she will lead, support and
          work with the whole Birkbeck community. Sally will be driving forward the change needed to
          secure our future; to provide the platform for financial stability, growth and confidence; and to
          ensure that we continue to deliver on our core mission. We welcome her warmly to Birkbeck.

          Chair of Governors

          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Vice-Chancellor’s Report                                                
                                                                                  
          About Birkbeck                                                          
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck is a unique London-based teaching and research institution providing access to higher
          education for traditional and non-traditional students of all ages. Our students face the reality of
          competing priorities and calls on their time. From 18 to 61+ (nearly 300 of our students were
          over 61 in 2022/23), they are living their lives with all the commitments that entails. Often, they
          are working, have caring or other responsibilities. Our job is to make sure that in doing all that,
          they can benefit from higher education, not miss out on it.             
          Our student body is diverse with 44% from ethnic minority backgrounds and 57% women in
          2022/23. As well as serving the needs of Londoners, we have a growing international student
          community now welcoming students from over 140 countries around the world.
                                                                                  
          Our aim is to provide high quality teaching in the context of excellent research and have that
          proposition at the forefront of our access and widening participation agenda. Birkbeck was
          successful in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) return with 83% of our research
          being rated either ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*).
                                                                                  
          Student recruitment                                                     
                                                                                  
          The recruitment picture has remained challenging. Following a high point in 2020/21 when new
          admissions totalled 4,819 FTE, 2021/22 saw recruitment at a significantly lower level: 3,493
          FTE. In 2023, whilst new admissions did not decline further, they did not increase and totalled
          3,500 FTE. In the main this was due to strong contributions from our international recruitment
          efforts and the significant expansion of our January Start programmes.  
                                                                                  
          A very clear part of our strategy post-Brexit has been to focus on, and significantly increase,
          international recruitment. Thus, it was encouraging to see significant progress here in 2022/23.
          International recruitment was up significantly from 706 FTE in 2021/22 to 1,070 FTE in
          2022/23, leading to our highest ever number of international students. As well as growth at
          postgraduate Masters level where international recruitment has been previously concentrated we
          had an increased cohort of international undergraduates as well. Our expanded offer of
          programmes starting in January and providing an alternative entry point are also proving
          attractive and a positive addition to our course portfolio. We recruited 324 FTE to these
          programmes in 2022/23 compared to 155 FTE the year before.              
          The nationwide downturn in the number of adult learners and part-timers entering higher
          education later in life has continued at undergraduate as well as postgraduate level and the
          trends and factors underlying that continue to play out. The long-term downward trend resulting
          from poor maintenance support and older students’ aversion to the debt associated with higher
          fees has been amplified by post-Covid factors and the extended timescale for the implementation
          of the Lifelong Learning Entitlement. New and emerging patterns of work in London and across
          the UK, as well as immediate and challenging economic circumstances. are determining the way
          mature learners want to study and, just as importantly, their capacity to commit to study now.
                                                                                  
          The indications from the 2023/24 recruitment cycle, are that building back recruitment will be
          the work of a number of years, not one or two. The current issues across the sector in relation to
          international student recruitment are a reminder of the volatility and risk in the international
          market and that that there is no single quick fix to be relied on.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Instead, there is the reality of the hard work necessary to adapt, develop and innovate our course
          portfolio, the way we deliver and teach it and where, how and with what message and offer we
          reconnect with the Birkbeck students of the future. We need to, and are, shifting perspectives
          and challenging thinking that is rooted in the circumstances of the past, not directed to the
          future.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck students are often thought of in terms of their age, but the fact that we have over many
          years recruited, for example, undergraduates later in life, is a reflection of the opportunities, or
          rather lack of them in the broader higher education landscape and the consequent life choices
          our students have taken in response. Things change. Birkbeck students, or rather the students
          Birkbeck exists to serve, are not ultimately defined by age; they are defined by the circumstances
          and the struggles they face, the ambition they have, and their commitment to achieve it. Whether
          18, 28, or 38, we will find them. We need to attract them with the compelling study offer that
          fulfils that ambition, matches that commitment and fits with those circumstances.
          Current operating position                                              
                                                                                  
          The 2022/23 total comprehensive income for the year was £1.9 million. This compares to a
          comprehensive expenditure of £10.8 million in the previous year. The outturn itself and how it
          relates to last year is impacted significantly by changes in the USS pension liability, by changes to
          severance costs and by the impact of property disposals last year. 2022/23 saw an £8.2 million
          reduction in our share of the USS liability, compared to an increase in the liability of £20.4 million
          the year before. Severance costs this year were £3.9 million, up by £1.4 million, reflecting the
          significant work undertaken on reducing staff costs during 2022/23. The prior year figures also
          included the £13.9 million profit on the sale of our property Egmont House, which was surplus to
          requirements following a reconfiguration of our estate to support agile working for our
          professional services staff.                                            
                                                                                  
          Our underlying operating deficit for 2022/23 was £2.2 million (2021/22: underlying deficit of
          £0.5 million) which reflects the ongoing impact of the significant fall in student numbers in
          2021/22 and the repeat of recruitment at that lower level in 2022/23 (see Table 4).
                                                                                  
          The impact of our recruitment challenge is magnified by the structural financial issues that are
          playing out across the sector. Annual increases in staff costs - due to promotions, inflationary
          increases, increment advancement and pension costs - exceed the inflationary increase in our
          main source of income, primarily due to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate
          tuition fees. The continued cap on home undergraduate tuition fees is affecting the whole higher
          education sector in England. The £9,250 fee is now worth over a third less than it was when it
          was introduced in 2012 and with inflation running at the current high level the pressure placed
          on universities to generate an excess of income over expenditure is intense.
          We have not stood by in the face of these circumstances, however, but taken concerted action
          wherever we can to improve the position. The deficit is not what we want but it is significantly
          better in relation to the budget and forecast position with which we started the year. This reflects
          focussed effort in relation to cost management, particularly in relation to staff costs. We have
          delivered savings through pay restraint, vacancy management and controls on recruitment. In
          addition, as well as making savings for the long-term we have been able to make some of those
          savings earlier during the year. We have worked hard to boost our other income and have
          benefited from a strong recovery in income linked to the use of our estate and the renting of
          space. Higher interest rates have improved the return on our investments whilst also contributing
          to the improved performance of the Universities Superannuation Scheme resulting in lower
          future contribution rates.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Progress in implementing our recovery plan                              
                                                                                  
          With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23,
          Birkbeck recognised it faced immediate challenges which required concerted action.
                                                                                  
          The University’s plans for 2022/23 focused on the following:            
                                                                                  
             • introduction of a new academic structure that maintains academic breadth, whilst
               creating larger more sustainable groupings for the future which are better aligned to
               opportunities for growth and which are supported by simplified, more focussed
               management structures and roles;                                   
             • linked to the academic re-organisation, a review and restructuring of our arrangements
               for student facing administration services and support;            
                                                                                  
             • the development of a more competitive flexible Birkbeck course offer;
                                                                                  
             • the rollout of new simplified teaching models for undergraduate and postgraduate
               provision; and                                                     
                                                                                  
             • investment in a flexible blend of campus and digital experience, designed to give our
               diverse student community the opportunities they deserve in a form that recognises their
               changed circumstances and needs.                                   
                                                                                  
          In terms of the immediate financial challenges linked to student recruitment we have been
          working closely with Governors to confirm the immediate steps in our recovery plan and during
          2022/23 Governors agreed the following key actions:                     
                                                                                  
            •  a reduction in staff costs of £12 million over two years to bring costs back into alignment
               with reduced tuition income;                                       
                                                                                  
            •  increased income totalling £15 million by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new
               modes of delivery (including classes taking place simultaneously on campus and online),
               rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes more
               attractive, plus some additional third-stream income; and          
                                                                                  
            •  a reduction in the size of our estate. Having purchased the building adjacent to our main
               campus site as part of our strategy to provide improved learning and teaching facilities
               for our staff and students we are in a position to dispose of estate assets that are less
               suited to our future needs.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Organisational change and cost savings                                  
                                                                                  
          On the 1st of August 2023, the University moved from its old, 5 School, 19 Department academic
          structure, to a new streamlined model, focussed around 3 larger Faculties – of Science, Business
          and Law, and Humanities & Social Sciences. Each Faculty is composed of larger Schools
          (replacing Departments), in total 8, which have brought together disciplines in configurations that
          support continuing academic breadth whilst ensuring efficient and effective scale.
          Allied to this, and to the same timescale, we have re-organised the student-facing professional
          services staff based within our Faculties, moving from a highly generalist, primarily local and
          departmentally based structure to a Faculty based structure with roles defined specifically
          around the delivery of teaching, the support of students, and separate roles supporting functional
          areas such as finance, human resources and governance.                  
                                                                                  
          Broad organisational reform has gone hand-in-hand with refreshing and renewing academic
          leadership and management roles, creating a streamlined and professionalised structure where
          academic colleagues take on Head of School and Faculty Director positions as substantive roles,
          supported by appropriate training and professional development. Reform has not stopped there.
          A remodelled senior management team has been constituted, now operating as the University
          Executive Board, to provide more focussed leadership for change across the University.
                                                                                  
          This set of changes represents the culmination of concerted debate and consultation within the
          University and outside it. It also represents the hard work of many hands, committed to making it
          happen to the timescale demanded, to whom the University owes a significant debt of thanks.
          Whilst there have been considerable challenges on both sides, the University has worked
          constructively with its recognised Trade Unions - UCU, UNISON and UNITE - throughout this
          period.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The purpose of the re-organisation was to deliver both a better structure but also significant staff
          savings within it. We have done so, achieving the £8 million of savings scheduled for 2023/24.
          £6 million of academic staff savings have been achieved for the 2023/24 financial year and,
          similarly, £2 million of savings from professional services. Some of these savings were achieved
          sooner than expected contributing to an improved operating position 2022/23. Whilst this
          outcome can be simply described, for the University it has been a hard and difficult path to tread.
          I can report that all the savings were achieved through voluntary means, with no compulsory
          redundancies. That is important but we have all been confronted with the sobering reality of
          many long-standing colleagues – colleagues who have contributed much to our community -
          leaving us during the year. There is no doubt though that these savings are vital to our future and
          as noted already, they were critical to deliver as soon as practical thereby creating the time to
          adapt and reposition ourselves in relation to the changes in student demand with which we have
          been confronted.                                                        
          Our organisational changes necessarily have delivered significant savings but that categorically is
          not their only purpose and scope. They lay the foundation for a Birkbeck that can build and take
          advantage of its opportunities for the future, not just survive in its present. There are some key
          themes to that transformation. Birkbeck is a small institution and in the current climate there are
          challenges associated with that. Whilst we cannot compensate for all the disadvantages
          associated with size we should be able to play to the advantages of smaller scale. Complexity,
          fragmentation, and operational variation have stood in our way. They have stopped us from being
          the responsive, agile and innovative place we need to be. The simplification of structure,
          management, lines of communication and operation are designed to give us back this advantage
          for the future.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Repositioning our course offer and the delivery of our teaching         
                                                                                  
          Our starting point for change has been at the level of strategy. We have a refreshed and renewed
          education strategy that sets our clearly the steps, interconnections and complex dependencies
          that underpin the major change to which we are committing and the journey that involves. In
          2022/23 we have made progress in the following areas.                   
                                                                                  
          In October 2022 Birkbeck was awarded £3 million in capital funding by the Office for Students,
          (OfS) as joint funding for a programme of linked projects entitled Creating Inclusive Learning
          (CIL). This project is core to our strategy to invest in and deliver our teaching through a flexible
          blend of campus and digital experience. The driving force behind this initiative is to give our
          diverse student community the opportunities they deserve in a form that recognises their
          changed circumstances and needs.                                        
          The project has two strands:                                            
                                                                                  
            •  HyFlex teaching– adaptation of our classrooms (particularly in relation to IT and AV)
               enabling students to choose whether they join their classes in-person or join the same
               class online whilst providing a high-quality interactive learning experience in both modes.
                                                                                  
            •  Virtual Reality & Immersive Learning (VRIL) – the use of Virtual Reality in purpose-built
               spaces to enhance the range and scope of our teaching and support for the longer term.
               This will deliver genuine innovation through new types of course content and new ways of
               teaching and interacting with our students.                        
                                                                                  
          In 2022/23 the project focused on research, pilot and evaluation work which culminated in the
          development of a clear specification of the equipment required for high quality HyFlex delivery
          and an invitation to tender for this work. The pilot work was sufficiently rigorous to enable us to
          offer a suite of HyFlex pilot programmes for the 2023/24 academic year. 
                                                                                  
          Alongside our longer-term development of HyFlex – the ability to bring together our physical and
          virtual classrooms - we have also re-configured a suite of programmes to be ‘flexible masters’. At
          this point, this means that students can choose to study entirely online, in-person, or a
          combination of both and separate groups are provided for different learning modes where
          appropriate. This has proved successful and popular. In 2022/23 21% of our Master’s students
          were enrolled on these programmes.                                      
          We have undertaken an extensive portfolio redesign laying the ground work for a move to a more
          simplified, flexible and attractive mix of undergraduate and postgraduate courses starting from
          2023/24. We built on the work to digitally transform our virtual learning environment in response
          to the pandemic to create courses that provide a blend of excellent interactive teaching sessions
          and the highest quality asynchronous online learning materials available to our diverse body of
          students 24 hours a day 7 days a week.                                  
                                                                                  
          Our new pathway system aims to create choice within subject areas in a way which constrains
          some elements of module choice but creates more coherent programmes, stronger cohorts of
          students and choice in the flexibility of delivery. This work has also created greater economies of
          scale, whilst maintaining Birkbeck’s broad academic subject base.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Our new course design principles aim to simplify the framework for learning, teaching and
          assessment and to create greater uniformity in the structure of our programmes of study with a
          focus on programme-level thinking and team teaching. Core objectives for the new model
          address student feedback about preferences for attendance and greater consistency of student
          experience across subject areas. Students are now taught over three terms and are assessed at
          the end of the term in which teaching content is taught. The portfolio redesign work resulted in a
          25% reduction in the number of modules and programme variants whilst maintaining a broad
          portfolio.                                                              
          Looking forward                                                         
                                                                                  
          We are now focussing on the following immediate priorities.             
                                                                                  
          Daytime teaching in a small number of subject areas where there is high potential demand.
          Drawing on successful pilots in Law and Science, we will offer teaching in a small range of
          defined afternoon slots, alongside the existing evening timetable, in subject areas where there is
          clear evidence of largescale market demand.                             
                                                                                  
          We will offer students in these areas of largescale demand the choice between an afternoon and
          an evening offer, with study organised around two or three days campus attendance a week. As
          with evening teaching sessions, day-time study will be supported with rich online learning
          resources.                                                              
                                                                                  
          Pilots will be run in Business, Management, Law, Psychology and Biomedicine, in the current
          recruitment cycle and they will be promoted with a clearly segmented marketing campaign.
          Market analysis indicates that this model should appeal to younger commuter students in
          Greater London and its immediate hinterland combining study with other commitments and our
          location and reputation will enable us to take some of this growing cohort from other providers.
                                                                                  
          Building our international market. Daytime teaching also gives us the opportunity to change our
          approach to international recruitment. Cambridge Education Group (CEG) have taught large
          cohorts of international students on introductory/foundation level programmes on our campus
          during the day, but these students have tended to move on to other University of London
          institutions as there has been no natural feed through onto our programmes. A positive
          relationship built over time around provision of space and services has the potential to deliver
          much more. We are creating a formal progression agreement that guarantees recognition of CEG
          qualifications as entry points onto our degrees in cognate areas (Business, Management and
          Law).                                                                   
          We are also changing the way we operate with recruitment agents. Alongside our existing
          approach, we will be trialling a new model for 2024 involving a major largescale recruitment
          partner with the infrastructure and capacity to support recruitment across multiple regions and
          markets with targets for a major additional contribution to recruitment. Learning from these
          tactical changes will allow us to pursue further strategic partnership opportunities both locally
          and internationally.                                                    
                                                                                  
          New programmes. We will be launching new programmes across the University in 2024 and
          2025, bringing together academic creativity with market research. These programmes include
          new provision in Health and Wellbeing, Business, Data Analytics, Natural Sciences and Social
          and Political Sciences, which are now open for entry in autumn 2024 with further new initiatives
          being planned for entry in 2025.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          HyFlex. We are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and facilities that will enable us to reach
          new students through HyFlex delivery with teaching simultaneously taking place on campus and
          online. This innovation means that in our areas of major academic and research strength we will
          be able to open our cutting-edge Masters provision at distance across the UK, as well as to those
          able to attend classes in central London.                               
                                                                                  
          Developing, rethinking and resizing our estate                          
          Our starting point for change has once again been to define our strategy, setting out strategic
          principles.                                                             
                                                                                  
          We have committed to create a connected campus clearly focussed on our main Torrington
          Square site, rationalising our other estate holdings to create the foundation for a future estate
          that can be sustainable, both environmentally and financially. Linked to our education strategy
          we will work towards all Birkbeck classes being delivered in Birkbeck classrooms, recognising
          that to deliver the learning experience we want we need to have tight integration between our
          physical estate and our digital infrastructure including direct control over both.
                                                                                  
          Our aim through development, investment and the co-location of facilities and services is to
          create a campus environment that supports a transformational student experience alongside
          modern facilities that underpin the excellence of our research. We will do that by focussing on
          the development and refurbishment of the adjacent buildings that now run the full length of
          Torrington Square to the West: Birkbeck Central, the Torrington Square Main Building, and, in the
          longer-term, the redevelopment of the Main Building extension.          
                                                                                  
          We will retain our existing buildings around Torrington Square to the East – the Wohl Wolfson
          Toddler Lab, the Clore Management Centre, and the Henry Wellcome Building - to support our
          connected campus, creating a clear Birkbeck presence and identity around the Square.
                                                                                  
          In this context we have progressed the identification of options for the location of our teaching,
          our staff and our key infrastructure and facilities. This is now allowing us to pursue various
          opportunities for estate asset sales that support both our overall financial position and provide
          long-term capacity for strategic investment.                            
          We have continued with our planning for the progressive development of Birkbeck Central as the
          focus for investment in the student experience. Our Estates and IT Teams have worked in close
          collaboration on the initial phases of our HyFlex teaching project.     
                                                                                  
          This year, we have created more dedicated space that supports agile, hybrid working, bringing
          the professional services teams in our new Faculties together to enable more collaborative
          working in modern flexible and highly efficient workspaces.             
                                                                                  
          In pursuit of the connected campus agenda we have identified opportunities to improve the
          public realm environment surrounding our estate and the overall visual identity and wayfinding.
          We have been successful in securing external funding to support our environmental and
          sustainability agenda and this will give further impetus to our work on heat decarbonisation.

          The ongoing generosity of alumni, friends, corporate partners, and charitable trusts and
          foundations allows the University to continue amplifying its commitment to ensuring access to
          higher education, enabling us to best support our student community to succeed academically
          and helping to widen the impact of our world leading research. Our alumni, partners and friends
          play a vital role in advocating, supporting and volunteering for the University.
          Last year, over £1.8 million of new philanthropic income was committed to Birkbeck. This
          included hundreds of donors making regular monthly gifts, as well as multiple six and five figure
          gifts from individuals, corporates and charitable foundations.

          These donations will support a range of priority areas across the University such as:
                                                                                  
             •  widening access to education and enhancing student support by strengthening financial
                support offerings around bursaries, scholarships and hardship funding and enriching
                pastoral care such as careers advice, wellbeing services and community outreach;
             •  academic research and PhD studentships through initiatives like the Research
                Innovation Fund which provides seed funding for new research ideas, post-doctoral
                awards for emerging academics and PhD scholarships for the next generation of
                academic thinkers;                                                
                                                                                  
             •  capital projects, facilities and equipment by improving our provision of technology
                enhanced learning, supporting state of the art equipment for our researchers and
                contributing towards infrastructure projects that enrich the Birkbeck learning
                experience; and                                                   
                                                                                  
             •  funding for areas of greatest need where our donors understand the importance of
                flexible funding to respond to the changing needs of our community and to enable us to
                move quickly on innovative new projects.

          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Chart 2: Summary of activities to be supported by donations             
                                                                                  
          In the last year, support for The World Needs More Birkbeck campaign has continued. The
          University’s first ever comprehensive fundraising and engagement campaign is deepening our
          relationships with current supporters and attracting new donors to support Birkbeck's ambitions.
                                                                                  
          In addition to supporting the University financially, our alumni and friends play an important role
          in aiding student recruitment, retention and employability initiatives. Last year we continued to
          see more students benefiting from the support, guidance and advice given by our growing
          community of valued volunteers. Through flagship volunteering programmes such as Mentoring
          Pathways, Global Buddies and Career Clinics 460 students benefited from support, guidance and
          advice given by 351 volunteers, a total of 5,457 hours of time. This included time given by 126
          corporate volunteers from organisations including Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, PwC, Clifford Chance
          and the Arts Council England.                                           
          The post-pandemic economic recovery, global turbulence and ongoing cost-of -living crisis means
          that many of our students, alumni and donors are facing new challenges and uncertain times
          ahead. During our 200th Anniversary year, we were proud that our existing community continued
          to come together to provide vital funding and expertise to ensure that Birkbeck students and
          researchers continue to have access to the tools, support and services that enable them to thrive
          and succeed at Birkbeck and beyond.                                     
                                                                                  
          As we underwent our strategic organisational review so that the institution could be in a stronger
          position to thrive as we entered our third century, it was not immune to the uncertainty and
          impacts associated with any such large-scale change programme. Although existing donor
          support remained strong, there was inevitably a knock-on effect on the generation of new
          philanthropic income from individuals, corporates and foundations. However, we are encouraged
          by the healthy pipeline of future funding support that we have identified which will enable us to
          return to our previous funding levels.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck’s 200th Anniversary commemorations programme has also seen strong alumni and
          supporter engagement across the University. Organised by the alumni engagement team,
          hundreds of alumni, staff, students and friends attended the first four of our 200th Anniversary
          Leadership lecture series in person and online. Covering a range of topical issues aligned with
          our founding mission, the series has included: ‘Creating a More Equitable Tech Sector’, a panel
          discussion chaired by Birkbeck Governor Rachel Neaman with senior representatives from
          Google and Meta; and an inspirational lecture on ‘The Dramaturgy of Leadership’ by actor and
          playwright, Kwame Kwei-Armah. The Anniversary Lectures have been complemented by a series
          of alumni celebratory gatherings in fifteen cities across the globe and those organised by several
          departments to mark this special year in Birkbeck’s history.            
          Gender pay gap                                                          
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck supports the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and is committed to
          operating a pay system that is transparent, based on objective criteria, free from bias and which
          rewards staff in line with the University commitment to equality and diversity. The Gender Pay
          Gap report is produced each year as part of our ongoing commitment to monitor gender equality
          and diversity pay issues in our workforce. We have been publishing equal pay audits since 2009
          and continue this practice in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010
          (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on certain
          metrics annually.                                                       
                                                                                  
          In addition to the mandatory annual Gender Pay Gap report, Birkbeck also undertakes a full pay
          audit periodically (most recently April 2022) to provide analysis and recommendations in relation
          to reward and related management strategies, policies and practices across the institution. This
          report considers the pay of staff with other protected characteristics.

          Although we are pleased that the mean gender pay gap has fallen to 5.9% and is one of the
          lowest in the sector we remain committed to further progress on equal pay and have set out both

          Birkbeck operates several contribution related schemes which are tailored to reflect the different
          conditions required to accumulate the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to
          demonstrate excellence within a role. All schemes formally take account of personal
          circumstances, and all committee members undertake both formal Equality & Diversity and
          unconscious bias training. Reward scheme data is reviewed annually by Birkbeck for equality &
          diversity issues in application and success rates.                      
                                                                                  
          74% of bonus payments made in 2022 were staff contributions directly related to the COVID
          pandemic. Therefore, the figures for this period are not a true reflection of year-on-year trends.
                                                                                  
          The distribution of men and women across the highest to lowest paid staff groups inverts in
          favour of men and is not uncommon in the Higher Education sector. Our commitment to equal
          pay for work of equal value minimises the horizontal pay gap within grades meaning the
          population distribution is the most significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. Targeted
          actions from previous pay reviews and other gender analysis activities, such as Athena
          Swan, have been identified and put in place to address population imbalances.
                                                                                  
          Although the vertical gender pay gap remains 2022 saw another small shift towards greater
          gender equality. For the top quartile in 2020 46.8% of staff were female. This increased to 48.9%
          in March 2021 and 49.3% in 2022.

          The Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1
          April 2017 and require public sector employers to collate and publish, on an annual basis, a
          range of data on the amount and cost of facility time within their organisation. Facility time is the
          provision of paid or unpaid time off from an employee’s normal role to undertake trade union
          duties and activities as a union representative. Trade unions play an important role in the
          modern workplace and there are significant benefits to both employers and employees when
          organisations and unions work together effectively. The regulations provide a framework for open
          and transparent monitoring of this. The facility time data for the relevant period is shown below.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023

          This will be my last Vice-Chancellor’s report. I will retire from my position at the end of December
          2023. It has been a huge privilege to serve as Birkbeck’s Vice-Chancellor since 2003. I have
          been fully committed to putting in place the changes necessary to secure the future of Birkbeck
          and in leading the University through this critical period. The concerted response to the
          challenges we face highlighted in this report has been a team effort and University-wide
          endeavour: the work of many dedicated colleagues, working with the support of our Governors. I
          thank all those who have contributed so much. I wish our new Vice-Chancellor well. In the
          Birkbeck community, I know she will find the collective commitment and spirit to take the
          University forward through current challenges and into its third century.

          Financial Review                                                        
                                                                                  
          The Financial Statements presented to the Governors only comprise the results of the University.
          Prior to 2022/23 the consolidated Financial Statements also included the results of a wholly
          owned subsidiary which was closed in 2022. The principal activities undertaken by the University
          are teaching and research together with ancillary activities necessary to facilitate this. Additional
          activities include rendering academic services to a variety of educational, commercial and other
          organisations.                                                          
                                                                                  
          The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of
          Recommended Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in
          accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard
          applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and,
          therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit requirement of FRS 102. The Financial
          Statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention (modified by the
          revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).      
          The completion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, global recovery from the
          effects of the pandemic, geopolitical events and increases in inflation have had a significant
          effect on families, businesses, and economies in the last few years. Despite a swift and
          successful move to on-line learning during lockdown student numbers fell significantly in
          2021/22 and have not recovered since. This has led to direct and indirect financial
          consequences for Birkbeck and increased risks as we try and assess an uncertain future.
                                                                                  
          Although we need to rapidly address a financial position where costs exceed income we are not
          alone in the UK HE sector. Government regulated tuition fees for Home undergraduate students
          remain fixed at £9,250 despite rapidly rising costs. The erosion in value of the fee that can be
          charged is placing considerable strain on the budgets of all universities in England. This Financial
          Review will comment on our performance for the year and the financial impact of pension and
          other adjustments which contribute to the Statement of Comprehensive Income & Expenditure
          and Statement of Financial Position.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The recurrent teaching grant from the government continues to fall and fell by a further £0.5
          million in 2022/23. Teaching grant now represents only 2.1% of total income in comparison with
          47.5% in 2005/06. In contrast, income from academic fees has risen from 25.7% in 2005/06 to
          62.2% in 2022/23. Tuition income fell by £2.5 million this year on top of an £8.4 million fall in
          2021/22. 2020/21 saw a spike in applications from EU students wishing to benefit from the
          final year of UK government tuition fee loans and this increase was replaced by a significant
          reduction the following year as EU students had to pay their own fees – an outcome seen across
          the sector not just at Birkbeck. The fall in new student numbers between 2020/21 and 2021/22
          has a knock-on effect on future years as larger graduating cohorts of undergraduates are
          replaced by lower incoming groups of students. Whilst incoming student numbers were similar in
          2021/22 and 2022/23 the numbers of returners fell by around 650 due to the cohort effect.
          Recurrent grant from Research England rose by £1.2 million (10.9%) primarily due to additional
          non-recurrent grant funding to help offset the negative impact of not being associated with
          Horizon Europe. We are pleased that UK universities are once again able to collaborate with
          partners under the programme following the announcement that agreement had been reached in
          September 2023. Externally funded research activity returned to pre-pandemic levels as
          restrictions on movement (and, therefore, research activity) were relaxed post-Covid. Overall, the
          total amount of grant and fee income remained similar this year (a net fall of £71,000).
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck primarily provides teaching to its students in the evening and rents much of its space to
          other universities during the daytime. With lockdown and ongoing safety restrictions limiting the
          activities which could take place on campus, other income was depressed during 2020/21 with
          a partial recovery in 2021/22. Income from lettings, catering and conferences rose by a further
          £1.8 million in 2022/23 (2021/22: a rise of £2.0 million) almost returning to pre-pandemic
          levels.                                                                 
                                                                                  
          Increasing interest rates from recent historic lows has had a positive impact on investment
          income which increased by £0.9 million this year. Rates are expected to fall slowly over the
          coming years. Governors agreed a new investment strategy in 2019/20 which aims to support
          our core business activities, purchase of capital equipment, infrastructure improvements and our
          estates strategy. £10.0 million was invested in two externally managed funds with strong
          Environmental, Social and Governance criteria embedded in investment decision making. Both
          funds performed remarkably well and In November 2021 combined gains of £4.0 million were
          realised and converted into cash with both funds reset to £10.0 million. Equity values have
          subsequently fallen with an unrealised loss on investments of £0.3 million (2021/22: unrealised
          gain of £0.3 million) being recorded.

          *Undergraduate degree with a foundation year studied in a full-time mode
          The dramatic decline in part-time undergraduate students since the government increased the
          maximum fee which universities could charge to Home undergraduates to £9,000 in 2012
          appeared to have plateaued but further falls have now been experienced in the last two years.
          We are pleased that the Lifelong Learning Entitlement (previously Lifelong Loan Entitlement) is
          scheduled to be introduced from 2025 albeit with a phased approach to modular delivery. We
          are generally supportive of measures aimed at relaxing the apprenticeship levy criteria thereby
          enabling businesses to support a wider range of skills training through part-time and short
          courses. It is clear that re-skilling and up-skilling of the UK workforce in key areas is a core part of
          both national and local government strategies and we will be developing new programmes and
          modes of delivery to further support the ambitions of part time students.
          Historically, postgraduate numbers have increased at points of economic downturn and this
          occurred again in 2020/21 as a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic. Lockdown
          restrictions clearly contributed to the significant rise in Home students commencing a Masters
          programme: students had time available to study so took the opportunity to study as a means to
          upskill or retrain with an eye on improving career prospects during a post-pandemic (and post-
          Brexit) recovery. This increase was reversed in 2021/22 in part due to positive employment rates
          in London and the cost pressures of high inflation. International students drove an increase in
          full time postgraduate enrolments whilst Home enrolments studying full and part-time fell further.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Income from full-time Home students fell by £3.3 million in 2022/23 as mature students in
          particular delayed the commencement of education as employment levels and inflation rose.
          Conversely, income from international students rose by £5.1 million as international travel
          returned to normal and some of the latent demand following the pandemic was met. Income
          from part-time students fell by £3.5 million following the fall of £4.2 million in 2021/22.
                                                                                  
          We have seen a continuing upward trend in the number of students looking to complete a
          foundation year before progressing on to year one of a degree programme. Many of our students
          return to study later in life and often did not achieve A-levels or equivalent earlier in life. We were
          extremely disappointed when the Government announced that from 2025/26 the maximum fee
          allowable for foundation year provision would be £5,670 rather than £9,250. We believe that the
          foundation year is critical from an equality perspective and remain committed to delivering the
          programmes. This fee reduction, coupled with the continuing freeze in the maximum fee we are
          able to charge undergraduate Home students, will deepen the funding gap between the cost of
          teaching a student and the fee received with an inevitable impact on the services we wish to
          provide. This financial challenge is being faced by all universities and is unsustainable for a
          sector which is fundamental to the success of the UK and its economy.

          A significant proportion of our budget is focussed on academic and related services - 2022/23:
          63.8% of total expenditure compared with 58.0% in 2018/19. Over the same five-year time
          period administrative and professional costs have been kept at broadly the same level only
          increasing by £1.7 million (now representing 20.8% of expenditure compared with 18.2% in
          2018/19).                                                               
                                                                                  
          The ratio of staff costs to total income (excluding movements in the pension provision and
          restructuring costs) is a helpful metric to review when considering financial sustainability. In
          general, restructuring costs should be included in this metric but are excluded from Table 3
          allowing for better year-on-year comparison. The University does not own any student residences
          (which increase income without a corresponding material increase in staff costs) so this
          percentage remains one of the highest in the sector.

          Chart 8: Staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) and tuition income 2014/15 to 2022/23
          Tuition fees and education contracts provided 64.3% of total income in 2022/23 (2021/22:
          66.8%) whilst staff costs (excluding pension provision and restructuring) represent 68.4% of total
          income (2021/22: 68.9%). With Home undergraduate fees fixed by the UK government the
          annual increases in staff costs through promotions, incremental drift and pay award create a
          mismatch between the inflationary increase in income and the additional staff costs. The
          underlying pressure is currently exacerbated by historically high inflation increasing costs.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Until 2017/18, the trajectory of our main source of income was tracking the rise in staff costs
          and the University delivered regular surpluses. A post-Brexit referendum fall in students enrolling
          from the EU coupled with increasing pension costs switched this around as indicated in Chart 8
          and directly led to the underlying deficit in 2018/19. We saw a significant switch in 2020/21 due
          to the pandemic-influenced spike in tuition income and a surplus was delivered. Unfortunately,
          the fall in new student enrolments in 2021/22 immediately reversed the trend – a trend which
          has continued into 2022/23.                                             
          Chart 8 graphically illustrates the financial challenge the University faces: with a heavy reliance
          on tuition income, and an inability to increase the Home undergraduate fee, the University must
          increase student numbers each year to offset cost inflation. With such a high percentage of our
          costs currently invested in our staff we are unable to quickly adapt our cost base to a reduction in
          our primary income stream. Following the recent fall in student numbers and income we had no
          choice but to develop plans to reduce our staff establishment. The first phase of this difficult
          process was completed in 2022/23 with £9.0 million of staff cost savings identified through a
          combination of voluntary severance, early retirement and vacancy management. The full year
          effect of the savings will be felt in 2023/24 although vacancy management delivered an in-year
          variance against budget of around £3.0 million. Restructuring costs of £3.9 million were required
          to deliver the staff savings.                                           
                                                                                  
          Unlike a number of universities, we continue to apply the sector pay award in full when it is
          announced. This included the early payment in 2022/23 of part of the 2023/24 award which
          added an additional £0.6 million in unbudgeted staff costs. We also remain committed to paying
          the London Living Wage from the first day of the month following the announcement of any
          increase.                                                               
                                                                                  
          The University Superannuation Scheme (USS) was revalued at 31 March 2020 with the effect
          that the scheme deficit increased. Employee benefits were reduced and a repayment plan was
          agreed in 2021/22. This deficit recovery plan increased our share of the pension liability by
          £20.3 million with a corresponding reduction to the comprehensive income for the year. At 31
          July 2023 the assumptions which underpin the calculation of the pension liability had improved
          with our share of the liability estimated to fall to £29.0 million – resulting in a corresponding
          increase in comprehensive income for the year of £8.2 million. The instability of the scheme over
          recent years and the impact on contribution rates is highlighted in Table 3a.

          As can be seen from Table 3a, the Universities Superannuation Scheme has become more costly
          over time with the University contribution rate 35% higher in 2022/23 than it was in early 2016.
          Additional covenant support was provided to USS by employers and benefits to members were
          reduced to ensure that the 2020 valuation was concluded without unaffordable increases in
          contributions being enforced.

          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          The latest triennial valuation was undertaken as at 31 March 2023 and determined that
          movements in valuation assumptions had improved the position significantly such that the
          scheme deficit of £14.1 billion assessed at 31 March 2020 had changed to a surplus of £7.4
          billion at 31 March 2023. The 2023 valuation has recommended that contribution rates can fall
          significantly whilst benefits can also be restored to those in place prior to the 2020 valuation.
          Our share of the scheme liability will be reversed in 2023/24 once the 2023 USS valuation has
          been formally approved. Table 3b summarises the movement in the share of our USS pension
          liability over the last seven years.

           at 31 July                                                             
                                                                                  
          Table 3b: Key data for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)     
                                                                                  
          The higher pension liability calculated at 31 July 2022 led to an increase in the notional interest
          charged on the liability in 2022/23 to £1.2 million (2021:22: £147,000). We should see a
          significant reduction in this figure in 2023/24 once the 2023 valuation concludes and the
          liability is reversed in full.                                          
                                                                                  
          Governors have long been concerned about the risk the scheme places on the financial health of
          the University and the periodic uncertainty that the valuations introduce. They are also mindful of
          the fact that around 20% of eligible staff nationally have chosen not to be members of USS with
          many citing that the contribution rates are unaffordable. The positive outcome of the 2023
          valuation should introduce a period of stability for all and we remain supportive of plans to
          develop alternate, flexible pension options for staff within USS.       
                                                                                  
          Non-staff cost budgets were reduced in autumn 2022 when we realised that student recruitment
          would remain flat and budget managers adapted and carefully monitored their spend plans
          identifying further savings throughout the year. The provision for doubtful debts provides an
          assessment at the end of each year as to the proportion of student related debt which may be
          unlikely to be recovered. The provision increased by £1.0 million over 2021/22 to £4.3 million
          almost certainly as a consequence of the challenge many of our students are facing as inflation
          and interest rates have risen significantly. Although this will impact all students in the UK our
          more mature students are also likely to have mortgages and family costs to manage.
          International students, particularly those from our core market in Nigeria, may have seen a
          significant reduction in the value of their local currency against Sterling making the cost of
          studying in the UK more expensive. The University was protected from the significant increases in
          energy costs of the last couple of years having entered a fixed price contract. This contract ended
          in autumn 2023 and a rise of around £1.0 million is expected in 2023/24. Although other
          operating expenses rose by £1.8 million compared with 2021/22 this represented a saving
          against the revised budget of £1.0 million.                             
          During the year we decided to terminate a loan facility we had arranged in 2020/21. Due to the
          fall in student numbers we agreed to pause and review our estates strategy determining that

          improvements to our assets and infrastructure. The loan facility was undrawn with only a
          commitment fee being incurred each year (part-year cost in 2022/23 £11,000).

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Total income has been impacted over recent years by both Brexit and the Covid pandemic with a
          fall in new student enrolments since the post-Covid spike in 2020/21 continuing into 2023/24.
          Despite a very strong start to the 2023/24 recruitment cycle with more offers being made to
          international students than ever before, confirmed acceptances fell away dramatically over the
          late summer period and the annual growth achieved in 2022/23 fell away entirely. National and
          global circumstances have adversely affected international recruitment at all institutions and we
          have been no exception. In particular, the economic and currency situation in specific regions,
          the policy stance taken over the summer by the Government on post study work visas and
          dependents rules, and the extended UKVI processing issues, have all contributed to a sector
          wide drop in conversion. Our application to enrolment conversion rate for international applicants
          has fallen this year from 5-6% to 4%.                                   
          Similarly, sector trends have affected recruitment from the Home market where cost of living
          challenges and low unemployment rates are impacting on the mature postgraduate market in
          particular. Despite an increase in the number of school leavers the HE participation rate in this
          group has fallen for a second year. With Home undergraduate fees remaining fixed once again by
          the UK Government, the reducing real value of income from Home undergraduate students has
          required universities to increasingly look to grow the number of Home postgraduate and
          international students.                                                 
                                                                                  
          Each year, staff costs increase due to the national pay award, incremental drift and promotions.
          Whilst the expected fall in contributions to USS are welcome the fixed unit of resource from
          Home undergraduate students requires student number growth simply to meet the inflationary
          increase in staff costs. Not only do we need to reduce costs quickly to manage the fall in student
          numbers but the challenge of managing rising costs with a fixed annual income is a cycle we
          must break.                                                             
                                                                                  
          To deliver this objective we identified £9.0 million of staff savings during the year with further
          savings to be identified from central professional services during 2023/24. Identifying staff
          savings as soon as practical was critical (albeit very difficult for the University community) as it
          extended the time we now have to focus on the delivery of new academic programmes to deliver
          growth in income. Had we delayed identifying savings and tried to deliver growth first we would
          have been in a difficult financial position given the external impacts on recruitment.
          With income growth now the priority we have created two new committees to identify
          opportunities, develop plans for delivery and oversee performance. The Academic Growth
          Steering Group is Chaired by a new Pro Vice Chancellor for Academic Projects and is
          concentrating on additional programmes, subject areas and modes of delivery at both
          undergraduate and postgraduate level. The Innovation & Commercialisation Board is tasked with
          identifying third stream income projects. Both committees report through to the University
          Executive Board which is tasked with ensuring that our income growth targets are met over the
          coming years.                                                           
                                                                                  
          Although we posted an underlying deficit for the second year running, with a budget deficit also
          forecast for 2023/24, we are confident that we will be able to increase income over the next few
          years whilst also keeping costs down. We do not have any loans so are not pressured by financial
          covenants during a period of recovery. Total cash plus investments fell by £2.7 million but
          remains at a relatively healthy balance of £49.6 million at the year end. The cash reserves
          provide a buffer which will allow us a period of time to turn the deficits around. Although income
          growth is essential for the University to return to a break even position a review of downside
          scenarios (including a no growth scenario) indicates that the University remains a going concern.

          Risk Management                                                         
                                                                                  
          An effective approach to risk management is seen by the University as an essential element of
          corporate governance. We provided a full compliance statement on internal control last year and
          will continue to do so.                                                 
                                                                                  
          The internal auditor confirmed significant assurance with minor improvement opportunities on
          the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Birkbeck’s framework of governance, risk
          management and control in 2021/22. The internal auditor also reviewed risk management
          practices at the School and Department level as part a review of devolved controls and found
          that action was needed to ensure completeness and recording of risk management locally.
          Implementing this recommendation was deferred during the transition to the new academic
          structure and is being taken forward by the new Faculties in 2023/24.   
          The University Risk Management Policy explains the underlying approach to risk management
          and documents the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the Audit Committee,
          University management groups and other key parties. It also outlines key aspects of the risk
          management process and identifies the main reporting procedures. The University has reviewed
          its approach to risk management to strengthen risk ownership and to improve Birkbeck’s ability
          to identify and assess significant risks and respond to them quickly and effectively. It has been
          making regular reports on this to Audit Committee.                      
                                                                                  
          The top-level Risk Register is compiled by senior management and overseen by a Risk
          Management Group comprising the principal risk owners. Each risk owner is responsible for a
          risk register for their risk area in which current and potential future risks are identified and
          evaluated together with the controls in place to mitigate them. Governance and oversight for
          each risk area is provided by the relevant University committee or management group. The risks
          are monitored by Audit Committee and Governors.                         
                                                                                  
          Risks are assessed and scored using gross and net likelihood and impact scores. Gross scores
          indicate the magnitude of the risk without successful controls, and net scores take into account
          the impact of management interventions. Risk scores are divided into low/green (below 9),
          medium/amber (9-12.5) and high/red (12.5+). The maximum risk score which can be achieved
          (highest impact and likelihood) is 25.                                  
          The top risks are reduced student income leading to a position where costs exceed income. The
          financial risk escalated due to lower student numbers in recent years coupled with inflation at an
          historic high level in 2023. The underlying risk factors plus the actions taken and to be taken to
          mitigate the risks have been discussed in this Strategic Review. Although the University is
          forecasting underlying financial deficits for the next few years as it looks to recover student
          numbers we have modelled the impact of not achieving or partially achieving our plans. A
          downside stress test indicates that we will remain solvent but liquidity could become an issue.
          Monthly cash flow reports and management accounts are prepared and reviewed by
          management to help with early identification of emerging risks.         
                                                                                  
          Our Estates and IT teams have developed detailed risk registers for their areas of responsibility
          this year which have been reviewed termly by the Strategic Estates & Infrastructure Committee
          and Digital subcommittee respectively. Monthly e-learning modules covering various aspects of IT
          and data security have been released to staff throughout the year with uptake reported to the
          Strategic Planning Committee. Audit Committee has also overseen other improvements in
          compliance with data protection legislation and in managing IT security risk. Cybersecurity is
          likely to remain a significant risk indefinitely due to the adaptability of those looking to breach
          security arrangements.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Recognising that the organisation change we embarked on during the year was itself a risk. In
          mitigation we increased the range and frequency of project and management oversight groups.
          The Vice-Chancellor chaired fortnightly meetings of the Academic Executive Team, which includes
          the DVC, PVCs, Executive Deans of Schools and key Professional Service Directors and there
          were also frequent meetings of Strategic Planning Committee which is the University’s wider
          executive group. Weekly meetings of the change management project group led by the Deputy
          Vice-Chancellor and supported by a dedicated professional project management team ensure
          appropriate progress was made. The Governors increased the frequency of their meetings to
          ensure effective oversight, and the Chairs of the Governors’ committees met regularly with senior
          management to discuss progress. As a result, the new academic structure was implemented as
          planned on 1 August 2023. A transition group has now been formed to deal with any emerging
          operational matters which may arise.                                    
          Public Benefit Statement                                                
                                                                                  
          The University Charter updated 25 May 2023 states:                      
                                                                                  
          “The objects of Birkbeck shall be to promote for the public benefit and to provide for persons who
          are engaged in earning their livelihood during the daytime and other persons, education,
          instruction and means for research and such facilities as may be deemed appropriate, in
          subjects determined by the Governors, advised by the Academic Board.”   
                                                                                  
          As an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011), we are
          required to demonstrate how our activities are of benefit to the public. The Governing Body has
          regard to the Charity Commission’s guidance on public benefit and meets these requirements in
          the following manner.                                                   
                                                                                  
          The advancement of education                                            
                                                                                  
          The Charities Act 2006 (updated 2011) determines that for education to be a charitable aim for
          the public benefit it “must be capable of being ‘advanced’. This means to promote, sustain and
          increase individual and collective knowledge and understanding of specific areas of study, skills
          and expertise.” It goes on to note that education includes “formal education, training (including
          vocational training) and life-long learning, research and adding to collective knowledge and
          understanding of specific areas of study and expertise [and] the development of individual
          capabilities, competences, skills and understanding”.                   
          The Charter and mission statement align with this charitable purpose which underpins everything
          we do.                                                                  
                                                                                  
          In addition to our contribution to the advancement of education from teaching, our success in
          driving forward research directly contributes to a number of the public benefit criteria outlined in
          the Charities Act. The following table summarises our research income over the last four years:

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Income from research grants and contracts is released in line with progress on the projects. The
          pandemic depressed the amount of research activity that could be undertaken in the latter part
          of 2019/20 and most of 2020/21 leading to a fall in income recognised. Work has now returned
          to normal with a corresponding increase in income. The University currently has a portfolio of live
          research projects representing in excess of £50 million in external grant funding.
                                                                                  
          Whilst our core mission underpins the advancement of education this in turn can have a
          profound impact on wider public benefits.                               
          The Act notes that “in current social and economic circumstances, poverty includes many
          disadvantages and difficulties arising from, or which cause, the lack of financial or material
          resources … [and] can both create, and be created by, adverse social conditions, such as poor
          health and nutrition, and low achievement in education and other areas of human development.”
          It goes on to state that “the [Charity] commission recognises that many charities that are
          concerned with preventing or relieving poverty will do so by addressing both the causes
          (prevention) and the consequences (relief) of poverty.” This section explains how our mission
          contributes to the prevention or relief of poverty through the provision of education. It also
          describes our more widespread support for students with a wide range of characteristics.
                                                                                  
          Birkbeck predominantly delivers teaching in the evening, retaining our historic mission to
          educate working Londoners. We are proud to be a university that opens its doors to people who
          may otherwise not be able to study. We have maintained our commitment to enabling access for
          mature students, whilst also diversifying and increasing the number of younger students, through
          our full-time undergraduate evening degrees. We continue to be a widening access institution
          and a significant voice for the high proportion of our students coming from under-represented
          groups. We introduced a foundation year in 2017/18 to provide non-traditional students without
          strong A level grades a route into our undergraduate programmes with numbers steadily
          increasing to 960 FTE in 2022/23 (see Chart 6). During 2022/23 44% of our students are from
          ethnic minority backgrounds (2021:22: 41%), 42% male (2021/22: 42%), 24% declaring a
          disability (2021/22: 23%) and 64% over the age of 25 (2021/22: 65%). We are proud to offer an
          opportunity to groups of students which may be denied to them elsewhere and remain
          committed to driving this agenda in the higher education sector.        
          Our student body has a high proportion of part-time and mature students. Many of our students
          have non-traditional qualifications and high proportions of students have low income, are from
          ethnic minorities or have a disability. The vast majority of students live and work in London. 97%
          of our part-time students (2021/22: 97%) and 73% of full-time students (2021/22: 75%) are
          over 21. We provide an opportunity for students who wish to combine evening university teaching
          with daytime work and, therefore, offer opportunities for students who otherwise would not be
          able to study. Over recent years we have seen a steady increase in the number of full time
          undergraduates aged 21 or under choosing to study at Birkbeck suggesting the ability to mix
          education and work is increasingly attractive to younger students.      
                                                                                  
          In recent years, higher tuition fees, the absence of maintenance loans, and debt aversion have
          resulted in lower recruitment onto our part-time programmes. We are pleased to see that
          government policy is re-focussing on lifelong learning and increasing the range of study modes
          for mature students, including part-time study. Despite the challenges faced by the part-time
          sector our outcomes regarding access to higher education continue to be strong and
          demonstrate an institution-wide commitment to working with non-traditional students. We plan to
          continue with our current approach on access.

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STRATEGIC REVIEW (continued)                                            
                                                                                  
          Many of our students work during the day and have families. These critical life factors inevitably
          challenge our students and this is reflected in our continuation rates. Through the pandemic, the
          move to on-line was welcomed as it enabled our students to study when time allowed. Since the
          pandemic, hybrid working has become the norm for many workers who no longer need to travel
          to the capital five days a week. To ensure that working students with other life priorities can

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)      
                                                                                  
          Nominations Committee                                                   
                                                                                  
          The Nominations Committee considers nominations for independent governor vacancies and the
          membership of the Governors’ committees. Recommendations to the Governors take into
          account the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of members and are based on
          assessment against objective criteria. Nominations Committee also considers issues of
          succession planning and diversity within the Governing Body and confirms the appointment of
          the Chair and Deputy Chair of Governors annually. This year Nominations Committee also
          considered and recommended to Governors a proposal to establish a Selection Committee for
          the new Vice-Chancellor                                                 
          Strategic Estates and Infrastructure Committee                          
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Estates and Infrastructure Committee (SEIC) is responsible for overseeing and
          advising Governors on the development and ongoing review of the University’s estates and
          infrastructure strategy in the context of the University’s overall plan and strategic objectives. It
          advises Governors, in conjunction with F&GPC, on the University’s property portfolio and the
          acquisition and disposal of property and leases; and on proposals for, and subsequent
          monitoring of, major University-level estates, infrastructure and equipment projects. SEIC reports
          to Governors, but for business with budget or financial strategy implications, it does so via
          F&GPC.                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Digital Sub-Committee                                                   
                                                                                  
          The Digital Sub-Committee has been set up to oversee digital strategy, IT infrastructure and key
          IT risks. It is chaired by an independent Governor and its membership comprises independent
          governors, academic governors, an external co-opted adviser, plus a nominee from the Students
          Union. The Committee reports to SEIC on the University’s IT infrastructure and equipment
          projects.                                                               
                                                                                  
          Remuneration Committee                                                  
                                                                                  
          Remuneration Committee develops and has oversight of an overall framework to cover the
          remuneration, benefits and conditions of employment of the staff of the University. It considers
          the remuneration, benefits and conditions of employment of the University’s senior team and the
          remuneration, benefits and conditions of employment of other members of staff with senior
          management roles on salaries of more than £100,000 (full time equivalent), making an annual
          report to the Governors. The Committee’s terms of reference are compliant with the CUC’s
          Remuneration Code. The Committee’s membership is wholly independent and does not include
          any University staff.                                                   
          Strategic Planning Committee                                            
                                                                                  
          The Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor and consists of
          University officers with strategic management responsibility. Its remit is to act as the University’s
          Executive Committee responsible for its effective and successful operation. SPC has considered
          University-wide strategic issues and priorities and advised Governors accordingly. It has been
          responsible for internal planning and resource allocation, policy and procedures. It oversees the
          annual planning and budgeting process, giving feedback to Schools and Professional Services on
          developing plans and co-ordinates and integrates budget plans for presentation to Finance and
          General Purposes Committee.

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)      
                                                                                  
          As part of the academic restructure in 2022/23 and subsequent changes to the governance and
          committee structure, it was agreed that a University Executive Board (UEB) would replace SPC as
          Birkbeck’s principal executive group, with groups reporting to it on student recruitment,
          international strategy, HR, and ethics, from 1 August 2023.             
                                                                                  
          Academic Board and Academic Board Executive Committee                   
                                                                                  
          Under the University Statutes Governors have oversight and responsibility for all the University’s
          activities, but must consider the advice of the Academic Board on all academic matters.
          Academic Board is responsible to the Governing Body for the academic work of the University and
          reports termly on the business it has considered. The Academic Board is chaired by the Vice-
          Chancellor and has a membership of more than 200 drawn from academic and library staff and
          the students of the University. To increase the effectiveness of its decision making, it has
          established the Academic Board Executive Committee (ABExCo) as its steering committee.
          ABExCo is also chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, whose members include the Deputy and Pro Vice-
          Chancellors, the Executive Deans of the academic Schools (now Faculties) and the academic
          staff and student Governors, all of whom are also members of the full Academic Board.
          The membership of the above committees during the year is shown on pages 4-7.
                                                                                  
          Statement of internal control                                           
                                                                                  
          The governing body is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control that
          supports the achievement of Birkbeck’s strategies, policies, aims and objectives whilst
          safeguarding the public and external funds for which we are responsible, in accordance with the
          responsibilities assigned to the governing body in the University Charter and Statutes and the
          public interest governance principles set out in the regulatory framework for Higher Education in
          England.                                                                
                                                                                  
          The system of internal control includes arrangements for the prevention and detection of
          corruption, fraud, bribery and other irregularities. It is designed to manage rather than eliminate
          the risk of failure to fulfil strategies, policies, aims and objectives and safeguard public funds,
          and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness.
                                                                                  
          The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify the principal
          risks, evaluate the nature and extent of those risks and manage them efficiently, effectively and
          economically. The process is regularly reviewed by Governors and accords with the principles in
          the Committee of University Chairs’ HE Code of Governance.              
          Birkbeck manages risks through a Risk Register, reviewed by the Strategic Planning Committee
          (and UEB from 1 August 2023), and the Audit Committee reporting to Governors. The University’s
          Risk Management Policy is reviewed annually by the Risk Management Group and Audit
          Committee reporting to Governors.                                       
                                                                                  
          The following processes have been established:                          
                                                                                  
            •  the performance and strategic direction of Birkbeck is reviewed by the Strategic Planning
               Committee (UEB from 1 August 2023) and the Governors at each meeting;
                                                                                  
            •  Governors agree and annually review Key Performance Indicators linked to strategic
               objectives and risks;

               internal control and risk management;                              
                                                                                  
            •  Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Internal Auditor, which include an
               independent opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of Birkbeck’s system of internal
               control, together with recommendations for improvement. Audit Committee may also
               request additional reports to gain assurance from other parties on areas of concern;
                                                                                  
            •  a risk prioritisation methodology based on assessment of likelihood and impact has been
               established. The Risk Register covers corporate level risks, including ability to fulfil
               Birkbeck’s aims and objectives and ability to continue to comply with its conditions of
               registration with the Office for Students;                         
            •  Audit Committee receives regular reports from University management on action taken to

               including new risks;                                               
            •  Ethics Committee provides assurance on ethical matters related to research activities;
                                                                                  
            •  there are comprehensive Financial Regulations, detailing financial controls and
               procedures, approved by Governors on the advice of the Audit Committee and F&GPC;
                                                                                  
            •  the governing body has reviewed Birkbeck’s governance system against the CUC’s HE
               Code of Governance and concluded that the University is compliant with the principles of
               the Code. The Governing Body has asked Audit Committee to keep under review
               Birkbeck's processes and practices in line with the provisions of the Code;

            •  the diversity of the governing body has increased following the appointment of new
               independent governors through an open call for expressions of interest. The Review of
               Governance Effectiveness asked Governors to consider the definition and meaning of
               Equality, Diversity and Inclusion for Birkbeck. An Equality Diversity and Inclusion
               Committee with a refreshed remit has been set up with the UEB as its parent committee;
               and

Birkbeck, University of London                                          
          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)      
                                                                                  
          Governors have appointed a professional independent Internal Audit Service whose annual
          programme is approved by the Audit Committee. The internal audit function provides, by
          undertaking review, independent objective assurance to the governing body, through the Audit
          Committee, on the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the design and
          effectiveness of the operation of internal controls that are intended to control critical business
          application risks. Internal audit also helps the University accomplish its objectives by bringing a
          systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk
          management, control and governance processes and, by working with management, adding
          value through advice and guidance.                                      
          The internal audit work programme is risk-focused and the plan remains dynamic, being updated
          regularly to reflect changes in the University’s risk profile. Internal audit monitors the progress
          made by operational units in implementing recommendations to ensure that they are addressed
          in a timely and effective manner, and reports progress regularly to the Audit Committee.
                                                                                  
          Governors have appointed a professional external audit service to assess and report on whether:
                                                                                  
            •  the financial statements of the University give a true and fair picture of the state of its
               affairs and of its income and expenditure, gains and losses and cashflow for the financial
               year;                                                              
            •  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting
               standards including the Office for Students’ Accounts Direction;   
            •  external grants and income for specific purposes have been properly applied to those
               purposes and managed appropriately; and                            
            •  income has been applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions from both the
               Office for Students and Research England.

          Opinion on the financial statements                                     
                                                                                  
          In our opinion, the financial statements:

            •  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
               Accounting Practice.                                               
                                                                                  
          We have audited the financial statements of Birkbeck, University of London (“the University”) for

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,     
          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)                                        
                                                                                  
          Basis for opinion                                                       
                                                                                  
          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs
          (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We
          believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
          for our opinion.                                                        
                                                                                  
          Independence                                                            
          We are independent of the University in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
          relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
          and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
                                                                                  
          Conclusions relating to going concern                                   
                                                                                  
          In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Board of Governors’ use of the
          going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
                                                                                  
          Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating
          to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the
          University’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from
          when the financial statements are authorised for issue.                 
                                                                                  
          Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Board of Governors with respect to going
          concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.          
                                                                                  
          Other information                                                       
                                                                                  
          The Board of Governors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
          the information included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements, other than the financial
          statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
          cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
          Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
          information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
          the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
          inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there
          is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other
          information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
          misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
                                                                                  
          We have nothing to report in this regard.

          satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Board of
          Governors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
          from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.              
                                                                                  
          In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Governors are responsible for assessing the
          University’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
          going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Governors either
          intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do
          so.                                                                     
                                                                                  
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements    
                                                                                  
          Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
          whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
          auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
          is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
          material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
          considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
          influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
          Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
                                                                                  
          Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
          design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
          misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are
          capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

          Based on:                                                               
                                                                                  
            •  our understanding of the University and the sector in which it operates;
            •  discussion with management and those charged with governance, including the Audit
               Committee;                                                         
            •  obtaining and understanding of the University’s policies and procedures regarding
               compliance with laws and regulations;                              
            •  direct representation from the Accountable Officer; and            
            •  our risk assessment                                                
                                                                                  
          we considered the significant laws and regulations to be the Financial Reporting Standard 102,
          the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further Education and Higher
          Education (FEHE SORP 2019), the OfS’ Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) and UK tax legislation.
                                                                                  
          The University is also subject to laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance
          could have a material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, for
          example through the imposition of fines or litigations. We identified such laws and regulations to
          be registration with the Office for Students and their ongoing conditions of registration.
          Our procedures in respect of the above included:                        
                                                                                  
            •  review of minutes of meetings of those charged with governance for any instances of
               non-compliance with laws and regulations;                          
            •  review of correspondence with regulatory and tax authorities for any instances of non-
               compliance with laws and regulations;                              
            •  review of financial statement disclosures and agreeing to supporting documentation; and
            •  review of legal expenditure accounts to understand the nature of expenditure incurred.
                                                                                  
          Fraud                                                                   
                                                                                  
          We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including
          fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:                         
                                                                                  
            •  enquiry with management and those charged with governance, the Audit Committee and
               internal audit regarding any known or suspected instances of fraud;
            •  obtaining an understanding of the University’s policies and procedures relating to:
                    Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and           
                 o                                                                
                    Internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud.
                 o                                                                
            •  review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any known or
               suspected instances of fraud;                                      
            •  discussion amongst the engagement team as to how and where fraud might occur in the
               financial statements;                                              
            •  performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that
               may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;

          Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                    
                                                                                  
          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF BIRKBECK,     
          UNIVERSITY OF LONDON (continued)                                        
                                                                                  
          Based on our risk assessment, we considered the areas most susceptible to fraud to be posting
          inappropriate journals to manipulate financial results and management bias in accounting
          estimates.                                                              
                                                                                  
          Our procedures in respect of the above included:                        
            •  Testing a sample of journal entries throughout the year, which met a defined risk criteria,
               by agreeing to supporting documentation;                           
            •  Assessing significant estimates made by management for bias, including going concern
               assumptions; assumptions applied in calculation of pension scheme liabilities; bad debt
               provision; impairment of tangible and intangible assets; useful economic lives of tangible
               fixed assets.                                                      
                                                                                  
          We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all
          engagement team members and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance
          with laws and regulations throughout the audit.                         
          Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial
          statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is
          higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate
          concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are
          inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance
          with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
          statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.               
                                                                                  
          A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on
          the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
          description forms part of our auditor’s report.                         
                                                                                  
          Use of our report                                                       
                                                                                  
          This report is made solely to the Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Section 75 of
          the Higher Education Research Act 2017 and the charters and statutes of the University. Our
          audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the University’s Board of Governors
          those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
          than the University and the Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
          the opinions we have formed.

           1.   Basis of preparation                                                
                                                                                    
                These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
                Practice (SORP): Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 and in accordance with Financial
                Reporting Standard (FRS) 102: The financial reporting standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
                Ireland. The University is a public benefit entity and, therefore, has applied the relevant public benefit
                requirement of FRS 102. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost
                convention (modified by the revaluation of fixed assets and derivative financial instruments).
                The University's activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development, performance and
                position are set out in the Financial Sustainability section of the Strategic Review.
                Going Concern                                                       
                The impact of lower student income following Brexit, increased competition across London and external
                factors impacting international recruitment, together with historic high rates of inflation, have significantly
                impacted our financial position. Annual increases in staff costs (due to promotions, inflationary increases
                and increment advancement) exceed the inflationary increase in our main source of income, primarily due
                to the fee cap set by the government on undergraduate tuition fees. Not only have we seen surpluses of
                5% of income eroded but we now need to implement a recovery plan to move from a period of actual and
                forecast deficits back into a sustainable financial position.       
                In November 2021, the University endorsed a new five-year strategy covering 2021-26. The strategy is
                focussed on the difficult challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as well as the lessons learnt and
                strides taken forward in responding to it. The analysis underpinning the strategy points to fundamental
                challenges for the University. In particular, financial sustainability, the ability to maintain research
                intensity, market position and teaching competitiveness. Repositioning will involve a fundamental revision
                of our underlying operational and teaching delivery models, creating the greater degree of standardisation
                in mode of teaching delivery which is necessary to create clarity and flexibility in our student offer and
                support student success. Addressing competitiveness will also involve the major efficiency gains that are
                necessary to return Birkbeck to financial sustainability.           
                With a significant decline in recruitment in 2021/22 followed by flat recruitment in 2022/23 and lower
                recruitment once again in 2023/24, Birkbeck now faces immediate challenges which confirm the
                importance of this strategic change but which makes its rapid realisation also essential. In terms of the
                immediate financial challenges linked to student recruitment we have been working closely with
                Governors to confirm the immediate steps in our recovery plan and during 2022/23 Governors agreed the
                following key actions:                                              
              - a reduction in staff costs of £12 million over two years to bring costs back into alignment with reduced
                tuition income;                                                     
              - increased income totalling £15 million by 2026/27, primarily from new programmes, new modes of
                delivery (including HyFlex), rationalisation and simplification of existing portfolio to make programmes
                more attractive, plus some additional third-stream income; and      
              - a reduction in the size of our estate. Having purchased the building adjacent to our main campus site as
                part of our strategy to provide improved learning and teaching facilities for our staff and students, we are
                in a position to dispose of estate assets that are less suited to our future needs.
                Significant progress was made during the year such that we delivered £9 million of staff savings for the
                start of 2023/24 - £1m ahead of the phased target. In addition, around £3 million of savings were
                achieved early during 2022/23 helping us to deliver a much improved financial position (albeit still an
                underlying deficit of £2.2 million) against budget. Reducing our staff costs quickly has provided sufficient
                financial headroom to allow us to now focus on delivering income recovery plans over the next few years.

Birkbeck, University of London                                           
           Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                     
                                                                                    
           Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                             
                                                                                    
           for the year ended 31 July 2023                                          
                                                                                    
           1.   Basis of preparation                                                
                                                                                    
                Going Concern (continued)                                           
                                                                                    
                Financial modelling has been undertaken based on varying assumptions of tuition income and efficiency
                savings, including stress testing. Although the base-case scenario predicts underlying deficits for the next
                few years as we build new programmes and deliver education via new modes of delivery the forecasts
                indicate that cash reserves will be maintained. Even under a downside scenario where no income
                recovery is possible we remain solvent and have sufficient time to undertake further mitigating actions.
                Governors have reviewed the financial forecasts, the assumptions which underpin them, our short and
                medium term recovery strategy and the risks we face. They have concluded that despite the challenges
                resulting from the drop in student numbers there is a reasonable expectation that the University has
                adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, we continue
                to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.
           2.   Basis of consolidation                                              
                The financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of the Students' Union as the
                University does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions.
                                                                                    
           3.   Income recognition                                                  
                Tuition fee income is stated gross of any expenditure which is not a discount and credited to the
                Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure over the period in which students are studying.
                Where the amount of the tuition fee is reduced by a discount for prompt payment income receivable is
                shown net of the discount. Bursaries and scholarships are accounted for as expenditure and not
                deducted from income.                                               
                Income from the sale of goods or services is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when
                the goods or services are supplied to the external customers or the terms of the contract has been
                satisfied.                                                          
                Investment income is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a receivable basis.
                Grant funding                                                       
                Government revenue grants, including OfS teaching and UKRI research and research grants, are
                recognised as income over the periods in which the University recognises the related costs for which the
                grant is intended to compensate. Where part of a government grant is deferred it is recognised as
                deferred income within creditors and allocated between creditors due within one year and due after more
                than one year as appropriate.                                       
                Grants, including research grants, from non-government sources, are recognised as income when the
                University is entitled to the income and performance related conditions have been met. Income received
                in advance of performance related conditions being met is recognised as deferred income within creditors
                and released to income as the conditions are met.                   
                Donations and endowments                                            
                                                                                    
                Non-exchange transactions without performance related conditions are treated as donations and
                endowments. Donations and endowments with donor imposed restrictions are recognised in income
                when the University is entitled to the funds. Income is retained within restricted reserves until it is utilised
                in line with such restrictions at which point the income is released to general reserves.

           Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                     
                                                                                    
           Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                             
                                                                                    
           for the year ended 31 July 2023                                          
                                                                                    
           3.   Income recognition (continued)                                      
                                                                                    
                Donations and endowments (continued)                                
                Donations with no restrictions are recognised as income when the University is entitled to the funds.
                Investment income from endowments and appreciation of endowment funds are recorded as income
                during the year in which the growth arises and as either restricted or unrestricted income according to the
                terms applied to the individual endowment fund.                     
                There are three main types of donations and endowments identified within reserves:
             a) restricted donations - the donor has specified that the donation must be used for a particular objective;
             b) unrestricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested
                to generate an income stream for the general benefit of the University; and
             c) restricted permanent endowments - the donor has specified that the fund is to be permanently invested to
                generate an income stream to be applied to a particular objective.  
                Capital grants                                                      
                Government capital grants are recognised as income over the expected useful life of the asset the funds
                were used to purchase/construct. Other capital grants are recognised as income when the University has
                satisfied any performance related conditions associated with the grant.
                                                                                    
           4.   Accounting for retirement benefits                                  
                University staff are members of two principal pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme
                (USS) and the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). The schemes are
                primarily defined benefit schemes which are externally managed. Each fund is valued every three years by
                professionally qualified independent actuaries.                     
                Both schemes are multi-employer schemes for which it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities
                of the University due to the mutual nature of the schemes. The schemes are accounted for as a defined
                contribution retirement benefit schemes.                            
                A liability is recorded within provisions for any contractual commitment to fund past deficits within the
                schemes.                                                            
                                                                                    
                Defined contribution plan                                           
                A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the University pays fixed
                contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
                amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
                expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
                Defined benefit plan                                                
                                                                                    
                Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under
                defined benefit plans, the university’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
                employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that
                returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
                the university. The university should recognise a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net
                of plan assets. This net defined benefit liability is measured as the estimated amount of benefit that
                employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to
                determine its present value, less the fair value (at bid price) of plan assets. The calculation is performed
                by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Where the calculation results in a net asset,
                recognition of the asset is limited to the extent to which the university is able to recover the surplus either
                through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.

Birkbeck, University of London                                           
           Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                     
                                                                                    
           Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                             
                                                                                    
           for the year ended 31 July 2023                                          
                                                                                    
           5.   Employment benefits                                                 
                Short term employment benefits such as salaries and compensated absences are recognised as an
                expense in the year in which the employees render service to the University. Any unused benefits are
                accrued and measured as the additional amount the University expects to pay as a result of the unused
                entitlement.                                                        
           6.   Finance leases                                                      
                Leases in which the University assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
                asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease and the
                corresponding lease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value
                and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
                Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
                outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce
                a constant periodic rate of interest of the remaining balance of the liability.
           7.   Service concession arrangements                                     
                Fixed assets held under service concession arrangements are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the
                present value of the minimum lease payments when the assets are bought into use with a corresponding
                financial liability.                                                
                Payments under the service concession arrangement are allocated between service costs, finance
                charges and financial liability repayments to reduce the financial liability to nil over the life of the
                arrangement.                                                        
                                                                                    
           8.   Operating leases                                                    
                Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any lease
                premiums or incentives are spread over the minimum lease term.      
           9.   Foreign currency                                                    
                Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the
                transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
                are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
                exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for
                the year.                                                           
                                                                                    
           10.  Fixed assets                                                        
                Fixed assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
                losses. Certain items of fixed assets that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to the date of
                transition to the 2015 HE SORP, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount
                at the date of that revaluation.                                    
                Where parts of a fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed
                assets.                                                             
                Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a building are
                capitalised.                                                        
                Land and buildings                                                  
                Land and buildings are stated at cost (deemed cost). Costs incurred in relation to land and buildings after
                initial purchase or construction are capitalised to the extent that they increase the expected future
                benefits to the University. Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful
                life. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight line.

Birkbeck, University of London                                           
           Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                     
                                                                                    
           Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                             
                                                                                    
           for the year ended 31 July 2023                                          
                                                                                    
           10.  Fixed assets (continued)                                            
                                                                                    
                The useful lives of land and buildings are assessed on a building by building basis and the cost is
                depreciated as follows:                                             
                Buildings: 40 to 100 years                                          
                Refurbishments: 5 to 20 years                                       
                Plant and machinery: 10 to 30 years                                 
                Leasehold land: the life of the lease                               
                Assets in the course of construction: no depreciation is charged until the asset is brought into use
                                                                                    
                Equipment                                                           
                Equipment costing less than £10,000 per individual item is recognised as expenditure. All other
                equipment is capitalised.                                           
                Capitalised equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over its expected useful life. Indicative useful
                lives are as follows:                                               
                - Computer hardware: 3 years                                        
                - Equipment acquired for specific research projects is depreciated over the life of the project
                - Other equipment: 3 to 5 years                                     
                                                                                    
                Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the date of preparation of each
                Balance Sheet.                                                      
           11.  Heritage assets                                                     
                Works of art and other valuable artefacts are capitalised and recognised at the cost or value of the
                acquisition where such a cost or valuation is reasonably obtainable. They are subsequently held at
                carrying value. Heritage assets are not depreciated as their long economic life means that any
                depreciation would not be material.                                 
                The most recent professional valuation of heritage assets was carried out in June 2022. The impairment
                has been recognised in these financial accounts. See note 12 for further information.
                                                                                    
           12.  Intangible assets                                                   
                Intangible assets are amortised over the remaining estimated economic life of the assets. Large value
                software implementations are treated as intangible assets with amortisation commencing once the initial
                phase of development is complete. The rate of amortisation for the current software intangible asset is 8
                years.                                                              
                Programme development expenditure in collaboration with the University of London is charged to the
                Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for
                capitalisation as set out in FRS 102: 18.4 and 18.8H. When the recognition criteria have been met then
                such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset under construction. When the asset becomes
                available for use the useful life is estimated and the asset is amortised on a straight line basis over the
                useful life. The useful economic life of jointly funded course development is 3 years.
           13.  Investments                                                         
                Non-current asset investments are held on the Balance Sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
                Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the University's accounts. Current asset
                investments are held at fair value with movements recognised within total comprehensive income for the
                year.

           Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023                     
                                                                                    
           Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)                             
                                                                                    
           for the year ended 31 July 2023                                          
                                                                                    
           14.  Cash and cash equivalents                                           
                Cash includes cash in hand, short term deposits which have a maturity date of less than three months
                from placement and overdrafts.                                      
                                                                                    
           15.  Provisions                                                          
                Provisions are recognised in the financial statements when:         
              a) the University has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
              b) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
              c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.   
                The amount recognised as a provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
                pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.         
                                                                                    
           16.  Taxation                                                            
                The University is an exempt charity within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. It is, therefore,
                a charity within the meaning of Para 1 of Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and accordingly, the
                University is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within
                categories covered by section 478-488 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or section 256 of the
                Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied to exclusively
                charitable purposes.                                                
                The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
                included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to fixed assets is included in their
                cost.                                                               
           17.  Reserves                                                            
                Reserves are classified as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted endowment reserves include balances
                which, through endowment to the University, are held as a permanently restricted fund which the
                university must hold in perpetuity.                                 
                Other restricted reserves include balances where the donor has designated a specific purpose and,
                therefore, the University is restricted in the use of these funds.  
                                                                                    
           18.  Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
                Management considers that certain accounting estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, debtors,
                fixed assets and provisions are its critical accounting estimates.  
                In preparing these financial statements the University has made the following judgements:
              a) Pension provisions include key assumptions on discount rates, salary inflation and staff numbers in the
                future. As the Institution is contractually bound to make deficit recovery payments to USS, this is
                recognised as a liability on the balance sheet. The provision is based on the USS deficit recovery plan
                agreed in the 2020 actuarial valuation, which defines the deficit payment required as a percentage of
                future salaries between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 3034. The contributions will be reassessed within each
                triennial valuation of the scheme. The provision is based on management's estimate of expected future
                salary inflations, changes in staff numbers and the prevailing rate of discount. Further details are set out
                in note 26.                                                         
              b) The holiday pay provision is calculated using a sample of departments within the university.
              c) A general provision for bad and doubtful debts is calculated using a formula based on the age of the
                overdue debt. The formula is applied consistently each year but necessarily requires a degree of
                estimation. A specific provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for individual debts where recovery is

              The Vice Chancellor’s remuneration has been set and reviewed by a remuneration panel comprised of
              independent Governors. The panel includes the Chair of Governors, but in accordance with good practice, is
              chaired by another independent Governor. The Vice Chancellor is not a member of this panel and does not
              attend or participate in its meetings or business. The panel is supported by the College Secretary & Clerk to
              the Governors and, additionally, advice is provided, or commissioned, by the Director of Human Resources.

              The panel reviews the remuneration of the Vice Chancellor annually in the light of the following
              information:                                                          
              • Sector remuneration benchmarking information provided by the CUC and other sources for a range of
                relevant comparator institutions.                                   
              • Retention and continuity of senior leadership through a period of profound challenge and transformation
                for the University has been a priority, thus additional institutions have been added to the benchmarking
                profile to support objective consideration of retention issues.     
              • The outcome of the Vice Chancellor’s annual appraisal conducted by the Chair of Governors. This is a
                formal documented process in which annual objectives are set and performance against those objectives
                are reviewed.                                                       
              • The broader context provided by institutional performance information and institutional KPIs agreed by
                Governors.

              The Vice Chancellor last received an increase in base salary, over and above the level of the national pay
              award, in 2012. He last received a bonus payment in 2016/17. As confirmed last year, the Vice Chancellor’s
              salary will not be subject to any increase in relation to the national pay award. The Vice Chancellor’s historic
              salary reflects his contribution to the leadership and development of the University over a 20 year period
              which has had transformational impact over this time. In 2022, in view of Birkbeck’s financial position, the
              Vice Chancellor requested that his salary be reduced by £50,000 per annum until further notice. The
              Remuneration Committee agreed to this reduction. This reduction came into effect on 1 December 2022.

            9a   Access and Participation (continued)                               
                                                                                    
              The University records and reports on its access and participation plan according to the requirements of the
              Office for Students, divided into the following areas:                
               - access work to help students from under-represented groups to go into higher education;
               - financial support for eligible students;                           
               - work to support disabled students in their study; and              
                                                                                    
                 research into and evaluation of our activities.                    
              The University’s revised Access and Participation Plan for 2022-25 was approved early in the academic year
              and this plan outlines both the priorities and the proposed activity to achieve these priorities. The University’s
              strategic activity included progress in developing and delivering a project to improve how will be able to
              monitor student engagement and thus support our students in their learning. We established an
              implementation plan to address the awarding gap in the performance between our Black and White students.
              Finally, we completed the portfolio review commenced in 2021-22, restructuring the teaching model to
              simplify and standardise the approach so students will be taught across three terms, in manageable module
              sizes with regular feedback. The new programmes will commence in autumn 2023.
              The Access and Engagement Team continued to deliver programmes to support young people in further
              education, mature learner engagement and embarked on work to start delivering new objectives in the
              Access and Participation Plan from 2023-24 and its spend was on target within the year.
              The University purposefully reduced its overall expenditure on individual student bursaries as agreed with the
              OfS, recognising that investment in institutional approaches, such as the student engagement programme
              would provide benefit to a greater number of students. Investment to support disabled students, including
              learning support, increased (with additional investment in mental health services and study support)
              significantly this year. Research and evaluation investment remained as planned (marginally under target
              owing to staff changes), with further support (and a dedicated staff role) secured for 2023-24 onwards.

              The fixed assets for the university can be further analysed as follows:
              Within land & buildings are freehold buildings with a net book value at 31 July 2023 of £24,009,000.
              (31 July 2022: £24,403,000). The remaining assets within land and buildings are held on a leasehold basis.
                                                                                    
              Shortly after the year-end it was decided that the project to refurbish the auditorium within Birkbeck Central
              would not be progressed. Costs incurred to date have been transferred from assets in construction to
              the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

              The University holds a number of assets of historical or artistic interest. The assets were donated to the
              University over a number of years with nil cost. They were last valued by Bonham and Sons Ltd in June
              2022.                                                                 
                                                                                    
              There was one addition during the year, a donation from Patsy Hickman to the School of Arts. No
              heritage assets were disposed of during the year.

              The obligation to fund the past deficit on the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) arises from the
              contractual obligation with the USS to fund deficit payments in accordance with the deficit recovery plan. In
              calculating this provision, management have estimated future staff levels within the USS scheme for the
              duration of the contractual obligation and salary inflation.          
              The USS 2020 valuation was signed with an effective date of 1 October 2021. The recommended deed on
              benefit changes was executed by 28 February 2022.                     
              Key assumptions and further information is provided in note 25. See also note 7 in respect of significant one-
              off pension costs. More details on the 2020 actuarial valuation are set out in note 25.
                                                                                    
              Other provisions                                                      
              During the year, the University undertook further restructuring under a voluntary severance scheme. A
              provision has been recognised for amounts agreed before the year-end that are due to be paid after the year-
              end.

              All Governors and senior staff of the university are required to complete an annual statement detailing any
              significant personal links they have with other organisations. Due to the nature of our business and the
              composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from a range of private and public sector organisations)
              it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a Governor or senior member of
              staff may have an interest. All transactions involving related parties are conducted in accordance with the
              university's financial regulations and procurement policies/procedures.
              During the year, the University entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related
              parties. Transactions entered into, and balances outstanding at 31 July 2023 are as follows:

              The consolidated financial statements do not include the income and expenditure of Birkbeck Students'
              Union as the university does not exert control or dominant influence over policy decisions. A grant of
              £365,000 (2021/22: £340,000) was provided to the Union.               
              In 2018/19 a loan of £175,000 was issued to the Birkbeck Students' Union. The loan was issued to support
              their return to a position of financial sustainability. The loan is repayable over seven years and no interest is
              charged. The loan outstanding as at 31 July 2023 was £60,000.         
              At the year-end, there was a balance due to the Students' Union of £19,000 (2021/22: £50,000). As at 31
              July 2023 there was no balance due from the Students' Union (2021/22: Nil).

              Different categories of staff were eligible to join one of two pension schemes:
              • Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS); and                      
              • The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL). 
              Both schemes are defined benefit schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered
              funds.

              (i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)                     
                                                                                    
              The University participates in Universities Superannuation Scheme. The scheme is a hybrid pension scheme,
              providing defined benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the
              scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the
              assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The institution
              is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and is unable to identify
              its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. As
              required by Section 28 of FRS 102 “Employee benefits”, the institution therefore accounts for the scheme as
              if it were a wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account
              represents the contributions payable to the scheme. Since the institution has entered into an agreement (the
              Recovery Plan) that determines how each employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit, the
              institution recognises a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that
              they relate to the deficit) with the related expenses being recognised through the profit and loss account.
              FRS 102 makes the distinction between a group plan and a multi-employer scheme. A group plan consists of
              a collection of entities under common control typically with a sponsoring employer. A multi-employer scheme
              is a scheme for entities not under common control and represents (typically) an industry-wide scheme such
              as Universities Superannuation Scheme. The accounting for a multi-employer scheme where the employer
              has entered into an agreement with the scheme that determines how the employer will fund a deficit results
              in the recognition of a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that
              they relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with section 28 of FRS 102.
              University Governors are satisfied that the Universities Superannuation Scheme meets the definition of a
              multi-employer scheme and has therefore recognised the discounted fair value of the contractual
              contributions under the recovery plan in existence at the date of approving the financial statements.
              The latest available complete actuarial valuation of the Retirement Income Builder is at 31 March 2020 (the
              valuation date), which was carried out using the projected unit method.
                                                                                    
              Since the institution cannot identify its share of USS Retirement Income Builder assets and liabilities, the
              following disclosures reflect those relevant for those assets and liabilities as a whole.

           Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2023

           for the year ended 31 July 2023                                          
                                                                                    
           25 Pension schemes (continued)                                           
                                                                                    
              (i) The Universities' Superannuation Scheme (USS)                     
                                                                                    
              The 2020 valuation was the sixth valuation for USS prepared under the scheme-specific funding regime
              introduced by the Pensions Act 2004. The Act requires schemes to adopt a statutory funding objective to have
              sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions. At the valuation date, the value of the
              assets of the scheme was £66.5 billion and the value of the scheme's technical provisions was £80.6 billion
              indicating a shortfall of £14.1 billion and a funding ratio of 83%.   
              In accordance with the requirements of the SORP, the university currently recognises a provision for its
              obligation to fund past deficits arising within the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).
              The key financial assumptions used in the 2020 valuation are described below. More detail is set out in the
              Statement of Funding Principles (https://www.uss.co.uk/about-us/valuation-and-funding/statement-of-
              funding-principles).

                                           long-term difference of 0.1% p.a. from 2040
              Pension increase (subject to a floor of 0%) CPI assumption plus 0.05%.

              The main demographic assumption used relates to the mortality assumptions. These assumptions are based
              on analysis of the scheme's experience carried out as part of the 2020 actuarial valuation. The mortality
              assumptions used in these figures are as follows:

              The liability figures have been produced using the following assumptions.

              In accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 and the SORP, the University has made a provision for this
              contractual commitment to fund the past deficit.                      
              A new deficit recovery plan was put in place as part of the 2020 valuation which requires payment of 6.2% of
              salaries over the period 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2024, at which point the rate will increase to 6.3%. The
              2022 deficit recovery liability reflects this plan.                   
              The latest triennial valuation was undertaken as at 31 March 2023 and determined that movements in
              valuation assumptions had improved the position significantly such that the scheme deficit of £14.1 billion
              assessed at 31 March 2020 had changed to a surplus of £7.4 billion at 31 March 2023. Although unlikely to
              be formally approved before the date of signing these Financial Statements it is likely that contribution rates
              will fall significantly whilst benefits will also be restored to those in place prior to the 2020 valuation. Our
              share of the scheme liability will be reversed in 2023/24 once the 2023 USS valuation has been formally
              approved.

              General description of the Pension Scheme                             
                                                                                    
              Birkbeck participates in the Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London ("SAUL"), which is a
              centralised defined benefit scheme within the United Kingdom and was contracted out of the Second State
              Pension (prior to April 2016).                                        
              SAUL is an independently-managed pension scheme for the non-academic staff of over 50 colleges and
              institutions with links to higher education.                          
              Pension benefits accrued within SAUL currently build up on a Career Average Revalued Earnings ("CARE")
              basis.                                                                
              On 1 April SAUL introduced SAUL Start, a defined contribution scheme. Individuals joining SAUL from 1 April
              2023 are automatically enrolled into SAUL Start for the first three years of membership. After three years of
              membership members are automatically transferred to SAUL Care however members can opt to remain in
              SAUL Start. SAUL Start is managed by Legal & General.

           25 Pension schemes (continued)                                           
                                                                                    
              (ii) The Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL) continued
                                                                                    
              Birkbeck is not expected to be liable to SAUL for any other current or participating employer's obligations
              under the Rules of SAUL, but in the event of an insolvency of any participating employer within SAUL, an
              amount of any pension shortfall (which cannot otherwise be recovered) in respect of that employer, may be
              spread across the remaining participating employers and reflected in the next actuarial valuation.
                                                                                    
              Funding Policy                                                        
              SAUL's statutory funding objective is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to meet the costs incurred by
              the Trustee in paying SAUL's benefits as they fall due (the "Technical Provisions"). The Trustee adopts
              assumptions which, taken as a whole, are intended to be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits
              already in payment to continue to be paid and for the commitments which arise from Members' accrued
              pension rights to be met.                                             
              The Technical Provisions assumptions include appropriate margin to allow for the possibility of events turning
              out worse than expected. However, the funding method and assumptions do not completely remove the risk
              that the Technical Provisions could be insufficient to provide benefits in the future.
              A formal actuarial valuation of SAUL is carried out every three years by a professionally qualified and
              independent actuary. The last actuarial valuation was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2020.
              Informal reviews of SAUL's position, reflecting changes in market conditions, cash flow information and new
              accrual of benefits, are carried out between formal valuations.       
              The funding principles were agreed by the Trustee and employers in June 2021 and will be reviewed again at
              SAUL's next formal valuation in 2023.                                 
                                                                                    
              At the 31 March 2020 valuation SAUL was 94% funded on its Technical Provisions basis. However, market
              movements following the valuation date were positive and the Trustee and Employers agreed to allow for
              post-valuation experience up to 30 April 2021. As SAUL was in surplus on its Technical Provisions basis at
              that date, no deficit contributions were required. However, the Trustee and the Employers agreed that the
              ongoing Employers' contributions would increase from a rate of 16% of CARE Salaries to 19% of CARE
              salaries from 1 April 2022 and to 21% of CARE Salaries from 1 January 2023.
              Employer contribution rates for SAUL Start are set at 16%, employee contribution rates are the same as for
              the defined benefit scheme.                                           
              Accounting Policy                                                     
                                                                                    
              Birkbeck is a Participating member in SAUL. The actuarial valuation applies to SAUL as a whole and does not
              identify surpluses or deficits applicable to individual employers. As a whole, the market value of SAUL's
              assets at 31 March 2020 was £3,612 million representing 94% of the liabilities. The market value of SAUL's
              assets at 30 April 2021 was £4,369 million representing 109% of the estimated liabilities.
              It is not possible to identify an individual Employer's share of the underlying assets and liabilities of SAUL.
              Birkbeck accounts for its participation in SAUL as if it were a defined contribution scheme and pension costs
              are based on the amounts actually paid (i.e. cash amounts) in accordance with paragraphs 28.11 of FRS
              102.                                                                  
              Although there was a Technical Provision deficit at 31 March 2020, allowing for post valuation experience to
              30 April 2021, SAUL has a Technical Provisions surplus. Therefore no deficit contributions were required
              following the 2020 valuation and there is no defined benefit liability (i.e. the present value of any deficit
              contributions due to SAUL) to be recognised by the University.
