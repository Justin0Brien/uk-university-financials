FOREWORD    BY THE  VICE CHANCELLOR                                         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      Despite significant changes to the way higher education is funded in the    
      UK, Aston University is performing very well across a range of measures.    
      We have a solid financial base, with a growing surplus and we continue to   
      invest in campus developments, the student experience, and teaching and     
      research staff.                                                             
                                                                                  
      Aston is highly attractive to students, with a rising undergraduate intake that
      is more than a thousand more than it was a decade ago. This year we will    
      register over 2,600 first years.                                            
                                                                                  
      According to the Sunday Times ‘you will struggle to find a University in    
      Britain more attuned to the needs of business and industry’, which is one of
      the reasons our graduate employability remains one of the best, beating     
                                                                                  
      Oxford.                                                                     
      Our integrated placement year is becoming more and more popular, with       
                                                                                  
      nearly 70% of our students spending a year in business, a year abroad, or   
      in pre-registration across subjects allied to medicine.                     
                                                                                  
      Our research income is rising – awards up from £11 million in 2009 to £17.5 million today.
      This is derived from a wide variety of funding bodies including business, the EU, Research
      Councils and cross border collaborations.                                   
                                                                                  
      Our Financial Performance for 2012-13 was strong and we outperformed our budget
                                                                    Employable    
      assumptions.                                                                
                                                                    Graduates;    
      As we move forwards, we remain committed to the delivery of our 2020 Strategy. This has Exploitable
      two core aims: developing internationally sought after Aston Graduates and delivering Research
      world leading Aston Research. To achieve both we will need to continue to generate a
      growing financial surplus, and to operate in a financially prudent and sustainable way.
      This will be balanced by further investment in our estate, our research, and in our faculty.
      Whilst this is not straightforward in a complex and uncertain world, we are very confident
      that Aston University will move forwards to 2020 in a healthy and fiscally robust position.

      The overall aim of the University is set out in the 1966 Charter:           
                                                                                  
      “to advance, disseminate and apply learning and knowledge by                
      teaching and research for the benefit of industry and commerce and of       
                                                                                  
      the community generally and to enable students to obtain the                
      advantage of a university education.”                                       
                                                                                  
      Such teaching and research may include periods outside the University in industry or
      commerce or wherever the University considers proper for the best advancement of its
      objects.                                                                    
                                                                                  
      The University strategy, Going Forward to 2020, builds on the provisions and powers
      outlined in the Charter.

                The Future                                                        
                                                                                  
                We have some significant challenges to deal with across the sector over the next few
                years. These include increasing competition, nationally and globally, reduction in funding
                for infrastructure, key demographic changes and the need to encourage students and
                research funders to see universities as important in their development plans.
                                                                                  
                There is an imperative to keep in the mind of stakeholders the major advantages that
                universities have for the economy and individuals. Aston is in a strong position to situate
                itself as an institution which transforms lives. We are, therefore, seeking to take
                advantage of our strengths to bring about significant growth and a rise in reputation.
                                                                                  
                We intend to do this by continuing to encourage high potential students from all
                backgrounds to gain the benefits of degrees at Aston and of the social mobility which this
                                                                                  
                experience will bring. We will continue to build on our historic reputation for supporting
                our students and graduates to be amongst the most employable global citizens within a
                competitive graduate market place. To do this we will keep investing in our student
                experience, in high quality teaching and the professional development of those who
                deliver this. We will take advantage of the diversity of our students to help them learn
                from each other and we will use innovative learning methods to help them gain this, as
                well as encouraging as many students as possible to study a foreign language or work or
                study abroad. As part of this initiative we continue to work towards our target of 100% of

                We are already working to build on our excellent National Student Survey results in 2013,

                We are seeing more cross-School interdisciplinary research activity than ever before and
                this will help us in our objective of increasing our profile internationally.
                Our relationship with business, communities and the professions remains strongly at the
                centre of what we do, as it has since our inception in 1895. We will continue to build on
                our close relationships with companies but also on the work established more recently
                with SMEs via Graduate Advantage internships, BSeen enterprise activity with staff,
                students and graduates, the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Programme and
                our world leading research in this area.

      Increasingly our activities have a global reach. We also have more than 120 countries
      represented on campus and we are now expanding our reach by running programmes
      with partners across the world.                                             
                                                                                  
      These include leading on the new Vietnam-UK University in Danang, significant
      collaborations in the health sciences in Singapore, Italy and Vietnam, double degrees in
      Business and Social Sciences with a number of European institutions and engineering
      programmes in India, Malaysia and Africa. All these initiatives, and others, are allowing
      us to expand beyond the space of our Aston campus.                          
                                                                                  
      In order to do all these good things we continue to work to ensure our resource and
      estates infrastructure is fit for purpose and as efficient as possible. Major investments will
      allow us to expand student numbers and also the quality of our provision to support

      In March 2012 we launched the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (AIPT) which
      has enabled us to build on our long history of research in this area, and attract new
      investment.

                Aston University has implemented a number of initiatives in the last year that have helped
                drive the University forward with its sustainable agenda. The following are the main areas
                where it is felt Aston has made a significant improvement in our carbon emissions as well
                as improving our corporate responsibility:

                Zero Waste from Halls campaign was run for a third year where all resident students were
                encouraged to donate their unwanted items to the British Heart Foundation. The
                donations diverted a large amount of waste from landfill whilst raising money for the
                charity.                                                          
                A second Solar Photovoltaic (PV) was installed to harvest solar energy. The new system
                was fitted onto our Vision Science building and helps generate around 20,000 kWh a year.
                                                                                  
                Aston University has been shortlisted in the Energy Efficient Data Centre Project of the
                Year category of the Energy Awards 2013. Its submission looked at the recent changes
                                                                                  
                Information Systems Aston (ISA) have made to the main data centre that have helped
                reduce electricity significantly including the installation of a free cooling ventilation system.
                                                                                  
                Aston was highly commended for two Green Gown Awards that recognise the exceptional
                sustainability initiatives undertaken by universities and colleges across the UK. This was
                in the ‘Construction and Refurbishment’ category for our entry ‘Historic Woodcock Sports
                Centre Project’ and in the ‘Research and Development’ category for ‘The European
                Bioenergy Research Institute’.                                    
                                                                                  
                A number of areas have had LED lighting technology installed replacing old inefficient
                lighting. Such areas include three main PC labs on the 4th floor, the Main Building
                entrance, Car Park 12 and the lighting throughout the roadway in the lower ground of the
                Main Building.                                                    
                                                                                  
                The annual Go Green Week was repeated for the fourth year putting on over 30 individual

      Equality and Diversity                                                      
                                                                                  
      Aston University seeks to eliminate discrimination and promote equality and diversity
      throughout the University. Its policies aim to ensure fair and consistent employment
      practices for staff; fair admissions, teaching, learning and assessment processes for
      students and a positive working environment that promotes dignity and respect for all.
                                                                                  
      A commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion is embedded in Aston’s culture and
      values, and is key to the delivery of Aston 2020 - the University’s Strategic Plan.
                                                                                  
      Aston’s equality reports and action plans are published on its website:

      Principal Risks and Uncertainties                                           
                                                                                  
      The University identifies and manages its strategic risks via a robust risk management
      process, ensuring appropriate mitigating actions are employed. The principal risks facing
      the University are those which the wider Higher Education sector is faced with:
                                                                                  
      Poor student experience leading to decreased uptake of student places       
                                                                                  
      Fundamentally the University must continue to improve students’ total experience,
      including learning, employment prospects and quality of student life.       
                                                                                  
      •   Aston uses the National Student Survey and league tables to assess its  
          performance and inform relevant policies.                               
                                                                                  
      •   Aston’s strategies to maintain its top performance in graduate employability are kept
          under constant review.                                                  
      •   Aston is investing heavily in its campus, teaching and research facilities to meet
          student expectations.                                                   
                                                                                  
      Attracting high quality international students is essential for the University but is affected
      by Government policy and UKBA requirements.                                 
                                                                                  
      •   Internal audit conducted a focussed review of the University’s UKBA processes and
          confirmed that they are fit for purpose and working satisfactorily. As a result of the
          audit we have implemented further improvements in this area.            
                                                                                  
      Reduced research funding                                                    
                                                                                  
      Improving research reputation and increasing research funding is a key part of University
      strategy. The University monitors its research performance closely and is investing to

                Insufficient financial resources to achieve objectives            
                                                                                  
                Ensuring financial sustainability at a time of reduced Government funding, research
                funding constraints and more competition is essential.            
                                                                                  
                •   Aston has mitigated this risk by producing a strategic financial plan through to
                    2019/20 to give a balanced assessment of income, expenditure, operating surplus,
                    capital investment and sources of funding. The strategic financial plan is consistent
                    with overall University goals and provides a framework for strategic decision making.
                    It also sets the targets for detailed annual plans.           
                •   Aston has also expanded its Value for Money strategy to include a process
                    efficiency initiative, APEx (Aston Process Excellence). APEx will introduce a culture
                                                                                  
                    of continuous improvement in the University and enable the University to grow more
                    efficiently and generate more cash for investment or as a buffer against unforeseen
                    developments.                                                 
                                                                                  
                Operational issues lead to reduced performance                    
                                                                                  
                People are at the heart of the University’s success. Creating a performance culture and
                recruiting and retaining talent are key parts of University strategy.
                                                                                  
                •   “Aston First”, an expression of Aston’s values, was launched in 2010 and continues
                    to be promoted throughout the University. These values reinforce a performance
                    culture and are consistent with our staff appraisal system.   
                •   Aston continues to invest in staff training and communication.
                •   Aston benefits from low staff attrition.                      
                                                                                  
                The University is dependent on a comprehensive and effective IT infrastructure which is
                both open to the needs of students and academics whilst secure and resilient.
                                                                                  
                •   Aston is embarking on a strategic review of IT ensuring that its IT infrastructure
                    meets future requirements.                                    
                •   Aston has an effective IT disaster recovery plan.             
                                                                                  
                •   Internal audit conducted a review of IT security in 2012-13. Whist the review was

      Total income has risen by 5% to £117.1m. Key drivers of growth are the changes to
      student funding, research and increased student population. Operating surplus before
                                                                                  
      exceptional items has risen to £3.5m, a £1.2m (53%) increase. The improved surplus is
      due to higher income and containment of costs. 2012-13 saw another year of high capital
      investment of £19.0m bringing the total investment made over the last 3 years to £58.3m.
      Cash reserves are declining due to the high investment but still remain at £22.2m at the
      end of the year.

      The overall number of students has increased from last year with a total population for
      2012-13 of 11,352, a growth of just over 2%. Local students (from Birmingham and the
      West Midlands) represent 34% and international students represent 32% of the total
      student population.

      reducing the grant received to 24% of the total income compared to 30% last year. This
      decrease is more than offset by higher tuition fees directly from students or via the

OPERATING   AND  FINANCIAL  REVIEW                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      Other Income                                                                
                                                                                  
      Other operating income has risen by 1% to £15.3m. The largest component of other
      income is residences, catering and conferences which together grew by 1% to £6.8m.
      Income from exploitation of intellectual property rights (IPR) arising out of academic work
      of £1.4m was flat year on year. Erasmus grants also rose by 52% but are a matched
      income and cost. The newly refurbished Sir Doug Ellis Woodcock Sports Centre opened
      its doors in October 2011 leading to a 10% increase in sports and recreation income for
                                                                                  
      the full year 2012-13.                                                      
                                                                                  
      Staff Costs                                                                 
                                                                                  
      Staff costs rose by 5% to £64.8m representing 55% of income. The increase was due to
      the national pay award of 1% and staff mix changes. Academic staff have risen by 24
      FTE and administrative staff by 21 offset by a decrease in clerical staff of 19 FTE. There
      were no restructuring costs in the year and these figures include the FRS17 pension
      adjustments.                                                                
                                                                                  
      Pensions                                                                    
                                                                                  
      The University’s staff are eligible to join one of two main defined benefit pension schemes:
      the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and the Aston University Pension
      Scheme (AUPS). USS is an independent scheme run principally for the benefit of higher
      education institutions and AUPS is a scheme for Aston University employees, sponsored
                                                                                  
      by the University. Defined benefit schemes represent a risk as the liability to fund the
      defined benefits is both uncapped and long-lasting.                         
                                                                                  
      USS has taken steps to manage its liabilities by amending its scheme so that from 1st
      October 2012 new members’ pensions are calculated on a career average basis rather
      than a final salary basis and employees, as well as the employers, will contribute towards
      pension deficits.                                                           
                                                                                  
      AUPS has already changed to a career average scheme and the University will continue
      to take advice and consult with trustees about measures to manage its liability to the
      scheme.                                                                     
                                                                                  
      The Aston University Pension Scheme deficit reported under FRS17, has decreased from
      £5.8m at the start of the year to £1.1m at the end.                         
                                                                                  
      The University also participated in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LPGS) which
      was closed this year when the University’s last active member retired.

OPERATING   AND  FINANCIAL  REVIEW                                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                Other Operating Expenses                                          
                                                                                  
                Operating expenses rose by £3.4m mainly in support of improved academic delivery.
                Residencies, catering and conferences have increased costs as a result of outsourcing
                the conferencing contract to a third party provider instead of using in house staff. Aston
                continues to invest in its estates leading to an increase in expenditure classed as
                maintenance costs.                                                
                                                                                  
                The annual depreciation charge has fallen by 18% following the £2m accelerated
                depreciation for the Gosta Green site in 2011-12. The site was reclassified as a fixed
                asset on 31 July 2011.                                            
                                                                                  
                Capital Expenditure                                               
                                                                                  
                The University has continued to modernise and extend its facilities for teaching, research
                                                                                  
                and students, with capital investment of £19.0m in 12-13 (£16.8m in 11-12). Key
                developments in the year were: European Bioenergy Research Institute, Sir Doug Ellis
                Woodcock Sports Centre, School of Engineering and Applied Science particularly new
                chemical engineering laboratories and completion of the refurbishment of the library.
                                                                                  
                The construction of phase 2 of the new residences by Aston Student Villages (ASV) was
                completed in September 2013. The second phase of the development added a further
                1,063 rooms to the 1,307 new en-suite rooms completed in phase 1 of construction.
                Following completion of phase 2, ASV has over 3,000 student rooms on campus which
                are all available for the 2013/14 student intake.                 
                                                                                  
                The capital expenditure on the new residences is reflected in the accounts of ASV. ASV
                is an independent, registered charity, whose Board comprises Trustees appointed by the
                University, the facilities management company and the funder nominated independents.
                                                                                  
                Balance Sheet                                                     
                                                                                  
                The University continues to maintain a strong balance sheet. Net assets at 31 July 2013
                                                                                  
                were £88.7m including reserves of £63.8m.                         
                Fixed assets have increased to £119.2m at net book value following the capital spend in
                                                                                  
                the year. There is a legal charge on some fixed assets as security for bank loans which
                have an outstanding balance of £36.9m.                            
                                                                                  
                Tuition fee debtor collections have been strong in the year with only 0.7% remaining
                uncollected at year end. Work is ongoing with the Student Loan Company to ensure that
                cash flows are optimised and outstanding debts limited. Overall debtor levels remain low
                compared with current liabilities due to the forward phasing of some of the main
                components of debtors such as HEFCE grants or accommodation receipts.
                                                                                  
                The reduction in the AUPS and LGPS pension liabilities has decreased the pension deficit
                by £6.7m although provisions and charges have risen by £1.7m to account for the LGPS
                liability under FRS12: Provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities.

      Cash and liquid resources have decreased by £5.1m to £22.2m (2011-12: £27.3m). The Capital
      University generated £9.2m of cash from operating activities in the year and had capital
                                                                    investment of 
      investment of £19.0m. Cash received from donations and endowments was low and in
                                                                    £19m

      The outstanding borrowings of the University were £36.9m amortising to 2037.
      Bank interest generated on the University cash deposits was £0.2m (11-12: £0.3m). This
      represents an average rate of return during the year of 1.0% (11-12: 1.0%). The interest
      rates that the University is currently able to attract are ranging between 0.25% - 1.40%
      depending on the term of the deposit.                                       
      Interest payable has reduced this year to £1.4m (11-12: £1.7m) driven by two factors; a
      £10m tranche of the £40m loan converted from a higher fixed interest rate to a lower Libor
      based interest rate from September 2012 and there were no FRS17 interest charges in

        Council continues to comply with the CUC Governance Code of Practice and the Model Financial
        Memorandum between HEFCE and Higher Education Institutions which includes the HEFCE Audit
        Code of Practice. This includes a comprehensive risk assessment and management process which is
        now firmly established and monitored by the Audit Committee on behalf of Council. Audit Committee
        reviews policies and processes that ensure value for money is delivered by the University, whilst the
        Finance and Major Projects Committee assesses the costs, risks and benefits associated with major

        The University’s Charter, Statutes and Ordinances set out the arrangements for the governance and
        management of the institution. The University’s Council and its committees monitor the performance
                                                                                  
        of management and assure an effective corporate strategy. The Senate and its committees assure
        and enhance the quality and standards of taught and research programmes, as well as maintaining
        and improving the quality of the student experience. The Executive Team supports the Vice-
        Chancellor in providing strategic leadership and management to ensure that Aston remains a
        financially and academically successful institution, operating in accordance with the strategic goals,
        policies and processes approved by Council and Senate.                    
                                                                                  
        The University is committed to exhibiting current best practice in all aspects of corporate governance.
        The University Council has adopted, and complies with, the recommendations of the Committee of
        University Chair’s Governance Code of Practice and General Principles, as incorporated within the
        CUC Guide for Members of HE Governing Bodies in the UK and most recently published in March
                                                                                  
        2009. This is reflected in the Statement of the Council’s Primary Responsibilities:
        (http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/university-governance/council/statement-of-the-councils-primary-
        responsibilities/).                                                       
                                                                                  
        Council                                                                   
                                                                                  
        The University's Council comprises lay members, students and employees appointed under the
        Statutes of the University, the majority of whom are non-executive. The roles of Chancellor and Pro-
        Chancellor of the Council are separated from the role of the University's Chief Executive, the Vice-
        Chancellor. The matters specifically reserved to the Council for decision are set out in the Statutes of
        the University, by custom and under the Financial Memorandum with the Higher Education Funding
        Council for England.                                                      
                                                                                  
        The Council is responsible for the approval of plans for the on-going strategic direction of the
        University, approval of major developments and the receipt of regular reports from Executive Officers
        on the day-to-day operations of its business and its subsidiary companies. In addition, members of
        the Council have an annual strategy away day, focussing on the development and implementation of
                                                                                  
        strategy.                                                                 
        The Council meets at least five times a year and has several Committees, including an Audit
                                                                                  
        Committee; a Finance and Major Projects Committee; a Nominations Committee; and a
        Remuneration Committee.                                                   
                                                                                  
        All of these Committees are formally constituted with terms of reference. They comprise mainly lay
        members of Council or independent co-opted members, one of whom is the Chair.

      In respect of its strategic and development responsibilities, the Council receives recommendations
      and advice from the University Executive Team and the Senate, the body responsible for the
      University’s academic affairs.                                              
                                                                                  
      Senate                                                                      
                                                                                  
      The Senate is the supreme academic authority of the University, responsible for the award of
      degrees, and for the regulation and superintendence of academic programmes (teaching and
      research). It also regulates the admission, examination and discipline of students, and has
      responsibility for the oversight and maintenance of academic standards, exercised both through its
      Learning and Teaching and Research Committees.                              
                                                                                  
      Committees                                                                  
                                                                                  
      The Finance and Major Projects Committee recommends to Council the University's annual revenue
      and capital budgets, and monitors performance both in respect of operations and of major capital
      projects against the approved budgets. The Audit Committee has responsibility for the
      recommendation of the Financial Statements to Council.                      
                                                                                  
      The Audit Committee considers detailed reports on the University’s systems of internal control, risk
      management and governance including management’s plans to implement actions to comply with
      those recommendations. It considers reports on the effectiveness of value for money and purchasing
                                                                                  
      policies and procedures. It also receives and considers reports from the Higher Education Funding
      Council for England as they affect the University's business, and monitors adherence with the
      regulatory requirements.                                                    
                                                                                  
      The Nominations Committee considers nominations for, and makes recommendations to the Council
      for filling vacancies in the Council’s lay category of membership under the relevant Statute. Those lay
      members are eligible for re-appointment when they retire by rotation.       
                                                                                  
      The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the most senior staff, including the
      Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor’s performance objectives are agreed each year with the Chair
      of the Council and Remuneration Committee. Appraisals take place on a regular basis throughout the
      year.

      The Vice-Chancellor is supported by the University Executive team. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor
      assists the Vice-Chancellor in the management of the University and acts as her deputy. The Pro-
      Vice-Chancellors (PVC) are senior appointees who assist the Vice-Chancellor in specific areas of
      academic development including the delivery of the institutional strategic objectives. The academic
      activity of the University is organised into four Schools of Study, each lead by an Executive Dean,
                                                                                  
      who are also members of Executive. The final members of the Executive are the Chief Financial
      Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director of Capital Developments, Executive Director of
      Campaigns and Executive Director of Marketing Strategy and Communications.

        Internal Control                                                          
                                                                                  
        The Council is responsible for the University's system of internal control and for reviewing its
        effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to
        achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
        material misstatement or loss.                                            
                                                                                  
        The key elements of the University's system of internal control, which is designed to ensure that there
        is a robust and effective control environment, include a robust Audit Committee with regular reporting
        to Council whose responsibilities include review of the risk register and the internal control
        environment. Audit Committee receives reports from a professional Internal Audit team whose annual
        programme is approved by the Committee and whose head provides the Committee with a report on
        internal audit activity within the University and an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of
                                                                                  
        internal control, including internal financial control. Audit Committee also receives comments made
        by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports.    
                                                                                  
        Financial Control                                                         
        Council is charged with taking reasonable steps to ensure that funds from the HEFCE are used only
                                                                                  
        for the purposes for which they have been given and in accordance with the Financial Memorandum
        with the HEFCE; to ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to
        safeguard public funds and funds from other sources; to safeguard the University’s assets and
        prevent and detect fraud; and to secure the economical, efficient and effective management of the
        University's resources and expenditure.                                   
                                                                                  
        To ensure these, Council has approved Finance and Governance Regulations, detailing financial
        controls and procedures and processes for risk management and the management of conflicts of
        interest. The regulations are approved by Council and subject to regular review. The University has
        clearly defined and formalised requirements for approval and control of expenditure including with
        investment decisions involving capital or revenue expenditure being subject to formal detailed
                                                                                  
        appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the Council.     
        Risk assessment and internal control are embedded in ongoing operations through clear definitions of
                                                                                  
        the responsibilities of, and the authority delegated to, heads of academic and administrative
        departments.                                                              
                                                                                  
        Council has set a comprehensive long, medium and short-term planning process, supplemented by
        detailed annual income, expenditure, capital and cash flow budgets. Council carries out regular
        reviews of key performance indicators (KPIs) against its strategic targets and quarterly reviews of
        financial results involving variance reporting and updates of forecast outturns. The KPIs were revised
        to take account of the Aston 2020 strategy by the Executive in 2012-13 and to be more closely
        aligned with the Risk Register. The KPIs encompass student success measures together with
        financial and non-financial indicators which include monitoring of research activity, results of staff and
        student surveys and assessment of the University estate.                  
                                                                                  
        The Council is responsible for ensuring that the University maintains proper accounting records which
        disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the University and enable Council to
                                                                                  
        ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the University’s Charter, the
        Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting in Further and Higher Education Institutions and
        other relevant accounting standards. The Council, within the terms and conditions of a Financial
        Memorandum agreed between the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and itself,

CORPORATE    GOVERNANCE    STATEMENT                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      through its designated office holder, is required to approve financial statements for each financial year
      which give a true and fair view of the University’s state of affairs and of the surplus or deficit and cash
      flows for that year.                                                        
                                                                                  
      In 2012-13, the Council approved the adoption of a new University Ethics Framework reflecting
      Aston’s commitment to high ethical standards and regulatory compliance, and setting out the broad
      range of regulations, policies and practices which govern its relationships with colleagues, customers,
      partners, suppliers and other stakeholders. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee were also
      extended to include the provision of assurance to Council on the effectiveness of the oversight and
      operation of the University’s Ethics Framework.                             
                                                                                  
      The University also has comprehensive Personnel Policies including all phases of employment, and
      all aspects of equal opportunities, whistle-blowing, grievances and harassment and appropriate
                                                                                  
      procedures for the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor and other senior officers and for monitoring
      their performance including a Remuneration Committee for senior staff.      
                                                                                  
      Risk Management                                                             
      The University has a strategic risk register which is compiled and reviewed by the Executive. The
                                                                                  
      University has a Head of Strategic Risk who manages the operational activities on behalf of Council.
      Risks are split between operational and environmental risks and include financial and non-financial
      risks. Mitigations and sources of assurance are considered for all risks. Tactical risks are held at
      School or working group level and are an integral part of all governance and operating activities.
                                                                                  
      The Audit Committee reviews the University’s strategic risk register at regular intervals and reports its
      observations to the Council, which undertakes reviews of strategic risk management on a twice-yearly
      basis. The University has, in the view of the Committee, developed effective and robust procedures
      and controls for the management of risk.                                    
                                                                                  
      In order to provide assurance that the above process is operating effectively, Internal Audit
      undertakes an annual review of the University’s procedures for governance and risk management,
      and its arrangements to promote value for money, as well as the underlying control and monitoring
      processes. The Internal Audit Annual Report 2012-13 concluded that overall, in the areas examined,
                                                                                  
      the risk management activities and controls were suitably designed to achieve the risk management
      objectives required by management.                                          
                                                                                  
      Accounting Basis                                                            
      The Council has ensured that suitable accounting policies are selected and applied consistently;
                                                                                  
      judgements and estimates are made that are reasonable and prudent; applicable accounting
      standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
      financial statements; and financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis unless it is
      inappropriate to presume that the University will continue in operation.    
                                                                                  
      Going Concern                                                               
                                                                                  
      The Council has considered the University’s academic and financial position, with due regard to its
      cash flows, liquidity and borrowings, and future expectations as set out in the operating and financial
      review. It is satisfied that the University has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
      foreseeable future and for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the
      preparation of the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT   AUDITOR’S  REPORT   TO THE  COUNCIL  OF ASTON               
        UNIVERSITY                                                                
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        We have audited the group and University financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Aston
        University for the year ended 31 July 2013 which comprise the Consolidated Income and Expenditure
        Account, the Consolidated and University Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement,
        the Statement of Consolidated Total Recognised Gains and Losses , the Accounting Policies and the
        related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
        applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
        Accounting Practice).                                                     
                                                                                  
        This report is made solely to the Council, in accordance with the Charters and Statutes of the
        institution. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Council those matters
        we are required to state to it in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
                                                                                  
        permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council for our
        audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.          
                                                                                  
        Respective Responsibilities of the University’s Council and Auditor       
                                                                                  
        As explained more fully in the Statement of Responsibilities of the University’s Council set out on
        page 23, the Council is responsible for the preparation of financial statements which give a true and
        fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion, on the financial statements in
        accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
        standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
                                                                                  
        Scope of the audit of the financial statements                            
                                                                                  
        An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
        sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
        misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
        accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and University’s circumstances and have been
                                                                                  
        consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
        made by the Council and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all
        the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies
        with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
        inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.              
                                                                                  
        Opinion on financial statements                                           
                                                                                  
        In our opinion the financial statements:                                  
                                                                                  
          •  give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Group and University as at 31 July
             2013 and of the Group’s income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and cash flows
             for the year then ended;                                             
          •  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted

      Opinion on other matters prescribed in the HEFCE Audit Code of Practice issued
      under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992                             
                                                                                  
      In our opinion, in all material respects:                                   
                                                                                  
        •  funds from whatever source administered by the University for specific purposes have been
           properly applied to those purposes                                     
        •  income has been applied in accordance with the University's statutes; and
        •  funds provided by HEFCE have been applied in accordance with the Financial Memorandum
           and any other terms and conditions attached to them.                   
                                                                                  
      Matters on which we are required to report by exception                     
                                                                                  
      We have nothing to report in respect of the following matter where the HEFCE Audit Code of Practice
      issued under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion
                                                                                  
      the statement of internal control included as part of the Corporate Governance Statement is
      inconsistent with our knowledge of the University and group.

        activities.                                                               
                                                                                  
        Recognition of income                                                     
                                                                                  
        Income from research grants, contracts and other services rendered are included to the extent of the
        equivalent expenditure incurred during the year and any related contributions towards overhead
                                                                                  
        costs; any payments received in advance of such performance are recognised on the balance sheet
        as liabilities. Income from short-term deposits is credited to the income and expenditure account in
        the period in which it is earned.                                         
                                                                                  
        Income from endowments is credited to the income and expenditure account in the period in which it
        is earned. Income from restricted endowments not expended in accordance with the restrictions of
        the endowment, is transferred from the income and expenditure to restricted endowments. Any
        realised gains or losses from dealing in the related assets are retained within the endowment in the
        balance sheet.                                                            
                                                                                  
        Donations with restrictions are recognised when relevant conditions have been met; in many cases
        recognition is directly related to expenditure incurred on specific purposes, Donations which are to be
        retained for the benefit of the institution are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and
        losses and in endowments; other donations are recognised by inclusion as other income in the
        income and expenditure account.                                           
                                                                                  
        Recurrent grants from the Funding Councils are recognised in the period in which they are receivable.
                                                                                  
        Non-recurrent grants from Funding Councils or other bodies are recognised in the period in which
        they are received, unless the grant terms require the grant to be matched to specific expenditure, in
        which case the income is recognised to the extent of the equivalent expenditure during the year.

      STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      Non-recurrent grants from Funding Councils or other bodies received in respect of the acquisition or
      construction of fixed assets are treated as deferred capital grants and amortised in line with
      depreciation over the life of the assets.                                   
                                                                                  
      Maintenance of premises                                                     
                                                                                  
      The University has a ten-year rolling long-term maintenance plan, which forms the basis of the on-
      going maintenance of the estate. The cost of long term and routine corrective maintenance is
      charged to the income and expenditure account as incurred.                  
                                                                                  
      Foreign currency translation                                                
                                                                                  
      Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the
      dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
      translated into sterling at year-end rates. The resulting exchange differences are dealt with in the
      determination of income and expenditure for the financial year.             
                                                                                  
      Pension schemes                                                             
                                                                                  
      Retirement benefits for most employees of the University are provided by The Universities
      Superannuation Scheme (USS) and Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). These are defined
                                                                                  
      benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted out of the State Second Pension. The
      University also had one member in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) who retired in
      2012-13. Until 2011-12, this scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. In
      2011-12 the University reviewed this policy, and decided to account for the scheme as a defined
      benefit scheme.                                                             
                                                                                  
      Contributions to USS are charged to the income and expenditure account so as to spread the cost of
      pensions over employees’ working lives with the University in such a way that the pension cost is a
      substantially level percentage of present and future pensionable payroll. Variations from regular costs
      are spread over the expected average remaining working lifetime of members of the schemes after
      making allowances for further withdrawals. The contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on
                                                                                  
      the basis of triennial valuations using a prospective benefit method.       
      In accordance with FRS 17 Accounting for Retirement Benefits, the assets of AUPS are measured
                                                                                  
      using market values for the current year. Liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and
      discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and
      currency to the liability. The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the scheme expected to
      arise from employee service in the period is charged to the operating surplus. The expected return on
      the scheme’s assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the scheme’s
      liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in pension finance costs. Actuarial gains and
      losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

        STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        Tangible fixed assets                                                     
                                                                                  
        Land and buildings                                                        
                                                                                  
        Land and buildings are included in the Balance Sheet at valuation as at 1 August 1994, with
        subsequent additions at cost. The valuation was performed by Chartered Surveyors DTZ Debenham
        Thorpe on the basis of depreciated replacement cost for the main campus together with open market
        value for properties off-campus. The total valuation at the time amounted to £52.8 million and the
        resulting £41.1 million excess over net book value was taken to the Revaluation Reserve. On
        disposal, any valuation surplus realised is transferred from the Revaluation Reserve to the Income
        and Expenditure account.                                                  
                                                                                  
        Land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite useful life. New buildings, including
        extensions, are depreciated over their expected useful lives of 40 years, major building renovation
        and conversion is depreciated over 20 years and general building improvements are depreciated over
        10 years.                                                                 
                                                                                  
        Where buildings are acquired with the aid of specific grants they are capitalised and depreciated as
        above. The related grants are treated as deferred capital grants in the Balance Sheet and released to
                                                                                  
        income over the expected useful life of the buildings.                    
        Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of land and buildings have been
                                                                                  
        capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.                          
        A review for impairment of a fixed asset is carried out if events or changes in circumstances indicate
                                                                                  
        that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.       
        Buildings under construction are accounted for at cost, based on the value of architects’ certificates
                                                                                  
        and other direct costs incurred to 31 July. They are not depreciated until they are brought into use.
                                                                                  
        In accordance with FRS 15 the University has opted to take the one-off opportunity to freeze the
        valuations at the date of the implementation of FRS 15 for the first time.

        Equipment costing less than £10,000 (£500 until 31 July 2008) per individual item is written off to the

        Where equipment is acquired with the aid of specific grants it is capitalised and depreciated in
        accordance with the above policy, with the related grant being credited to a deferred capital grant
        account and released to income and expenditure account over the expected useful economic life of
        the related equipment.

      Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
                                                                                  
      Leasing agreements that transfer to the University substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership
      of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in fixed

      element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged to the
      income and expenditure account in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. Assets
      held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful economic
      lives of equivalent owned assets.                                           
                                                                                  
      Assets which are held under hire purchase contracts which have the characteristics of finance leases
      are depreciated over their useful lives.                                    
                                                                                  
      Heritage Assets                                                             
                                                                                  
      The University does not hold any heritage assets. However in the event that these are acquired then
      assets costing or valued at over £10,000 would be capitalised at cost or value on acquisition, where
      such a valuation is reasonably obtainable. Other heritage assets would not be capitalised.
                                                                                  
      Investments                                                                 
                                                                                  
      Fixed asset investments that are not listed on a recognised stock exchange are carried at historical
      cost less any provision for impairment in their value.                      
                                                                                  
      Investment property is accounted for in accordance with SSAP 19 where the property is carried at
      open market value.                                                          
                                                                                  
      Investments that form part of Endowment Assets are included in the balance sheet at market value.
                                                                                  
      Current asset investments are included in the balance sheet at the lower of their original cost and net
      realisable value.                                                           
                                                                                  
      Stocks                                                                      
                                                                                  
      Stocks are stated at the lower of their cost and net realisable value. Where necessary, provision is
      made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.

      The University is an exempt charity within the meaning of schedule 3 of the Charities Act 2012
      (formerly schedule 2 of the Charities Act 1993) and is considered to pass the tests set out in
                                                                                  
      Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 Finance Act 2011 and therefore meets the definition of a charitable company
      for UK corporation tax purposes. Accordingly, the University is potentially exempt from taxation in
      respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered by section 287 CTA2009 and
      sections 471, and 478-488 CTA 2011 (formerly section 505 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988)
      or section 256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains
      are applied to exclusively charitable purposes.

NOTES  TO THE  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS                                      
        STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        The University receives no similar exemption in respect of Value Added Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on
        inputs is included in the costs of such inputs. Any irrecoverable VAT allocated to tangible fixed assets
        is included in their cost.                                                
                                                                                  
        Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet
        date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they
        crystallise based on current rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of
        income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are
        included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are regarded
        as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not
        discounted.                                                               
                                                                                  
        The University’s subsidiary companies are subject to corporation tax and VAT in the same way as any
        commercial organisation.                                                  
                                                                                  
        Cash flow and liquid resources                                            
                                                                                  
        Cash flows comprise increases or decrease in cash. Cash includes cash in hand, cash at bank, and
        deposits repayable on demand.                                             
                                                                                  
        Liquid resources include sums on short-term deposits with recognised banks and building societies
        and government securities. They include any such assets held as endowments asset investments.
                                                                                  
        Provisions                                                                
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        Provisions are recognised when the institution has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
        result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required to settle the
        obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

      The Vice Chancellor was awarded a performance related payment of £25,000 in 2012-13 (2011-12: £20,000) of
      which £12,000 (2011-12: £10,000) will be donated through salary sacrifice to University initiatives to support the
      development of women’s careers at Aston.                                    
      The emoluments of the Vice-Chancellor are shown on the same basis as for higher paid staff below, i.e.
      excluding employer's social security and pension contributions and including benefits in kind. The Vice
      Chancellor ceased active membership of USS in April 2012 and therefore there were no employer contributions
      in 2012-2013 (2011-12: £26,773 for 8 months). The University accrued contributions including interest of
      £42,753 (2011-12: £13,420 for 4 months) in respect of an unregistered, unfunded, retirement benefits scheme.

        Liabilities and Contingent Assets.) The LGPS is now closed to University active members.

NOTES  TO THE  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS                                        
                                                                                  
      24.  CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES                         
                                                                                  
      At the year end, capital commitments for items contracted for but not yet received by the University amounted to
      £9,104,829 (2011-12: £14,614,781).                                          
                                                                                  
      The University has a Section 278 Highways Act 1980 bond with Birmingham City Council for £31,282. This bond
      relates to the carrying out of works to Aston Street, Birmingham. In the event that the University fail to meet the
      terms of the Section 278 agreement the bond will be paid to Birmingham City Council.
                                                                                  
      The University has a contingent liability arising out of an employment tribunal (2011-12: nil).
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      25.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                             
                                                                                  
      Due to the nature of the University’s operations and the members of council being drawn from local, public and
      private sector organisations, it is inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a
      member of Council or a member of the senior management team may have an interest.
                                                                                  
      All such transactions, including those identified below, are conducted at arm’s length and in accordance with the
      University’s Financial Regulations and normal procurement procedures.       
                                                                                  
      The University has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 8 (Related Party Disclosures) and has not
      disclosed transactions with subsidiaries that are wholly owned.             
                                                                                  
      Related parties were identified by examining returns submitted by members of Council and senior management
      team members for the financial year 2012-13.

      The two principal pension schemes for the University's staff are the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
      and the Aston University Pension Scheme (AUPS). USS provides benefits based on final pensionable salary for
      academic and academic-related employees of all UK universities and other employees. AUPS provides
      similarly calculated benefits for other staff of the University. Whilst all of these schemes are defined benefit
      schemes, for the reasons explained below USS is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme. For
      the other schemes FRS17 requires the deficit in the scheme to be reflected in the accounts and the movements
      in the deficit to be reflected partly as a pension cost in the Income and Expenditure account and partly in the
      Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses. The University also participated in the Local Government
      Pension Scheme (LPGS) which was closed this year when the University’s last active member retired.
                                                                                  
      The total pension cost for the University was:                              
                                                          2012-13   2011-12

NOTES  TO THE  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS                                      
                                                                                  
        30.  PENSION SCHEMES continued                                            
                                                                                  
        USS                                                                       
                                                                                  
        The institution participates in the Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (USS), a defined benefit scheme
        which is externally funded and contracted out of the State Second Pension (S2P). The assets of the scheme are
        held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The institution is unable to identify its share of the underlying
        assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17
                                                                                  
        “Retirement benefits”, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
        As a result, the amount charged to the income and expenditure account represents the contributions payable to
        the scheme in respect of the accounting period.                           
                                                                                  
        The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2011. This was the second valuation for
        USS under the scheme-specific funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004, which requires schemes
        to adopt a stator funding objective, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover their technical
        provisions. The actuary also carries out regular reviews of the funding levels. In particular, he carries out a
        review of the funding level each year between triennial valuations and details of his estimate of the funding level
        at 31 March 2013 are also included in this note.                          
        The triennial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method. The assumptions which have the most
        significant effect of the result of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments (ie the
        valuation rate of interest), the rates of increase in salary and pensions and the assumed rates of morality. The
                                                                                  
        financial assumptions were derived from market yields prevailing at the valuation date. An “inflation risk
        premium” adjustment was also included by deducting 0.3% from the market-implied inflation on account of the
        determined rates or amounts, the shortfall at 31 March 2014 is estimated to be £2.2 billion, equivalent to a
        funding level of 95%. The contribution rate will be reviewed as part of each valuation and may be reviewed more
        frequently.                                                               
        The technical provisions relate essentially to the past service liabilities and funding levels, but it is also
        necessary to assess the ongoing cost of newly accruing benefits. The cost of future accrual was calculated
        using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the technical provisions but the allowance for
        promotional salary increases was not as high. Analysis has shown very variable levels of growth over and
        above general pay increases in recent years, and the salary growth assumption built into the cost of future
        accrual is based on more stable, historic, salary experience. However, when calculating the past service
        liabilities of the scheme, a cautionary reserve has been included, in addition, on account of the variability
        mentioned above.                                                          
                                                                                  
        As at the valuation date the Scheme was still a fully Final Salary Scheme for future accruals and the prevailing
        employer contribution rate was 16% of Salaries.                           
                                                                                  
        Following UK government legislation, from 2011 statutory pension increases or revaluations are based on the
        Consumer Prices Index measure of price inflation. Historically these increases had been based on the Retail
        Prices Index measure of prices inflation.

      30.  PENSION SCHEMES continued                                              
                                                                                  
      Since the valuation effective date, there have been a number of changes to the benefits provided by the scheme
      although these became effective from October 2011. These include:           
                                                                                  
      New Entrants:                                                               
      Other than in specific, limited circumstances, new entrants are now provided on a Career Revalued Benefits
      (CRB) basis rather than a Final Salary (FS) basis.                          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      Normal pension age:                                                         
      The normal pension age was increased for future service and new entrants to age 65.
                                                                                  
      Flexible Retirement                                                         
      Flexible retirement options were introduced.                                
                                                                                  
      Member contributions increased                                              
      Contributions were uplifted to 7.5% p.a. and 6.5% p.a. for FS Section members and CRB section members
      respectively.                                                               
                                                                                  
      Cost sharing                                                                
      If the total contribution level exceeds 23.5% of Salaries per annum, the employers will pay 65% of the excess
      over 23.5% and members would pay the remaining 35% to the fund as additional contributions.
                                                                                  
      Pensions increase cap                                                       
      For service derived after 30 September 2011, the USS will match increases in official pensions for the first 5%.
      If pensions increase by more than 5% then USS will pay half of the difference up to a maximum increase of
      10%.                                                                        
                                                                                  
      At 31 March 2013, USS had over 148,000 active members and the institution had 878 active members
      participating in the scheme.                                                
                                                                                  
      The total pension cost for the institution was £8,568,000 (2012: £8,276,000). This is includes £13,000 (2012:
      £19,000) outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date. The contribution rate payable by the institution
      was 16% of pensionable salaries. The next formal triennial actuarial valuation is due as at 31 March 2014.
                                                                                  
      AUPS                                                                        
                                                                                  
      The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. The Scheme is a defined benefit
      scheme which is funded and valued every three years by the actuary using the projected unit method, the rates
      of contribution payable being determined by the trustees on the advice of the actuary. A full actuarial valuation
      was carried out at 1 April 2010 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes by a qualified independent actuary. The
      material assumptions and other data used by the actuary were:

        Under the terms of an agreement between the University and AUPS, a restricted bank account is in place where
        in the case of the pension scheme being in deficit the University will make contributions of an agreed value.
        The accumulated funds will be transferred to AUPS as an additional contribution should the funding position of
        AUPS fall below an agreed threshold. At 31 July 2013 £1,120,512 (2012: £783,652) had accumulated in the
        restricted account.

        The University expects to contribute £1,700,000 to the Aston University Pension Scheme in 2013-14.

        The University participated in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) multi- employer scheme. The
        University had one active member in the LGPS who retired in 2012-13 whereupon the scheme was closed for
        Aston University active members. Until 2011-12, this scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution
        scheme. In 2011-12 the University reviewed this policy, and decided to account for the scheme as a defined
        benefit scheme in accordance with FRS 17 based upon an actuarial valuation of the fund by the scheme’s
        qualified independent actuary. For 2012-13, the accounting for LGPS was changed from FRS 17: Retirement
        Benefits to FRS 12: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (note 18).
                                                                                  
        The following information relates to the University’s part of the scheme, not the entire scheme.
                                                                                  
        The assumptions used by the actuary are:
