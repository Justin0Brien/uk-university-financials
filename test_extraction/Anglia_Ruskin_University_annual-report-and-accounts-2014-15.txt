Provisions are recognised when the University has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that
a transfer of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.
The pension provision is in respect of enhanced pension entitlements of staff taking early retirement from 1989 to date. The provision also
includes accrued liabilities in respect of the strain placed on TPS funds (see note 28 for further details).

     Anglia Ruskin University’s employees belong to two principal pension schemes, the Teachers’ Pension Scheme England and Wales (TPS) for academic
     and related staff; and the Essex County Council Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) for non-teaching staff, which is managed by Essex County
     Council. Both are defined benefit schemes. The Group also administers a stakeholder pension scheme.

     The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independant qualified actuaries. The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS was 31 March
     2012 and of the LGPS 31 March 2013.                                          
     Contributions amounting to £1,057,173 (2014 £1,034,286) were payable to the schemes at 31 July and are included within creditors.
     Teachers’ Pension Scheme                                                     
     The Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) is a statutory, contributory, defined benefit scheme, governed by the Teachers’ Pension Regulations 2010, and from
     1 April 2014, by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme Regulations 2014. These regulations apply to teachers in schools and other educational establishments,
     including academies, in England and Wales maintained by local authorities. In addition, teachers in many independent and voluntary-aided schools and
     lecturers in some establishments of further and higher education may be eligible for membership. Membership is automatic for full-time teachers and
     lecturers and from 1 January 2007, automatic too for teachers and lecturers in part-time employment following appointment or a change of contract.
     Teachers and lecturers are able to opt out of the TPS.                       
     The Teachers’ Pension Budgeting and Valuation Account                        
     Although members may be employed by various bodies, their retirement and other pension benefits are set in regulations made under the
     Superannuation Act 1972 and are paid by public funds provided by Parliament. The TPS is an unfunded scheme and members contribute on a ‘pay as
     you go’ basis - these contributions, along with those made by employers, are credited to the Exchequer under arrangements governed by the above Act.
     The Teachers’ Pension Regulations 2010 require an annual account, the Teachers’ Pension Budgeting and Valuation Account, to be kept of receipts and
     expenditure (including the cost of pensions’ increases). From 1 April 2001, the Account has been credited with a real rate of return which is equivalent to
     assuming that the balance in the Account is invested in notional investments that produce that real rate of return.
     Valuation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme                                    
     The latest actuarial review of the TPS was carried out as at 31 March 2012 and in accordance with The Public Service Pensions (Valuations and Employer
     Cost Cap) Directions 2014. The valuation report was published by the Department of Education (the Department) on 9 June 2014. The key results of the
     valuation are:                                                               
     • employer contribution rates were set at 16.4% of pensionable pay;          
     • total scheme liabilities for service to the effective date of £191.5 billion, and notional assets of £176.6 billion, giving a notional past service deficit of
      £14.9 billion;                                                              
     • an employer cost cap of 10.9% of pensionable pay                           
     The new employer contribution rate for the TPS was implemented in September 2015.

     Following the Hutton report in March 2011 and the subsequent consultations with trade unions and other representative bodies on reform of the TPS, the
     Department published a Proposed Final Agreement, setting out the design for a reformed TPS to be implemented from 1 April 2015.
     The key provisions of the reformed scheme include: a pension based on career average earnings; an accrual rate of 1/57th; and a Normal Pension Age
     equal to State Pension Age, but with options to enable members to retire earlier or later than their Normal Pension Age. Importantly, pension benefits
     built up before 1 April 2015 will be fully protected.                        
     In addition, the Proposed Final Agreement includes a Government commitment that those within 10 years of Normal Pension Age on 1 April 2012 will see
     no change to the age at which they can retire, and no decrease in the amount of pension they receive when they retire. There will be further transitional
     protection, tapered over a three and a half year period, for people who would fall up to three and a half years outside of the 10 year protection.
     Regulations giving effect to a reformed Teachers’ Pension Scheme came into force on 1 April 2014 and the reformed scheme commenced on
     1 April 2015.                                                                
     The total Group contributions made for the year ended 31 July 2015 were £7,161,247 (2014: £6,674,631), of which employers’ contributions totalled
     £4,102,392 (2014: £3,921,051) and employees’ contributions totalled £3,058,855 (2014: £2,753,580).

Scheme Changes
Following the Hutton report in March 2011 and the subsequent consultations with trade unions and other representative bodies on reform of the TPS, the

The key provisions of the reformed scheme include: a pension based on career average earnings; an accrual rate of 1/57th; and a Normal Pension Age
equal to State Pension Age, but with options to enable members to retire earlier or later than their Normal Pension Age. Importantly, pension benefits

     Under the definitions set out in Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 Retirement Benefits, the TPS is a multi-employer scheme. Anglia Ruskin University
     is unable to identify its share of the underlying (notional) assets of the scheme. Accordingly, Anglia Ruskin has adopted the appropriate treatment in FRS
     17 and has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Anglia Ruskin has set out above the information
     available on the scheme and the implications for Anglia Ruskin in terms of contribution rates.
     Actuarial scheme valuations are dependant on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and many other factors. Many of these
     are being discussed in the context of the design for a reformed TPS, as set out in the Proposed Final Agreement, and scheme valuations are, therefore,
     currently suspended. The Government however, has set out a future process for determining the employer contribution rate under the new scheme, and
     this process will involve a full actuarial valuation.                        
     LGPS                                                                         
     The LGPS is a funded defined benefit scheme, with the assets held in a separately administered fund held by Essex County Council.
     The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, Barnett Waddingham, using the projected unit method.
     The latest actuarial valuation was at 31 March 2013.                         
     The total Group contributions made for the year ended 31 July 2015 were £7,100,995 (2014: £6,580,830), of which employers’ contributions totalled
     £4,885,987 (2014: £4,576,358) and employees’ contributions totalled £2,215,008 (2014: £2,004,472).
     From 1 April 2014 the employees’ rates varied between 5.5% and 12.5%, based on the employee salary bands.
     The employer rate from 1 April 2014 was 11.2% and from 1 April 2015 was 11.4%.
     (a) The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return                 
     The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectations, at the beginning of the period, for investment returns
     over the entire life of the related obligation. The assumption used is the average of the following assumptions appropriate
     to the individual asset classes weighted by the proportion of the assets in the particular asset classes.
     The rates quoted are gross of expenses.

     For accounting years beginning on or after 1 January 2015, the expected rate of return and the interest cost will be replaced with a single net interest cost,
     which will effectively set the expected return equal to the discount rate. Therefore we are not required to disclose an expected return assumption for the
     year ending 31 July 2016.                                                    
     For the year ended 31 July 2015, the expected return was 4.2% per annum, which has been used to determine the profit and loss charge for the year
     ended 31 July 2015.

FRS 17
Under the definitions set out in Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 Retirement Benefits, the TPS is a multi-employer scheme. Anglia Ruskin University
is unable to identify its share of the underlying (notional) assets of the scheme. Accordingly, Anglia Ruskin has adopted the appropriate treatment in FRS
17 and has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Anglia Ruskin has set out above the information
available on the scheme and the implications for Anglia Ruskin in terms of contribution rates.
Actuarial scheme valuations are dependant on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and many other factors. Many of these
are being discussed in the context of the design for a reformed TPS, as set out in the Proposed Final Agreement, and scheme valuations are, therefore,
currently suspended. The Government however, has set out a future process for determining the employer contribution rate under the new scheme, and
this process will involve a full actuarial valuation.
LGPS
The LGPS is a funded defined benefit scheme, with the assets held in a separately administered fund held by Essex County Council.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, Barnett Waddingham, using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation was at 31 March 2013.
The total Group contributions made for the year ended 31 July 2015 were £7,100,995 (2014: £6,580,830), of which employers’ contributions totalled
£4,885,987 (2014: £4,576,358) and employees’ contributions totalled £2,215,008 (2014: £2,004,472).
From 1 April 2014 the employees’ rates varied between 5.5% and 12.5%, based on the employee salary bands.
The employer rate from 1 April 2014 was 11.2% and from 1 April 2015 was 11.4%.
(a) The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return
The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectations, at the beginning of the period, for investment returns
over the entire life of the related obligation. The assumption used is the average of the following assumptions appropriate
to the individual asset classes weighted by the proportion of the assets in the particular asset classes.
The rates quoted are gross of expenses.

For accounting years beginning on or after 1 January 2015, the expected rate of return and the interest cost will be replaced with a single net interest cost,
which will effectively set the expected return equal to the discount rate. Therefore we are not required to disclose an expected return assumption for the
year ending 31 July 2016.
For the year ended 31 July 2015, the expected return was 4.2% per annum, which has been used to determine the profit and loss charge for the year
ended 31 July 2015.

     Early retirement costs met by Anglia Ruskin University                       
     The University holds a provision in respect of enhanced pension entitlements of staff taking early retirement.
     Interest of £107k (2014: £124k) has been charged to the income and expenditure account. In addition, a further £250k (2014: £250k) has been charged
     to the income and expenditure account. Both the interest and the additional charge are included in note 17a. The provision is released against the cost
     to Anglia Ruskin of enhanced pension entitlements over the estimated life expectancy of each relevant employee. The calculation of the cost of early
     retirement charged to the income and expenditure account in the year of retirement is based on the total capital cost of providing enhanced pensions
     with allowance for future investment returns at 4.5% in excess of price inflation.
     A requirement for the employer to meet the cost of the strain placed upon the funds from early retirements was introduced from 1 April 1996 for the LGPS
     and 1 July 1997 for the TPS. In the case of the latter, a provision is also made for liabilities accrued in this respect.
     Liabilities incurred in this regard for the LGPS fund are paid in the year they are accrued.

     The grants are related disbursements and are therefore excluded from the income and expenditure account.

     The 2014 accounts have been restated where applicable for reasons of comparability.
     Included in the fixed asset note is a reclassification between asset classes, although this has no impact on the overall net book value of these assets.
